In fact, one of my favorite things about Prime 2 is that it (at least in theory) *wasn't* a galactic-scale threat.  Samus was sent to investigate something too small-time to warrant the attention of a GF armada, and she ended up having to save the dwindling population of a single world.  Not everything has to be a galactic apocalypse.  I like the idea of Samus being a lonely warrior being sent to put out random brushfires that are devastating to the populace, but don't matter to the galaxy at large.\n\nBut I also like the idea of using actually useful military tech.  \"Dude with a gun\" is horribly outdated in an age of spaceships that break physics in half to go faster than light.  The fact that Samus is still a useful military asset as a humanoid body in an age of drones and orbital strikes *should* make her an ultrabadass.  But that's just me and my scifi tastes.  I also come from the Babylon 5 end of the spectrum, so I like the idea of these ancient and powerful aliens whose agents in the \"lower levels\" of the galaxy are feared for simply containing a fraction of their power, the Vorlon enhanced psychics being analogous to Samus in this case.  Even the fraction of the Chozo's might in her suit should be feared.  \n\nI would like to say that I think this is interesting; that I like the Space Opera stuff with the Chozo and colossal scales of time and space (my headcanon has always been that Samus is several centuries old), and other people like the military stuff with Adam (in theory), and that the Metroid universe *should* be big enough for both with it's limited exposition and focus on exploration.

We won the Battle of the Citadel *long* before we even knew we were fighting it. It was just coincidence that you happened to kill the Saren body at the same time Sovereign died due to damage taken from the fleet.\n\nOf course, this is probably just me projecting because I love ME1 so much and Sovereign had a wonderfully tragic character arc if you look it like this.
