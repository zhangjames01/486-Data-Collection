Bread flour gives you an advantage in this regard as it has a high enough protein content to give you a good gluten network/strength later. All-purpose doughs, in my experience, dissolve into unmanageable soup. Get yourself some bread flour and you will definitely notice a difference.\n\n2) Did you starter double in 3-4 hours? That's a good indicator of how well your starter will help with the rise of your dough. I also tend to feed my starter at a 1:2:2 ratio by weight before a bake. E.g. 20g starter, 40g water (at 85\u00b0F, this helps kickstart the yeast) and 40g organic rye flour. This gives the yeast a ton of food to munch on in order to propagate. I also let my starter rise in a warm spot in my house.\n\n3) Did you mix dough and starter, then let it rest before you mixed in the salt? Salt will sometimes delay the onset of rise, so I incorporate the starter and autolyse mix, give it 30 mins to rest, and then add salt.\n\n4) How long were your rest periods between mixing your dough and between your folds? If your starter is sufficiently active and you're giving yourself 30-45 mins between folds, you should start seeing your dough rising even as you're in the stretch and fold stage of your bulk ferment.\n\n5) You mentioned your dough was in a colder environment - if you're not noticing good rise even with sufficient rest time between folds, keep it in the warmer environment the whole time. You should notice the difference. I think what happened is it was too cool, and once you moved it to a warmer environment, it overproofed - especially with the extended length of time. Depending on the bread, my bulk ferments tend to only take 6-8 hours from the time the starter hits the autolyse mix to the time it goes into the fridge for cold proof.\n\n6) How hot was your oven? Your dough looks quite pale.\n\n7) What did your bake look like? 20/25/etc. mins with the steam source? When was the pot of water removed and how long after its removal did you let the bread continue to bake for?\n\nSorry if these are a lot of questions.
