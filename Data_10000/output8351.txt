I had a personal goal of creating 1 instagram story for each ascent which had multiple motivations, keeping me committed and accountable, promoting my stream to help get more people to chat with, and to document the inevitable decline in mood.\n\nI haven't written my post race recap/journal yet, but I think these 1 minute clips will be invaluable when I do.\n\nAll that is to say I will review my little 1 minute stories now and walk you through my mental state, also, I started around 9pm:\n\nThe first several I felt great and I'm mostly describing what Everesting is.\n\n3:30am 6 hours in: Still optimistic, I describe that I was thinking 13-15 hours, closer to 15 hours really, but that I'm pacing for under 12 hours and that seems crazy to me. (Looking back now I probably let myself start out too string. Ascents 1-4 my normalized power is 215, 214, 214, 217. That's when I made this story. The rest of my ascents NP goes: 199, 173, 159, 175, and the last half ascent is 192.)\n\n3:34am I had a bonus story here where I mention my anxiety disorder and how endurance events can mimic or trigger symptoms similar to a panic attack. And how we can use these opportunities to work on centering ourselves and breathwork and it's good exposure therapy. (I mentioned this because I think during the previous descent was the first time I started getting negative feelings of doubt. Also my brother had outlasted all my friends chatting with me on Twitch to this point, but he left around this time so I was now actually alone for the first times of the ride)\n\n4:41am I'll just quote the first thing I say: \"If you've come here for pain, you've come to the right place. I am feeling it. The plane has hit the gd mountain.\" lol. a bit dramatic, I mention I am watching a movie now, no one is left chatting with me, my power numbers and times have dropped and slowed. Just trying to survive now, putting one foot in front of the other, things are starting to hurt.\n\n6:21am I show that I'm at 20k ft ascended in 8h30m and this surpasses my previous best Everesting attempt.\n\n6:23am Finished lap 6. Things are dark. Let me preface this by saying my goal with these stories was to show people me being completely vulnerable. I was expecting to show a story of me just crying at some point. I remember during the previous ascent I was having darkness and dread but also balanced by waves of love a oneness of the world. Almost like an experience described by LSD or mushrooms. I had been doing all my stories after my descent break, and for some reason when I got off the bike for the descent and refilled my water bottles things always got way darker. So in this story I speak of the love and oneness, but my eyes are kind of devoid, and this was the story where I really thought I might tear up. I mention I'm just going to keep putting \"one foot in front of the other\" and that I consider this\" 7th ascent to be my penultimate lap which I'm sure will be the hardest yet\".\n\nI remember my mom joined my chat at like 5:50am(before my previous story) and I honestly almost burst into tears while responding to her.\n\n8:11am Finished lap 7: I am out of the dark now, I say I feel this is totally achievable, I'll just be going as slow as I need to achieve this. I say a couple times that I feel mellowed out. A lot of friends have woken up and joined me back on twitch chat.\n\n9:52am: Final half ascent is starting, adrenaline is carrying me.\n\n10:51am: I do a final update from the couch. I wanted to have some closure for anyone who was just following these stories. I will say the more euphoric ending was on Twitch and my wife joined me with our 7 month old daughter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Lap 6 was the darkest, also the loneliest, which may have lead to it. It had lows and highs though, it also had the most serene waves of love and oneness. Although lap 6 was the worst, I think it was also why we choose to do these challenges. As someone who is almost 8 years sober I'd say lap 6 was the closest I get to doing drugs, lol.\n\nIf anyone cares enough to want to watch these stories, you can checkout jesse2dags on instagram.

I had a personal goal of creating 1 instagram story for each ascent which had multiple motivations, keeping me committed and accountable, promoting my stream to help get more people to chat with, and to document the inevitable decline in mood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t written my post race recap/journal yet, but I think these 1 minute clips will be invaluable when I do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that is to say I will review my little 1 minute stories now and walk you through my mental state, also, I started around 9pm:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first several I felt great and I&amp;#39;m mostly describing what Everesting is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3:30am 6 hours in: Still optimistic, I describe that I was thinking 13-15 hours, closer to 15 hours really, but that I&amp;#39;m pacing for under 12 hours and that seems crazy to me. (Looking back now I probably let myself start out too string. Ascents 1-4 my normalized power is 215, 214, 214, 217. That&amp;#39;s when I made this story. The rest of my ascents NP goes: 199, 173, 159, 175, and the last half ascent is 192.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3:34am I had a bonus story here where I mention my anxiety disorder and how endurance events can mimic or trigger symptoms similar to a panic attack. And how we can use these opportunities to work on centering ourselves and breathwork and it&amp;#39;s good exposure therapy. (I mentioned this because I think during the previous descent was the first time I started getting negative feelings of doubt. Also my brother had outlasted all my friends chatting with me on Twitch to this point, but he left around this time so I was now actually alone for the first times of the ride)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4:41am I&amp;#39;ll just quote the first thing I say: &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;ve come here for pain, you&amp;#39;ve come to the right place. I am feeling it. The plane has hit the gd mountain.&amp;quot; lol. a bit dramatic, I mention I am watching a movie now, no one is left chatting with me, my power numbers and times have dropped and slowed. Just trying to survive now, putting one foot in front of the other, things are starting to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6:21am I show that I&amp;#39;m at 20k ft ascended in 8h30m and this surpasses my previous best Everesting attempt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6:23am Finished lap 6. Things are dark. Let me preface this by saying my goal with these stories was to show people me being completely vulnerable. I was expecting to show a story of me just crying at some point. I remember during the previous ascent I was having darkness and dread but also balanced by waves of love a oneness of the world. Almost like an experience described by LSD or mushrooms. I had been doing all my stories after my descent break, and for some reason when I got off the bike for the descent and refilled my water bottles things always got way darker. So in this story I speak of the love and oneness, but my eyes are kind of devoid, and this was the story where I really thought I might tear up. I mention I&amp;#39;m just going to keep putting &amp;quot;one foot in front of the other&amp;quot; and that I consider this&amp;quot; 7th ascent to be my penultimate lap which I&amp;#39;m sure will be the hardest yet&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember my mom joined my chat at like 5:50am(before my previous story) and I honestly almost burst into tears while responding to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8:11am Finished lap 7: I am out of the dark now, I say I feel this is totally achievable, I&amp;#39;ll just be going as slow as I need to achieve this. I say a couple times that I feel mellowed out. A lot of friends have woken up and joined me back on twitch chat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9:52am: Final half ascent is starting, adrenaline is carrying me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10:51am: I do a final update from the couch. I wanted to have some closure for anyone who was just following these stories. I will say the more euphoric ending was on Twitch and my wife joined me with our 7 month old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Lap 6 was the darkest, also the loneliest, which may have lead to it. It had lows and highs though, it also had the most serene waves of love and oneness. Although lap 6 was the worst, I think it was also why we choose to do these challenges. As someone who is almost 8 years sober I&amp;#39;d say lap 6 was the closest I get to doing drugs, lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone cares enough to want to watch these stories, you can checkout jesse2dags on instagram.
