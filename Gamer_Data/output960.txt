Part of the interview process was a presentation on a topic of my choice so I spoke about my relationship with board games, how I teach them, and the benefits they have for students.\n\nThe examples I used were a little more general, because I was talking about the benefits of board gaming as an extracurricular activity and not specifically for use in English classes but I have a few recommendations. I definitely agree with **Codenames**, especially because the whole class could play together instead of breaking down into smaller groups!\n\nI would highly recommend **Concept** (although I don't own it...yet!). A huge part of teaching English (at least in my country) is focused on communication and Concept is all about being able to convey abstract ideas using no words and very literal pictures. So, if a card said 'snowman' then you might put a marker on the symbols for 'white', 'sphere' and 'snow'.\n\nThen there's **Bananagrams** which is a bit like **Scrabble** but it's easier and supports more players\u2014great for the classroom since you'd need 15+ Scrabble sets to support your average class where you'd only need three or four copies of Bananagrams. It, like Scrabble, is about building a sort of crossword puzzle but instead of two people building it together all the players build their own individual one. Great for getting kids to think about words and particularly their spellings. In the rules, it says that a single word spelled wrong will negate your win but with middle school kids I'd probably play it a bit more leniently!\n\nGames like **Betrayal at House on the Hill** aren't *strictly* educational but it'd likely be useful if any part of the course deals with short story writing/theme and particularly horror. It's pretty common for kids to write horror stories in English classes because it's a really obvious genre with tropes that they can understand easily and Betrayal could be a way to potentially tap into that and start them thinking about it. It's also got quite a bit of card text that's intended to be read out loud and that never goes wrong!\n\nThose are the sort of English-specific suggestions I have, in terms of their benefits, but there's other ways to implement them in classes\u2014especially shorter games. I'm kind of assuming US schools work the same way, so forgive me if they don't, but at the end of a unit of work kids will usually have a class or two where they do something a little bit more relaxing but still educational and that would be a great place to tie in a few games that were related to the content. I don't what kind of texts your girlfriend teaches (I imagine they're pretty different because we have quite a big focus on Scottish literature here) so I'll give a few random examples that she'd definitely be able to build on\u2014these are probably at a higher level than middle school. \n\nIf they read The Narrative of Frederick Douglass then that could be rounded off with a game like **Freedom: The Underground Railroad**. If they read something like The Turn of the Screw or another ghost story then they could play **Mysterium**. If they did The Crucible then they could play **New Salem**, where players are split into teams of the 'righteous' who carried out the executions and the witches (could be iffy because it implies that there actually *were* witches and that seems to justify the murders in a way that could be inappropriate for the classroom\u2014there are quite a few games like this that seem like a great addition at first glance but need to be approached with caution). Moby Dick could work with **New Bedford**, a game that was Kickstarted earlier this year, and Romeo and Juliet would obviously go with **Council of Verona**.\n\nIf you get her to tell you the kinds of themes she's working with, I'm sure you'll be find something for it out there in the board game world! I'd be happy to help with this so shoot me a PM with the specifics at some point if you want to.\n\nAs for games that relate to other subjects...well, almost all games have some kind of educational value (let's not talk about Cards Against Humanity)! I would look at the games she already enjoys and would like to share with her class and work out what the positives are. It can be as simple as learning to add up quickly while working out points in **Ticket to Ride** or learning to make good decisions quickly or to think strategically or it can be games that teach teamwork skills like **Flashpoint: Fire Rescue**, negotiation like **Cosmic Encounter**, or deduction like **Love Letter** or **The Resistance** (Avalon being particularly good for English). It could even just ones that help students to foster friendships with one another.\n\nThis comment went on quite a bit longer than intended\u2014sorry, it's a side effect of the English degree... I hope my rambling was somewhat useful to you, if you've got any questions about anything then ask away. Good luck in your search!\n\n/u/r2d8 getinfo short", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "takenoko", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Takenoko"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a teacher yet, but I did just get offered a place on a training course for high school English next year so consider me almost qualified!

It&amp;#39;s also got quite a bit of card text that&amp;#39;s intended to be read out loud and that never goes wrong!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those are the sort of English-specific suggestions I have, in terms of their benefits, but there&amp;#39;s other ways to implement them in classes\u2014especially shorter games. I&amp;#39;m kind of assuming US schools work the same way, so forgive me if they don&amp;#39;t, but at the end of a unit of work kids will usually have a class or two where they do something a little bit more relaxing but still educational and that would be a great place to tie in a few games that were related to the content. I don&amp;#39;t what kind of texts your girlfriend teaches (I imagine they&amp;#39;re pretty different because we have quite a big focus on Scottish literature here) so I&amp;#39;ll give a few random examples that she&amp;#39;d definitely be able to build on\u2014these are probably at a higher level than middle school. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they read The Narrative of Frederick Douglass then that could be rounded off with a game like &lt;strong&gt;Freedom: The Underground Railroad&lt;/strong&gt;. If they read something like The Turn of the Screw or another ghost story then they could play &lt;strong&gt;Mysterium&lt;/strong&gt;. If they did The Crucible then they could play &lt;strong&gt;New Salem&lt;/strong&gt;, where players are split into teams of the &amp;#39;righteous&amp;#39; who carried out the executions and the witches (could be iffy because it implies that there actually &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; witches and that seems to justify the murders in a way that could be inappropriate for the classroom\u2014there are quite a few games like this that seem like a great addition at first glance but need to be approached with caution). Moby Dick could work with &lt;strong&gt;New Bedford&lt;/strong&gt;, a game that was Kickstarted earlier this year, and Romeo and Juliet would obviously go with &lt;strong&gt;Council of Verona&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you get her to tell you the kinds of themes she&amp;#39;s working with, I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll be find something for it out there in the board game world! I&amp;#39;d be happy to help with this so shoot me a PM with the specifics at some point if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for games that relate to other subjects...well, almost all games have some kind of educational value (let&amp;#39;s not talk about Cards Against Humanity)! I would look at the games she already enjoys and would like to share with her class and work out what the positives are. It can be as simple as learning to add up quickly while working out points in &lt;strong&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;/strong&gt; or learning to make good decisions quickly or to think strategically or it can be games that teach teamwork skills like &lt;strong&gt;Flashpoint: Fire Rescue&lt;/strong&gt;, negotiation like &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/strong&gt;, or deduction like &lt;strong&gt;Love Letter&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;The Resistance&lt;/strong&gt; (Avalon being particularly good for English). It could even just ones that help students to foster friendships with one another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This comment went on quite a bit longer than intended\u2014sorry, it&amp;#39;s a side effect of the English degree... I hope my rambling was somewhat useful to you, if you&amp;#39;ve got any questions about anything then ask away.

It&amp;#39;s good but not great: a decent filler but definitely not something to pick up if you&amp;#39;re looking for more than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Realms&lt;/strong&gt; is excellent, I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;ve probably played that most out of all my small card games. It&amp;#39;s cool that it&amp;#39;s got the flexibility to go to more players (with more sets) but since I&amp;#39;m one half of a gaming couple it suits us just fine to buy 2p only games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the &lt;strong&gt;Mage Knight&lt;/strong&gt; input, I&amp;#39;ve read a lot about it being fiddly. I think we&amp;#39;ll enjoy it but \u00a365 is a huge investment for something we might hate with the unbridled passion of a thousand suns...I think for now we&amp;#39;ll leave it on the back burner and focus on games that are going to see a lot of play. We can always get to it once the rest of our wishlist has been whittled down\u2014although it keeps growing, so who knows when that&amp;#39;ll happen!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominion&lt;/strong&gt; is another one I haven&amp;#39;t had a chance to play but it gets so much praise that I&amp;#39;m thinking about checking it out at some point, although I&amp;#39;m not sure it appeals that much to me after playing &lt;strong&gt;Star Realms&lt;/strong&gt; and acquiring &lt;strong&gt;Arctic Scavengers&lt;/strong&gt; (currently sitting in its shrinkwrap, trying to tempt me to open it). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I think our wishlists pretty much match up\u2014but that was almost inevitable, I think mine is approaching 200 games and I only really started playing seriously this year...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3fwdi9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/3fwdi9/comc_wsig_i_finally_have_almost_all_my_board/ctsv1qf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3fwdi9/comc_wsig_i_finally_have_almost_all_my_board/", "name": "t1_ctsv1qf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "author_flair_text": "Takenoko", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1438812513.0, "created_utc": 1438812513.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3fwdi9/comc_wsig_i_finally_have_almost_all_my_board/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[COMC] [WSIG] I finally have (almost) all my board games in one place!", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "boardgames", "link_author": "dred1367", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ctsp7f5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "sociable-sociopath", "num_comments": 11, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3fwdi9", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_a5ip4", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Seems like we've got pretty similar taste!

It's a trading game, very very fun. It often feels like there's no clear winner and it's interesting to see how the final scores play out\u2014one of us might sell more diamonds, so it seems like that person *should* win, but then the other managed to sell five leather at once and picked up the 10-point bonus chit or has the most camels. Can't recommend it highly enough.\n- **Star Realms** \u2014 This is a great game although we have noticed that it can sometimes seem a little too luck-based. If the trade row consistently gives your opponent all the cards they want while you're stuck buying a few explorers until your (space)ship comes in, it can feel unbalanced. We have a lot of fun with this one anyway and it feels does feel predominantly skill-based...most of the time.\n- **Lost Cities**\u2014We've had a couple of games of this and it's a good time. I wouldn't say that we like it quite as much as the games above but it is fun. It's the world's most pasted-on theme and you could play it with a regular deck of cards if you wanted to (each colour is a suit, Ace through 10 are the numbered cards, face cards are wagers).\n- **Coup** \u2014 A lot of people say this isn't good two player but we've enjoyed it. There's no doubt that it's *better* with more people but the variant works just fine. Scratches that bluffing itch even when we don't have a big group.\n- **Guillotine**\u2014This is a great game. Quick, light but with just enough strategy to feel like you aren't at the mercy of the cards at all. Highly recommend it.\n- **Red7**\u2014We've played this...twice? Maybe three times. It hasn't grabbed our attention as much the others but we enjoy it well enough. We're long distance at the moment and didn't have time to get more plays in so it's entirely probable that it will grow on us. We played with the simple rules where the hand your dealt is all you get throughout the game and this made it so there was pretty much a clear winner just based on how good the hand was.

It often feels like there&amp;#39;s no clear winner and it&amp;#39;s interesting to see how the final scores play out\u2014one of us might sell more diamonds, so it seems like that person &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; win, but then the other managed to sell five leather at once and picked up the 10-point bonus chit or has the most camels. Can&amp;#39;t recommend it highly enough.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Realms&lt;/strong&gt; \u2014 This is a great game although we have noticed that it can sometimes seem a little too luck-based. If the trade row consistently gives your opponent all the cards they want while you&amp;#39;re stuck buying a few explorers until your (space)ship comes in, it can feel unbalanced. We have a lot of fun with this one anyway and it feels does feel predominantly skill-based...most of the time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost Cities&lt;/strong&gt;\u2014We&amp;#39;ve had a couple of games of this and it&amp;#39;s a good time. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say that we like it quite as much as the games above but it is fun. It&amp;#39;s the world&amp;#39;s most pasted-on theme and you could play it with a regular deck of cards if you wanted to (each colour is a suit, Ace through 10 are the numbered cards, face cards are wagers).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coup&lt;/strong&gt; \u2014 A lot of people say this isn&amp;#39;t good two player but we&amp;#39;ve enjoyed it. There&amp;#39;s no doubt that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; with more people but the variant works just fine. Scratches that bluffing itch even when we don&amp;#39;t have a big group.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guillotine&lt;/strong&gt;\u2014This is a great game. Quick, light but with just enough strategy to feel like you aren&amp;#39;t at the mercy of the cards at all. Highly recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red7&lt;/strong&gt;\u2014We&amp;#39;ve played this...twice? Maybe three times. It hasn&amp;#39;t grabbed our attention as much the others but we enjoy it well enough. We&amp;#39;re long distance at the moment and didn&amp;#39;t have time to get more plays in so it&amp;#39;s entirely probable that it will grow on us. We played with the simple rules where the hand your dealt is all you get throughout the game and this made it so there was pretty much a clear winner just based on how good the hand was.
