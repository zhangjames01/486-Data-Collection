You&amp;#39;d likely find that it was basically impossible to compare, as they just won&amp;#39;t be trying to be potty trained at the same time (3 is nearly average for US parents using diapers, and a 3 year old is just different than a 2 year old). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EC is a bit heavier on laundry (fairly obviously), and the laundry load in the first few weeks is insane to start with (pro tip: just get allergy friendly detergent, skip the infant stuff). If you are doing EC you will want somewhat different outfits (you don&amp;#39;t want anything that is too tricky to open). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I remember those waiting days, and it is hard because there is both everything and nothing to do.
