I think the North vs South  differences can be succinctly put into that: Laozi (and Daoism) originated in the South at roughly the same time Confucius was doing stuff up north.  Southerners tend to be more laid back, but also get angry a bit faster.  I&amp;#39;ve heard Guangdong natives refer to themselves as more emotional than northerners. Northerners on the other hand tend to be a lot more in control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This has changed a bit in recent years, given mass migrations and Shanghai&amp;#39;s sphere of influence sort of developing its own culture, but I think it&amp;#39;s still a pretty apt way to look at things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_qw3fi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/China/comments/qw3fi/question_about_cantonese_culture/c412f39/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/qw3fi/question_about_cantonese_culture/", "name": "t1_c412f39", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/China", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1331760292.0, "created_utc": 1331760292.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/qw3fi/question_about_cantonese_culture/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2v", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Which city is best for an American to move to?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "China", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c412arn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "magkaser", "num_comments": 26, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_qwnu4", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_5t74k", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably Hangzhou or Nanjing.
