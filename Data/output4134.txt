Your logo and web design works well withing the style guide and branding of the project. It's a bit to convoluted, and feels like \"I grabbed some JavaScript libraries and jammed something together\". It also feels a bit dated, like a portfolio from 10 years ago. The lightbox viewer to view the actual work isn't helping either. Your only using 50% of the screen real estate. Try to create a dedicated page for every case. And roll it out with more white space for more room to breath. The current design isn't doing your work justice.\n\nThe work on your portfolio is great. And you have a nice selection of different things. Try to open up the design more and keep things simple (Keep It Simple Stupid). So no alternate font rollover effect, no lightbox, Select a different font for headers and body copy.\n\nLook for some inspiration on: https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/search?text=portfolio&amp;type=post\n\nThe website does not have to be as eccentric and complex in animation as these. But look a the structures and design, font selection, etc. Most of these have a lot simple elements, big images, whitespace, no drop shadows or transparent boxes. Try to think outside of the world of bootstrap and standardized web development tools and libraries.\n\nNext to that, as I've also mentioned on catarinacruzr's reply, networking is very important, if not more important. I know that is difficult when you come into an new country. There are events like ADnight where you can visit different ad agencies and network, show your work. I know a few expat designers that got their first job trough it, then get to know everyone in the company and find other jobs trough that local network. \n\nI've written this doc 3 years ago for someone in a similar position as yourself. It might not apply fully to your situation, but it might have some tips that could be useful.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvTQ7nei0K5HnhdG2BlC10F8C21s0ZqpVBWjDIosv38/edit?usp=sharing\n\nJust keep on working and learning. Also look a different creative categories and industries. I get a lot of my inspiration for interactive elements in websites and design choices from videogames and cool motion graphics. I also try and learn what aspects of other disciplines are valuable, and what people in those fields think and find important. Knowing how a designer thinks helps me tons in how to approach a specific task, anticipating what a designer wants. Or even better making something they didn't even know they wanted.\n\nHope there's something in here that helps you.

Your logo and web design works well withing the style guide and branding of the project. It&amp;#39;s a bit to convoluted, and feels like &amp;quot;I grabbed some JavaScript libraries and jammed something together&amp;quot;. It also feels a bit dated, like a portfolio from 10 years ago. The lightbox viewer to view the actual work isn&amp;#39;t helping either. Your only using 50% of the screen real estate. Try to create a dedicated page for every case. And roll it out with more white space for more room to breath. The current design isn&amp;#39;t doing your work justice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The work on your portfolio is great. And you have a nice selection of different things. Try to open up the design more and keep things simple (Keep It Simple Stupid). So no alternate font rollover effect, no lightbox, Select a different font for headers and body copy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look for some inspiration on: &lt;a href=\"https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/search?text=portfolio&amp;amp;type=post\"&gt;https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/search?text=portfolio&amp;amp;type=post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The website does not have to be as eccentric and complex in animation as these. But look a the structures and design, font selection, etc. Most of these have a lot simple elements, big images, whitespace, no drop shadows or transparent boxes. Try to think outside of the world of bootstrap and standardized web development tools and libraries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next to that, as I&amp;#39;ve also mentioned on catarinacruzr&amp;#39;s reply, networking is very important, if not more important. I know that is difficult when you come into an new country. There are events like ADnight where you can visit different ad agencies and network, show your work. I know a few expat designers that got their first job trough it, then get to know everyone in the company and find other jobs trough that local network. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve written this doc 3 years ago for someone in a similar position as yourself. It might not apply fully to your situation, but it might have some tips that could be useful.\n&lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvTQ7nei0K5HnhdG2BlC10F8C21s0ZqpVBWjDIosv38/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wvTQ7nei0K5HnhdG2BlC10F8C21s0ZqpVBWjDIosv38/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just keep on working and learning. Also look a different creative categories and industries. I get a lot of my inspiration for interactive elements in websites and design choices from videogames and cool motion graphics. I also try and learn what aspects of other disciplines are valuable, and what people in those fields think and find important. Knowing how a designer thinks helps me tons in how to approach a specific task, anticipating what a designer wants. Or even better making something they didn&amp;#39;t even know they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope there&amp;#39;s something in here that helps you.
