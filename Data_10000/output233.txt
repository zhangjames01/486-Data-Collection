We&amp;#39;re trying to be responsible citizens and consumers, but it&amp;#39;s hard to change much when we&amp;#39;re scraping by paycheck-to-paycheck and depending on our parents for support. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ppl like this ^ just make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What am I making worse? I lucked out - a friend of a friend of a friend was willing to make a position for me in their office. It has okay benefits, reasonable hours and expectations, and I&amp;#39;m having good professional experiences. But the pay is abysmal and it&amp;#39;s in a rural part of another state (which is a concern in a licensed profession that doesn&amp;#39;t transfer easily). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, stoicism is my overarching personal philosophy. I don&amp;#39;t generally complain about much, especially in real life; I just gut it out. And that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing now. But it&amp;#39;s frustrating sometimes. I&amp;#39;ve spent twenty years of my life in school, doing pointless tasks in the name of &amp;quot;education.&amp;quot; I really didn&amp;#39;t want to, I&amp;#39;m a hands-on person and would have learned much more through an apprentice-type system. But society requires us to have degrees to even have a chance of success in office/white-collar professions. So I went to college and professional school. And now, instead of being done and being able to live my life just a little, I&amp;#39;ll have to spend another five, ten, or fifteen years fighting to get where I want to be professionally. So, sorry if I sometimes need to come onto an anonymous forum full of like-minded people and vent a little. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_12khyg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/lostgeneration/comments/12khyg/what_we_thought_graduating_college_would_be_like/c6wfks7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/12khyg/what_we_thought_graduating_college_would_be_like/", "name": "t1_c6wfks7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lostgeneration", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1352071291.0, "created_utc": 1352071291.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://i.imgur.com/8u0tk.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r40j", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What we thought graduating college would be like (xpost from r/community)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 9, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "lostgeneration", "link_author": "whiskeydeltatango", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c6w61mn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "notscrubsjd", "num_comments": 21, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_c6w2wrr", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_7us76", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You're probably a troll, but whatever.

It's fucked up that the economy is bad right now and we will have to work through hard times to make things work in the end. It's just fucked up, not fair for us. Just not fair!\n\nFirst of all, our generation isn't the one that fucked up the economy or created the \"college = job\" system, or drove up tuition, or created the student loan system. But we *are* the ones who are stuck dealing with it. Sorry if we want to vent just a little. \n\nSecond, most of the people that I know don't expect to \"be handed jobs and money.\" (And those that do - well, we didn't teach ourselves to expect that, did we?) I realize that's anecdotal and a gross generalization, but whatever. Most of us are actually willing to work hard and work our way up. Most of us just want a decent job that has reasonable benefits and pays fairly. Most of us don't want success handed to us, we just want the *opportunity* to be successful. But fuck us, right? \n\nI mean, for myself I just want a decent apartment in a safe area of town - nothing fancy, nothing huge, just something comfortable. I want a job with decent benefits so that if I get sick I can get treated instead of having to hope that it goes away. I want an income that covers my bills and taxes, with enough left over for some savings, and also for the occasional entertainment. Not a $200+ bar tab every weekend. I just don't want to feel guilty or worried when I go out for dinner and/or drinks with my friends on occasion. In other words, I just want a decent standard of living; I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation.  \n\nThe problem is, those first couple *minor* things - you know, decent housing, health insurance, *bills* - have gotten so retardedly expensive that it's hard to meet them with a single income, especially when you're a recent grad working at some shitty starter job (if you're lucky enough to be employed). So yeah, we're asking for, hoping for, larger salaries because we need the money just to get up to that decent standard of living. That's hardly our fault. \n\n&gt;Instead of doing anything to better myself or the economy I'm just going to sit around and bitch and wait for someone else to fix things. \n\nWhat are we supposed to do? Most of us are probably going to vote, but that's not really going to fix much regardless of which parties win. Those of us who have found jobs are working. Those of us who are unemployed are trying to find work. We're trying to work our way up. We're trying to be consumers. We're trying to pay our debts. But it's damn hard at the moment. \n\n&gt;That way when it's all better I can get a cozy desk job to pay the bills with my college degree.\n\nWhat's wrong with a \"cozy desk job\"? Not all of us want to be superstar rich uberprofessionals. Like I said above, most of us just want decent jobs that pay the bills and let us live. \n\nMy dad is a health care professional (not a doctor). He's excellent at his job - he has the highest patient satisfaction rating in his department. Yet he constantly gets in trouble with his supervisors for not having his paperwork done. Not because he's lazy - it's because he doesn't have time. Between actually treating patients, waiting for late patients to show up, making phone calls, dealing with prescriptions, helping coworkers, dealing with miscellaneous issues, and then actually trying to keep with the stupidly huge amounts of paperwork that health care demands (ever trying billing Medicare?) he winds up working a 16+ hour day on an eight-hour salary. It's destroyed his health, his ability to enjoy his job, and my parents' marriage. Meanwhile his supervisors sit in their offices working on useless advanced degrees. They don't offer any support. Hell, they probably don't even know how to treat a patient. All they do is send out bullshit emails about \"professionalism\" and \"integrity\" and \"it's a team effort\" and \"we need more productivity.\" Meanwhile my dad and his coworkers have all had to get remote access credentials so that they can work from home at night. And the supervisors continue to demand more. \n\nSo yeah, I'm okay with a \"cozy desk job.\" Maybe that makes me lazy, but I really don't care. I come in at 8. I leave at 5. I'm willing to work damn hard while I'm there, but when it's 5 I'm gone and my work stays on my desk. It's just a job, a thing I do for money.

Let me be clear, I believe that women get the ultimate decision; they are the ones who have to deal with pregnancy and birth. But if the woman decides to keep the child, the man is now a father, regardless of whether he wants to be, and is legally obligated to provide financial support.\n\nMy position, which I believe most MRAs share (the pro-choice ones, at least), is that a man should be able to legally opt out of fatherhood early on in the pregnancy, so that the woman can still legally obtain an abortion if she so chooses. \n\nLet me put it in context for you. Are you familiar with Dan Savage? He's a sex and relationship advice columnist/podcaster. In last week's column he answered a question from a pro-choice woman who had discovered that her boyfriend was pro-life. The question set-off a huge debate in the comment section (which spilled over into this week's column, after Dan printed a retraction of his advice from last week). \n\nThe feminist position - the dominant position in the comments - was that it's not a child, only a clump of cells with no rights, and that the woman should have unlimited autonomy over her body and should not be pushed into motherhood against her wishes. When a few other commenters brought up the man's rights, the clump of cells suddenly became a child with the right to parental support. The feminist commenters, who were so adamant that a pregnancy should not be a punitive consequence of sex for the woman, had no problem telling men to \"man up\" and that men shouldn't have sex if they can't deal with the consequences. \n\nFor me, this is a huge logical disconnect. Either it's a clump of cells with no rights and everybody can walk away, or it's a child with rights and everybody stays. But feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. Or as one commenter on the men's side put it, *People who would be apoplectic to hear someone say \"If she didn't want to be a mommy she should have kept her legs closed\" will happily turn around and say \"If he didn't want to be a daddy he should have kept it in his pants\" and the hypocrisy is entirely lost on them.*\n\nVersus the feminist position - \n&gt;The point of ejaculation IS WHEN MEN MAKE THEIR CHOICE.\n\nBecause condoms never break and birth control never fails. \n\nReally, go read the comments on those articles, and maybe you'll understand why MRAs - especially male MRAs - are so upset with feminism. \n\n[October 10 column](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14981168)\n\n[October 17 column](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=15029833)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are the specific laws set in place by Feminism that restrict male rights (only really heard of the ones that GIVE women rights, such as right to own land, to vote, etc not the ones that take away from men)?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little late to the party, but here&amp;#39;s one of my issues -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men having no input in the abortion discussion.

Or as one commenter on the men&amp;#39;s side put it, &lt;em&gt;People who would be apoplectic to hear someone say &amp;quot;If she didn&amp;#39;t want to be a mommy she should have kept her legs closed&amp;quot; will happily turn around and say &amp;quot;If he didn&amp;#39;t want to be a daddy he should have kept it in his pants&amp;quot; and the hypocrisy is entirely lost on them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Versus the feminist position - &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The point of ejaculation IS WHEN MEN MAKE THEIR CHOICE.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because condoms never break and birth control never fails. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, go read the comments on those articles, and maybe you&amp;#39;ll understand why MRAs - especially male MRAs - are so upset with feminism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14981168\"&gt;October 10 column&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=15029833\"&gt;October 17 column&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11tby2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/MensRights/comments/11tby2/feminist_here_with_some_questions_not_looking_to/c6pireh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11tby2/feminist_here_with_some_questions_not_looking_to/", "name": "t1_c6pireh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MensRights", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1350789239.0, "created_utc": 1350789239.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11tby2/feminist_here_with_some_questions_not_looking_to/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Feminist here with an honest question--before you bite, hear me out...", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 13, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "MensRights", "link_author": "Thermodynamo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c6kl2qq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "notscrubsjd", "num_comments": 299, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_c6kdt24", "score": 13, "author_fullname": "t2_7us76", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; When feminists stop ... stop complaining about stupid bullshit....\n\nIf you haven't read the link, you should.

It can only be reduced by treating your employees decently and building up loyalty - which is a two-way street. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTW, why do they automatically assume that people with only a bachelor&amp;#39;s or below aren&amp;#39;t also going to jump ship at the first opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: Don&amp;#39;t treat your employees like shit, and maybe they&amp;#39;ll be loyal instead of fleeing your company at the first opportunity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_x0peu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/lostgeneration/comments/x0peu/get_a_job_the_craigslist_experiment_thought/c5i9sw4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/x0peu/get_a_job_the_craigslist_experiment_thought/", "name": "t1_c5i9sw4", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lostgeneration", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1343075612.0, "created_utc": 1343075612.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/get-a-job-the-craigslist-experiment/"}}], "before": null}}
