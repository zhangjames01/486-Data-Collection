You'll change your mind if you ever get involved with someone at great cost to your well-being.\n\nI look at a dating site now and there are about 30 women who want to meet me.  I've gotten about 10 new contacts these last 2 months, none of whom I've introduced myself to before.  Most of them don't understand me.  Most of them have never had to fight for what they want, and still lose.  Nobody tries anything charismatic, half of them are missing a sense of basic social equality, half of them have no long term plans, and none of them appeal to me as anything remotely sweet or even looking for something that can be positive for 2 people.\n\nI walk into a bar and introduce myself and my friends to a bunch of girls.  One of the girls says something mean.  Society seems to expect her to do this.  I'm expected to not care.  I don't care... for people like her.\n\nA girl who introduced herself to me to grind at a club is flirting with the bouncer now after we walk outside.  How cute.  I'm supposed to find that attractive.  She smokes a cigarette.  She wants a challenge.  I play the part.  She's tagging along.  We dance.  And I feel alone.  Because she doesn't know me - she only knows what she's attracted to.\n\nI sit on the bus and this girl smiles at me.  I can tell she wants to flirt.  I don't know what I'm supposed to want from that.  I'd rather know who she is than entertain a facade.\n\nWhy in hell's name would I want to have sex with any of these assholes?\n\nDo we think that that kind of tension is lucrative or prosperous?  Or am I just going to feel like I don't know you and I'm alone while turning you on and getting fucked.  Real hot.\n\nThe truth is, it's easy to have sex.  It's easy to turn someone on.  But you can't lie to yourself about whether the person you're with actually cares.  Most girls don't.\n\nThat's why you're not having sex -- and you may not know this, but you probably wouldn't even want to with most of the people you find physically attractive.  They're too retarted to even know you're probably even a good influence.  Maybe in a way you don't even know yet.  Most of them will not make you smile.\n\nThere's a statistical correlation between women looking for long term relationships and an absence of financial stability.  I love math.  But this makes me sad.  1/4 of American women have an STD.\n\nMy rights disappear if I have sex and a girl conceives.  Her decision over mine.  I make a lot of money.  I don't want to be taken advantage of, especially if someone tries to conceive without telling me.\n\nMarriage, another loss:  A system designed to have me approach a woman with half my life's savings every time I propose.  Half a man.  Maybe common law makes more sense.

You&amp;#39;ll change your mind if you ever get involved with someone at great cost to your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I look at a dating site now and there are about 30 women who want to meet me.  I&amp;#39;ve gotten about 10 new contacts these last 2 months, none of whom I&amp;#39;ve introduced myself to before.  Most of them don&amp;#39;t understand me.  Most of them have never had to fight for what they want, and still lose.  Nobody tries anything charismatic, half of them are missing a sense of basic social equality, half of them have no long term plans, and none of them appeal to me as anything remotely sweet or even looking for something that can be positive for 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walk into a bar and introduce myself and my friends to a bunch of girls.  One of the girls says something mean.  Society seems to expect her to do this.  I&amp;#39;m expected to not care.  I don&amp;#39;t care... for people like her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A girl who introduced herself to me to grind at a club is flirting with the bouncer now after we walk outside.  How cute.  I&amp;#39;m supposed to find that attractive.  She smokes a cigarette.  She wants a challenge.  I play the part.  She&amp;#39;s tagging along.  We dance.  And I feel alone.  Because she doesn&amp;#39;t know me - she only knows what she&amp;#39;s attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sit on the bus and this girl smiles at me.  I can tell she wants to flirt.  I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m supposed to want from that.  I&amp;#39;d rather know who she is than entertain a facade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why in hell&amp;#39;s name would I want to have sex with any of these assholes?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do we think that that kind of tension is lucrative or prosperous?  Or am I just going to feel like I don&amp;#39;t know you and I&amp;#39;m alone while turning you on and getting fucked.  Real hot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is, it&amp;#39;s easy to have sex.  It&amp;#39;s easy to turn someone on.  But you can&amp;#39;t lie to yourself about whether the person you&amp;#39;re with actually cares.  Most girls don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re not having sex -- and you may not know this, but you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t even want to with most of the people you find physically attractive.  They&amp;#39;re too retarted to even know you&amp;#39;re probably even a good influence.  Maybe in a way you don&amp;#39;t even know yet.  Most of them will not make you smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a statistical correlation between women looking for long term relationships and an absence of financial stability.  I love math.  But this makes me sad.  1/4 of American women have an STD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My rights disappear if I have sex and a girl conceives.  Her decision over mine.  I make a lot of money.
