To be safe, though, I took the far right edge, incase it got hairy so I could just drive out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently everyone had that idea, because about 1/3 of the way in, I hit a deeeeep hole, and my hood almost goes under water. We scream, &amp;quot;JEEEZUSSS!!&amp;quot;, and I throw it from 2nd into 3rd and floor it. Engine&amp;#39;s screaming, huge rooster tails of mud coming out all four wheel wells, and we&amp;#39;re hollerin&amp;#39; like the world&amp;#39;s ending. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We finally climb out of the hole, shaken, dumbfounded, and then we hit one even deeper. This time, the hood &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; go under water. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I floor it again, and just repeat, &amp;quot;OH SHIT, OH SHIT, OH SHIT&amp;quot;, and in my terror, I&amp;#39;m already thinking of who I know that might be able to come pull me out of the mud, &amp;#39;cause I&amp;#39;m about to get stuck as fuck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So again, we&amp;#39;re screaming, mud and water are flying everywhere, we&amp;#39;re sunk almost to our nipples. The truck&amp;#39;s only going about 3mph, but it hasn&amp;#39;t stopped yet and apparently the engine&amp;#39;s breathing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the front axle finds a little purchase, and we shoot out of that hole like a log ride. She climbs up and out, onto solid dry ground, and we all jumped out beating our chests and screaming at the sky. A Jeep showed up out of nowhere and said they heard us screaming and had to come check. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the day the Cruiser earned my friends&amp;#39; respect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the novel&amp;#39;s worth of a mediocre story. Just hadn&amp;#39;t thought about that day in a while and felt like typing a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; I almost sunk my FJ40 in a water hole that was deeper than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4r1n6t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/4x4/comments/4r1n6t/off_road_4x4_fail/d4xxks8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/4x4/comments/4r1n6t/off_road_4x4_fail/", "name": "t1_d4xxks8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/4x4", "author_flair_text": "'74 FJ40; '97 FZJ80", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1467572610.0, "created_utc": 1467572610.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVd3zMOIlQ"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[Serious] What is your most prized possession that you own that others would look at as just junk?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d4xcin1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "mr_midnight", "num_comments": 475, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d4x69k3", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5x9c9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks.
