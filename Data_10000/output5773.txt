My sign teachers were not very educated, let alone linguists, I don&amp;#39;t remember exactly what they said, and even if I did, it was not in the English-speaking world: it would not have been &amp;quot;enactment&amp;quot;. They probably said something closer to &amp;quot;pantomime&amp;quot;, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How would you classify that linguistically,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely not language - as I said, there&amp;#39;s no grammar or lexis there, Saussure would not approve.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;and then I was like&amp;quot; and then act out some emotion or reaction rather than describing it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, very similar to that. But in non-signed speech, this is typically restricted to short segments, a single emotion or reaction, to the point you could almost classify some of those as words, with conventional meaning, as is clear from the fact that many of such reactions can be replaced by emoji (&amp;quot;he was like \ud83d\ude32&amp;quot;); you would not normally act out an almost entire action sequence, like one of the demonstrations showed. (Though, again, in real use, the mix varies.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, &amp;quot;I was driving but the rain was heavy, I couldn&amp;#39;t see very well&amp;quot; might be something like: hands in front gripping imagined wheel, slightly turning it left and right, one hand shoots forward with splayed clawed fingers moving up and down with an accompanying hiss to show heavy rain on the windshield, then acting out the wipers with a forearm, while having slouched posture, squinted eyes, worried expression, tilting head one way and another trying to see better... There might be a conventional sign here or there (e.g. &amp;quot;RAIN&amp;quot;) but in general most of this is just miming the actions that took place, unrelated to sign language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11je98x", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/linguistics/comments/11je98x/arbitrariness/jb8tspp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/11je98x/arbitrariness/", "name": "t1_jb8tspp", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linguistics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678176212.0, "created_utc": 1678176212.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/11je98x/arbitrariness/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhos", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Arbitrariness", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "linguistics", "link_author": "RNA2015", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jb4p2ey", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Amadan", "num_comments": 36, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jb30ju5", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3i9sx", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It has been a long while, and I might not hit the exact terms, but when I was learning a sign language, the instructors were very emphatic to note the distinction between signing and enactment (or mime).
