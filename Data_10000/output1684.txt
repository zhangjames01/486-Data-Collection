Also most chickens are killed with electricity so they would more than likely be dead before this.\n\n- I can't speak much for this \"grinder\" its just important to note that broiler chickens (chickens used for meat) and Laying Hens are two totally different breeds, that are radically different from each other and as such they can't be used for each other purpose\n\n- There are four images here that fall under kinda the same idea, the guy with the pitch fork, the two with calves being punched or grabbed, and the guy loading chickens (they actually look more like turkeys). Very simply this people are sadists. They do this because they enjoy torturing animals and any respectable farmer would not only fire them on the spot for actions like this there's a very good chance they would beat them to death. The animals we work with are our livelihood and an assault on them is an assault on us.\n\n- The image of the Bull being castrated isn't actually that shocking, this one is include just because of the divide between consumers and producers, judging by how calm that bulls is, it is more than likely under anesthetic. There are a couple ways that famers castrate steers, the two main ones are cutting out the nuts (shown in the gif) or castration bands. its about 50/50 as to which farms use which method. With banding its a little rubber band about the size of a cheerio, it cuts of circulation and in about 2 weeks there are no nuts to speak of. With cutting the testicles are left on till the steers are several months of age, this is done primarily to promote growth with out the use of hormone implants. They are then cut out using a scalpel and increasingly local anesthetic. On average it takes about 10 minutes for both methods before they are back doing their regular thing.\n\n- This applies to both the cow being slaughtered and the pigs near the bottom. They are dead when this happens, in slaughter plants cattle are killed with a captive bolt gun, it fires a retractable pin through the skull of the cow and severs the spinal column, they are dead instantly. Pigs are also killed this way and as far as I know they can also be killed with electricity. In both cases they are more than dead, the movement that you see in the Gif's is actually stray electrical pulses from neurons. This is also why the necks are slit right after they are killed, when the spinal column is severed the heart stops as well so the only that forces the blood out of the animal is these muscle contractions.\n\n- As far as the Cow that's having its tail cut, that's called tail docking and in dairy cattle it just doesn't happen much anymore. The cows have tails to keep flies off of them and when you take that away it actually creates more issues with disease, namely pink eye.\n\n- The \"Genetically modified\" chickens is complete bullshit. These are sick animals that need to be treated or euthanized. its an unfortunate part of working with animals that not all of them make it but we all do our best to save as many as possible. The part of this gif that is incredibly ignorant is the genetically modified part in the title. They just are not, to the best of my knowledge they have not released any sort of GMO livestock, with the exception of fish.\n\n- And lastly the images of the piglets, this is called dashing them. When done correctly it snaps their neck and they are dead instantly. Its a practice that's going to the way side because it can be pretty brutal is done incorrectly. The pig Barns I know of use primarily electricity to euthanize piglets. What also goes unmentioned in images like this is that farmers don't just go around killing baby animals for fun. The last resort is to euthanize an animal and its done because we have exhausted every means by which to save them and to let them suffer through a long drawn out death is inhumane.\n\nTl;Dr These are very extreme images that in no way represent what the industry actually practices or condones.

First off I would would like to point out a few bias's I have, I am a Canadian dairy farmer, based in Alberta. Our operation consists of a 50 head milking herd of Holstein dairy cattle (this is the average number of cattle milking at any given time, we have approximately 100 head counting heifers and dry cows), as well as 100 cow/calf pair of red and black angus beef cattle, we also put up all our own feed. We have a supply management system in place for out dairy system in Canada and as such we may have different regulatory requirements than other countries, so I would invite you to look up your local regulatory systems as they will most defiantly vary from what I work with. There are a couple threads in here that do an excellent job explains the finer points of antibiotic resistance but I will try and phrase my contribution such that the average individual will understand my points and get a broader sense of a dairy operation.\n\nFirst and foremost as a dairy farm in Canada we have incredibly strict requirements as far as antibiotics go in our milk. When out milk is picked up from our farm it is pumped into a bulk tanker, (similar to an oil tanker truck) before any is added to the tanker an individual sample is taken from each farm. When the milk is delivered to the processing plant the truck is not aloud to unload its shipment until the samples taken from each farm are individually tested for a variety of things including somatic cell count (cells present in the milk that are not the milk it's self but would originate naturally in the cow), IBC count (which can constitute individual bacteria found due to improper cleaning cycles or foreign materials drawn into the milking units), and most importantly any antibiotic traces. Again speaking for Canadian producers, should you be caught with antibiotics in your milk sample it's a very serious offence. In the event that a sample comes back positive you are fined the equivalent value of the tanker load of milk that now has to be disposed of, which can be over $20,000 Can in value, and all of the milk in the tanker is disposed of and does not go into the supply for the general populace.\n\nAs such, in Canada anyway, you are not at risk for being exposed to antibiotics in your milk supply. When we treat an animal with an antibiotic, it comes with a withdrawal date on it. There are generally two different dates (occasionally they are the same amount of time), one of the dates is for meat and the other is for milk. For the dairy aspect of our operation these dates are near religious in nature, on our farm and several of the farms I have visited there are several redundancy systems in place to prevent any contaminated milk from entering the system, including several places where it is written down which animals and when they are treated as well as physical markers such as paint or collars/tagging. \n\nAs Canadian dairy farmers we are not aloud to feed sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics to any of our lactating animals. That being said the animals we do treat with antibiotics we try to minimize as much as possible for the very simple reason it is a profit loss for us as producers. A part of our operation there are few reasons we resort to antibiotics. For the younger side we treat calves primarily for two things, the first being scours which is very similar to the flu in humans. Calves will usually receive electrolytes as they are most at risk for dying of dehydration as well as a mild antibiotic when they come down with scours. The second thing calves are most at risk or contracting is pneumonia, which is exactly the same as it would appear in humans, as such they are treated the same as a human is treated, with an antibiotic and a steroid injection to help clear the lungs of fluid. On the adult animal side we treat for two main reasons the first and most common is mastitis, this is when bacteria travels up the teat and causes an infection in the udder of a cow. This is also something that can occur in humans as well. Generally this is treated with an antibiotic that is injected into the effect udder it's self, the withdrawal times on this antibiotic are roughly 5-7 days and the cow usually makes a full recovery during which none of the milk is put into the bulk tank. Cows usually suffer no ill effects for it. The other reason for treatment tends to be hoof problems. This tends to be very dependant on the housing facility that the cattle live in, when cattle reside primarily on concrete they usually have more foot related problems. The first line of defence for such issues is a good breeding program, cattle with good feet and legs tend to fair better, the second line being hoof trimming, most farms have professionally hoof trimmers come out anywhere from every month to 6 months. Their job is very similar to trimming your fingernails, they shave away hoof to reshape it more to a proper form as well as removing pockets where bacteria can grow. The final and least ideal method, is to deal with foot rot and/or hoof problems by treating them with antibiotics, again for there very simple reason that is has a profit repercussion when producers are unable to ship milk.\n\nMy apologies for any grammatical and/or spelling errors.\n\ntl;dr: Please speak with an actual farmer before deciding things about the agriculture industry, 99% of what you hear from movies, tv, news and \"the guy your friend knows\" is complete BS or a spin story.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good evening lady&amp;#39;s and gentlemen men.
