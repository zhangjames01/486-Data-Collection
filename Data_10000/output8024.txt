It developed early on in middle school and steadily got worse throughout high school. Coincidentally, my sister has the condition as well. I pick mainly at my shoulders, sometimes my face, occasionally my chest and *very rarely* my legs around my knees. It is incredibly difficult to stop, even with treatment, and many people never do. The longest I've gone without picking was three weeks. All it takes is to be zoning out and you might subconsciously start picking at your skin and start the cycle all over again.\n\nIt has effected me in many different ways. Its made me much more self conscious about my self image. Even if I could cover my shoulders by wearing a jacket, I could never cover my face. My acne never really was severe, but it sure seemed like it because I would pick at the tiniest bumps on my face. It gave me terrible self image issues. If I ever took off my jacket or wore a tank top on a hot day, people would ask about my shoulders and I sheepishly just tell them that it was eczema. I would be so embarrassed. I felt that if I told them that it was technically a disorder, they would treat me differently, like I was crazy. So instead, I blamed it on a skin condition that had nothing to do with my mental health.\n\nIt has also strained certain relationships within my family, especially my mother. My mom has severe anger issues and has a way of bullying me, making it very difficult to deal with her in the first place. She started commenting on my shoulders and my appearance, sometimes yelling at me to \"JUST STOP PICKING!\" at the time I didn't know it was a disorder, and neither did she. This would in turn stress me out further and I would begin picking more.\n\nOne day I stumbled on a website called \"stop picking on me\" or something along those lines and it helped me alot. It explained what I was going through and helped me cope with it in a way. I tried explaining it to my mom but she didn't understand, or just didn't care to understand. It is still a source of tension between us to this day and I just want to curl up into a ball and cry when she tells me to \"just stop\". I can't.\n\nI very rarely tell people out the condition, even my closest friends. I've always been filled with anxiety, but somehow I've always managed to be strong or manage to put up a strong front. Since its a condition easily hidden, I've been able to live a fairly normal life besides being slightly socially awkward because of my anxiety issues. It helps to have someone supportive and understanding, though, I'll admit that much. My boyfriend has been a big help and he always reassures me that I'm beautiful, with or without the scars and scabs.\n\nIts not nearly as bad as some conditions but I thought it was an unusual one that alot of people don't know about.\n\nEDIT: I also wanted to mention that I show symptoms of OCD, but due to my mother, I've never been taken to a psychologist to get things figured out. Alot of people say they have OCD like its a trend and, since I have never officially been diagnosed, I was hesitant about mentioning it. (Its a little easier to self diagnose Dermatillomania than it is to self diagnose OCD.) I also developed the symptoms in middle school, experiencing unwanted visions and thoughts about pain and violence, sex, and guilt. (Extremely confusing and traumatizing for a middle schooler.) It would get so difficult to get the thoughts out of my head, sometimes I'd be screaming inside my own mind because it was so frustrating. I felt like my mind wasn't my own, I couldn't control it. I've gotten much better at managing the thoughts and it doesn't bug me as much anymore, but I'm still fairly squeamish because of it. When Black Swan came out, I was still having difficulties managing. My friend knew I was squeamish, but didn't know why and how severe it could be. I didn't know what the movie was. If I had, I would have gotten the hell out of dodge. The images and ideas from that movie scarred my mind for weeks. Every waking moment for the next two to three weeks, it was constantly there in my head and it was a huge source of stress for me because I was constantly battling my own mind. It was horrifying. I've only told one person in my entire life about this and he's one of my closest friend who also has severe issues with anxiety and some other stuff, so I feel like he understands where I'm coming from.

My grandma died from lung cancer, my dad tried to commit suicide, my sister moved out and my mom turned bat shit crazy.\n\nMy parents are divorced and we have a very small tight knit family on my mom's side. My grandma was kind of the glue that kept everyone happy and together. It also happened that my grandma was a chain smoker her entire life, until she suddenly stopped around turning 50 which was when I was very very young. There was never a time where I don't remember her needing an oxygen tank.\n\nDespite all of this, she was my favorite person in the world. My mom was a single mother raising three kids while she battled breast cancer, went to night school and went on business trips, so I often spent the night at my grandmas for weeks at a time. My mom was also very quick to anger but my grandma was always infinitely patient and I could talk to her about things I couldn't with my mom. She would pick me up from kindergarten every day and take me to Waffle House. She would take me on all her errands and always make the smallest outings into a fun adventure.\n\nSomething I never realized, but had I been older I would have figured out, was that she was constantly taking me to her doctor's appointments for lung problems. She was frequently getting tested and receiving medication but I was too young to understand the circumstances. I don't think my grandma ever told my family how frequently she was at the doctors or else they might have started asking questions, but she always brought me with her. \n\nBy the time 8th grade rolls around, my grandma had been having a difficult time walking and leaving the house. She was often unable to leave the couch for anything besides food and using the bathroom, and she even slept on the couch. I still visited her, but not nearly as frequently as I used to. My mom always said I should call my grandma and plan a visit but I never did like I should have. I didn't know any better, I was just an angsty teenager at the time. I'll never forgive myself for that. There's so many things I want to ask her to this day, there's so little I truly knew about her. And I'll never know.\n\nShe had a stroke the summer before 8th grade year starts. The doctors told us that she had terminal lung cancer even though she had quit smoking 10 years prior to that. After having cleaned out her apartment, we found pamphlets talking about cancer and making a will. We figured she knew (all the doctor's visits I had gone with her to) but never told any of us because she didn't want us to fawn over her. The women in our family have always been strong and independent. I visited my grandma a couple times in the hospital, but it was painful. She was very sick and even more so because of the stroke. She had a very difficult time communicating and they had to stick a tube down her throat. I knew I should have talked to her just about how my life was going but whenever I saw her I couldn't think of anything to say. My mom and I would sit never to her bed and just watch TV with her for an hour.\n\nI drew her a Christmas card that I was really proud of, and she wrote me a note. This was a very huge deal because she was having a very difficult time writing because of the stroke and she was always the type of person to write notes and make lists. The note said how much she loved me and how happy the card had made her, in very shaky writing. It was the last thing she ever wrote. \n\nTwo days after Christmas we were supposed to go visit my Grandma in the hospital when my mom got back from work. I was slightly optimistic, she was in a hospice but the doctors were talking about rehabilitating her so she could live out the rest of her life peacefully in her own home. I had just gotten out of the shower and was getting dressed when my mom barged into the bathroom. (I shared a bathroom with her so this wasn't uncommon but she knew how badly it annoyed me because I was shy about my young teenage body.) I practically yelled at her asking \"What?!\" and she responded with a devastated face and tears welling up in her eyes that my grandma was dead. I just responded with \"Okay!\" because I didn't have enough time to register what she had said.\n\nThen it hit me. I felt so horrible for the way I has responded. My grandma was dead. I got dressed and found my older sister in the living room where we sat and cried together. It was incredibly painful. I had lost one of the most important people in my life.\n\nDuring that year, my mom lost it. I wasn't sure what had really happened. I think she had a difficult time dealing with the death of my grandma, my sister moving out and the recession hitting. She became a completely different person. She began bullying me to the point of tears every night, and when I'd cry she would either laugh at me for being such a baby or scream at me for it. She became verbally abusive and extremely bitter. She continued to be abusive all throughout my high school years. Now that I am in college it is easier for me to handle because I'm two hours away, but she still has her bouts when I am home for break. (I was a very good child, I followed every order and went above and beyond to help around the house. I brought home straight A's and received scholarships to pay for my tuition at college. I never lied, always told the truth, I never stayed out late, I never did drugs, I never had sex. Yet she still found it appropriate to abuse me.)\n\nI always believed that my grandma would have been ashamed of the way my mother began treating me. If she was around today, I know that she would have confronted my mom and told her the way she was treating me was wildly inappropriate and she needed to get her act together. She always protected me from my mom when she was alive. \n\nI really miss her, she was an amazing woman who had to pay for making the mistake of smoking. I have often wonder if she would be proud of where I am today. The problem is that I'll never know. Ever since her death I've had horrifying nightmares about ghosts and about her. Its extremely traumatizing for someone to lose someone they care for so much.  Don't be that person. Don't put yourself or the people around you through unnecessary pain because you couldn't control the urge to smoke a cigarette. Its such a petty thing to risk your life over, its not even cool or amazing. If you really wanna do something worth risking your life for, go skydiving or something. \n\n", "edited": 1326070191.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;8th grade in middle was a terrible year for me.

It often leads to me getting on top and kind of teasing his erection by moving my hips around as I lean forward and continue kissing him before  things get really hot and heavy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_o6k14", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/sex/comments/o6k14/ladies_when_you_and_a_man_are_making_out/c3f6yrd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/o6k14/ladies_when_you_and_a_man_are_making_out/", "name": "t1_c3f6yrd", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1326057518.0, "created_utc": 1326057518.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/o6k14/ladies_when_you_and_a_man_are_making_out/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "SO is into doggie - what can a girl do while in doggie position to turn him on more?

You don't need to wash it at any certain temperature, just make sure to wash it the same as you intend to wash it in the future. (Do you normally wash laundry on cold? Go ahead and wash it on cold.) Also, you can get away with using a straight stitch but I would suggest using a zig zag stitch and keep the fabric taught as you run it through the feed dogs. This allows the fabric to stretch and breathe beyond the stitch's boundaries, whereas you wouldn't be able to with a straight stitch. It doesn't matter too much for vertical seams, but if you were to hem the shirt (horizontal seam) you would definitely notice the difference.\n\nThis is what I suggest: put the shirt on you, inside out, and see how much you'd like to take it in. You can pin it if you'd like, but I find that I have a difficult time taking off a shirt with pins in it without stabbing myself or having a few fall out. Use some chalk to mark where you'd like to take it in. Lay the shirt flat and use those marks to outline and pin where you need to sew to take it in. Sew. Try the shirt on. \n\nSometimes, if you don't do the sleeves separately, they can bunch up around the arm pits and seem very long compared to the rest of the shirt. If that's the case, then you will need to take the sleeves off and make the proper adjustments. Lay the shirt flat and mark on the shoulder seem where the sleeve should start. (You might want to put the shirt on and try it, or use an existing shirt as reference.) Draw a curved line cutting the mark you just made on the shoulder seam, connecting to the side seam you sewed in earlier. Carefully cut the sleeves off, making sure that you leave room for a seam allowance from the curved line you just drew.\n\nI'm honestly not sure if there's an easier way to do the sleeves, but this is how I've always done it. Make a quick pattern on a separate piece of paper. You will need to draw a \"t\" shape. The horizontal line of the \"t\" being the measurement around your biceps plus a couple inches for ease of movement, or depending on how fitted you want it. Also include seam allowance. The vertical line will be the measurement of how long you want the sleeve from the shoulder seam to midway down your bicep. (If the sleeve was way too long, then cut off a few inches of its original length. Otherwise, just use what you have already.) You're going to draw another line connecting the top of the vertical line with the two end points of the horizontal line. Its a little tricky, and I like to use a piece of string for this part. Take measuring tape and measure the new arm hole that you just cut out, make sure you're measuring where you'll be sewing and not the seam allowance. (A normal ruler won't work for this since its a curve and you need a very exact measurement of its length.) Cut a piece of string that is as long as that measurement. Place one end of the string at the top of the vertical line of the 't' and the other end of the string at one end point of the horizontal line of the 't'. \n\nThe string SHOULD be too long for this space so you'll need to give it a curve to fit. Curve the string so that it looks something like the top of this [sleeve pattern.](http://img12.photobucket.com/albums/v36/crafty-dame/tutorials/sleeve_step_1.jpg)Carefully trace the string and copy this to the other side of the \"t\", so that you have a symmetrical pattern. Draw the side and bottom lines to the \"t\" pattern so that it looks like that picture. Add a seam allowance around the entire pattern and cut it out. \n\nTake your sleeves and cut out the side seam, then trace this pattern, using chalk, onto the sleeves. (Its easiest to align the bottom of the pattern to the hems cuff of the sleeve then to hem it again, so I suggest doing that.) Cut off the excess material. Take a sleeve, turn it right sides together. Sew along the edge as to create the sleeve. It should resemble what it looked like after you cut it off and all that it needs now is to be pinned, right sides together, to the shirt, aligning the seams. Sew together and it should be good as new. (You can try using [this](http://www.leenas.com/English/draw_sleeve.html) drafting guide for sleeves as a reference, i basically explained this without the complicated measurements.)\n\nI know you want pictures, so if this is hard to decipher for you I am more than willing to draw up a tutorial for you in the morning if you need it!
