It might not be, but my Spidey Sense is suggesting that it is.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You work for a company.  Your company works for other companies.  The Most Important Company your business works for is doing a Thing and your business is in attendance.  The big boss of the Important Company is holding a meeting with another Important Company.  A bunch of your competitors are also in attendance.  All eyes are on the Big Boss as he chats to the Big Boss of another Important Company.  It is their first meeting.  The cameras are rolling.  Everyone will see this moment.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Big Boss stops everything.  &amp;quot;Hold on a moment,&amp;quot; he says to the other Big Boss.  He points at you and gestures that you should approach.  You walk up.  You weren&amp;#39;t supposed to do or say anything today, so you are nervous as all hell.  He says &amp;quot;you have a very nice mustache.  I bet you make Other Big Boss very happy.&amp;quot;  He gives you a big grin like he had said something clever and possibly sexual.  He sends you away.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you feel?  Did that feel good?  Do you feel complimented?  Do you think that was an appropriate thing to do?  Considering all that power and authority Big Boss has, in that crowd, do you awkward-smile and try to melt back into the crowd, without ruining your business relationship?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know in advance that the answer will be something along the lines of &amp;quot;I accept the compliment gracefully and would totally love to be objectified in front of my peers and colleagues, especially if the comment had sexual undertones and was completely inappropriate, if not in content, then at least in timing and delivery&amp;quot;.  I&amp;#39;m certain that will be the response you give.
