It&amp;#39;s very simple to get from the problem down to the root cause and the only hard part is determining when you need to keep going (you&amp;#39;re allowed to go more than 5!) and when you can stop (you&amp;#39;re allowed to stop before you get to 5!).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_o4smf9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/engineering/comments/o4smf9/question_about_root_cause_analysis/h2lftac/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/o4smf9/question_about_root_cause_analysis/", "name": "t1_h2lftac", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/engineering", "author_flair_text": "Mechanical", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1624319131.0, "created_utc": 1624319131.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/o4smf9/question_about_root_cause_analysis/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Have trouble understanding the 3D model", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "engineering", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h21oxsl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Animaniacs", "num_comments": 26, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h20h4mo", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6nxp9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's about the only thing that would make this just a bad drawing.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s about the only thing that would make this just a bad drawing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_o16m6f", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/engineering/comments/o16m6f/have_trouble_understanding_the_3d_model/h21oxsl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/o16m6f/have_trouble_understanding_the_3d_model/", "name": "t1_h21oxsl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/engineering", "author_flair_text": "Mechanical", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1623899182.0, "created_utc": 1623899182.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/o16m6f/have_trouble_understanding_the_3d_model/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qtol", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Best bars", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 8, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "iastate", "link_author": "mpr2350", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h0r6uz4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Animaniacs", "num_comments": 27, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_nt1zbt", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_6nxp9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Cellar 626 is the best experience by far.

Or you could make them all adjustable and overcome it that way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_kdcbu0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/engineering/comments/kdcbu0/align_vertical_idler_roller_bearings_and_shaft/gfx3ki5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/kdcbu0/align_vertical_idler_roller_bearings_and_shaft/", "name": "t1_gfx3ki5", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/engineering", "author_flair_text": "Mechanical", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1608039033.0, "created_utc": 1608039033.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/kdcbu0/align_vertical_idler_roller_bearings_and_shaft/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I'm starting to notice that the quality of my lowercase handwriting its quickly diminishing.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "engineering", "link_author": "StupidBeardedGiraffe", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gem4tm1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Animaniacs", "num_comments": 13, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_k6nagg", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_6nxp9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It took me way less than that to regress in my lowercase handwriting--started writing in all caps because it was best practice in my first big-boy job at a factory, and I never really let it go.\n\nI was able to revive lowercase a bit by consciously using lowercase in my own notes and such.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me way less than that to regress in my lowercase handwriting--started writing in all caps because it was best practice in my first big-boy job at a factory, and I never really let it go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to revive lowercase a bit by consciously using lowercase in my own notes and such.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_k6nagg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/engineering/comments/k6nagg/im_starting_to_notice_that_the_quality_of_my/gem4tm1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/k6nagg/im_starting_to_notice_that_the_quality_of_my/", "name": "t1_gem4tm1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/engineering", "author_flair_text": "Mechanical", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1607102962.0, "created_utc": 1607102962.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/k6nagg/im_starting_to_notice_that_the_quality_of_my/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpi", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Calculations software; I have lengthy calculations when it comes to structural analysis, the slight mistakes mean I have to change practically all my calculations.
