had a bit part in McQ). The legend was that he was on the game show $25,000 Pyramid. He and his partner got to the last stage where he would give clues and the partner/contestant would answer \"Things that are ____.\" If the partner could guess enough right answers she would win the $25,000 prize.\n\nThings are going swimmingly until they got to a clue and the conversation went like this:\n\nRoger Mosley (calm): \"Purple Suit\"\n\nContestant: \"Things that are odd?\"\n\nRoger Mosley (patient):\"Purple Suit.\"\n\nContestant: \"Things that are colorful.\"\n\nRoger Mosley (less patient): \"Purple Suit!, Purple Suit!\"\n\nContestant: \"I don't know. Ummm... Things that men wear?\" Time is now almost out.\n\nRoger Mosley (exasperated and almost yelling): \"Purple Suit!, Purple Suit! PURPLE SUIT!!\"\n\nContestant: \"I don't know, I don't know. Things that are bright?\"\n\nBuzzer sounds. The contestant doesn't win. The host comes over and decides to give the contestant a couple of clues just to see if the contestant could get the answer even though the money was lost.\n\nHost: \"A new car. A new house. A fur coat.\"\n\nContestant: \"Things that are nice?\"\n\nHost: \"Correct.\"\n\nThe host looks oddly at Roger and says: \"Purple suit?\"\n\nRoger Mosley: \"Where I come from there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.\"\n\nFast forward about ten years. The place that I work had a very successful year. Big year end party and it is made clear to me that I have to do \"something very nice for the occasion.\" So I spend about a week trying to figure out what to do. And then into my head the answer pops: \"Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.\"\n\nSo off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle. I try Nordstrom, The Bon, The Men's Wearhouse. Not only does no one have a purple suit, but they all look at my like I'm an idiot for asking.\n\nA couple nights after giving up my search and knowing that all is lost, I am rolling into the BP Gas Station right next to the Space Needle at 4AM after a Saturday night of having fun. While I am gassing up my car a guy rolls up in a big Caddy. He is wearing a gray shiny shark skin suit and has three of his \"ladies\" in the car with him. He is obviously a player.\n\nMe (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): \"Oh man I love that suit!\"\n\nPlayer (Jazz cool): \"Thanks man.\"\n\nMe: \"You wouldn't happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I've been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them.\"\n\nPlayer (Still Jazz Cool): \"Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd.\"\n\nMe: (Way too excited by the good news): \"Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it.\"\n\nThat next Monday I go down to Leroy's (La-Roy's) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say:\n\nMe (very cautiously): \"Would you happen to have a purple suit?\"\n\nLeroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): \"Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great.\"\n\nI then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit.\n\nLeroy says: \"Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player.\"\n\nThe other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.\n\nLeroy: \"No way. That would make you look gaudy.\"\n\nThe suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: \"Damn white boy! You look great!\" Without another word she drove off.\n\nI went back and bought another one two years later. I'm still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.\n\nMy friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits.\n\ntl;dr. There is nothing nicer than a purple suit. Shop at Leroy's Menswear.

He and his partner got to the last stage where he would give clues and the partner/contestant would answer &amp;quot;Things that are ____.&amp;quot; If the partner could guess enough right answers she would win the $25,000 prize.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things are going swimmingly until they got to a clue and the conversation went like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roger Mosley (calm): &amp;quot;Purple Suit&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contestant: &amp;quot;Things that are odd?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roger Mosley (patient):&amp;quot;Purple Suit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contestant: &amp;quot;Things that are colorful.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roger Mosley (less patient): &amp;quot;Purple Suit!, Purple Suit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contestant: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. Ummm... Things that men wear?&amp;quot; Time is now almost out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roger Mosley (exasperated and almost yelling): &amp;quot;Purple Suit!, Purple Suit! PURPLE SUIT!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contestant: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, I don&amp;#39;t know. Things that are bright?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buzzer sounds. The contestant doesn&amp;#39;t win. The host comes over and decides to give the contestant a couple of clues just to see if the contestant could get the answer even though the money was lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Host: &amp;quot;A new car. A new house. A fur coat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contestant: &amp;quot;Things that are nice?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Host: &amp;quot;Correct.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The host looks oddly at Roger and says: &amp;quot;Purple suit?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Roger Mosley: &amp;quot;Where I come from there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about ten years. The place that I work had a very successful year. Big year end party and it is made clear to me that I have to do &amp;quot;something very nice for the occasion.&amp;quot; So I spend about a week trying to figure out what to do. And then into my head the answer pops: &amp;quot;Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle. I try Nordstrom, The Bon, The Men&amp;#39;s Wearhouse. Not only does no one have a purple suit, but they all look at my like I&amp;#39;m an idiot for asking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple nights after giving up my search and knowing that all is lost, I am rolling into the BP Gas Station right next to the Space Needle at 4AM after a Saturday night of having fun. While I am gassing up my car a guy rolls up in a big Caddy. He is wearing a gray shiny shark skin suit and has three of his &amp;quot;ladies&amp;quot; in the car with him. He is obviously a player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): &amp;quot;Oh man I love that suit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Player (Jazz cool): &amp;quot;Thanks man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;You wouldn&amp;#39;t happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I&amp;#39;ve been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Player (Still Jazz Cool): &amp;quot;Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: (Way too excited by the good news): &amp;quot;Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That next Monday I go down to Leroy&amp;#39;s (La-Roy&amp;#39;s) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me (very cautiously): &amp;quot;Would you happen to have a purple suit?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): &amp;quot;Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leroy says: &amp;quot;Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leroy: &amp;quot;No way. That would make you look gaudy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: &amp;quot;Damn white boy! You look great!&amp;quot; Without another word she drove off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back and bought another one two years later. I&amp;#39;m still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr.

He is obviously a player.\n\nMe (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): \"Oh man I love that suit!\"\n\nPlayer (Jazz cool): \"Thanks man.\"\n\nMe: \"You wouldn't happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I've been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them.\"\n\nPlayer (Still Jazz Cool): \"Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd.\"\n\nMe: (Way too excited by the good news): \"Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it.\"\nThat next Monday I go down to Leroy's (La-Roy's) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say:\n\nMe (very cautiously): \"Would you happen to have a purple suit?\"\n\nLeroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): \"Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great.\"\n\nI then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit.\n\nLeroy says: \"Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player.\"\n\nThe other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.\n\nLeroy: \"No way. That would make you look gaudy.\"\n\nThe suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: \"Damn white boy! You look great!\" Without another word she drove off.\n\nI went back and bought another one two years later. I'm still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.\n\nMy friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits.\n\ntl;dr.

And then into my head the answer pops: &amp;quot;Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle.

The place that I work had a very successful year. Big year end party and it is made clear to me that I have to do &amp;quot;something very nice for the occasion.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I spend about a week trying to figure out what to do. And then into my head the answer pops: &amp;quot;Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle. I try Nordstrom, The Bon, The Men&amp;#39;s Wearhouse. Not only does no one have a purple suit, but they all look at my like I&amp;#39;m an idiot for asking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple nights after giving up my search and knowing that all is lost, I am rolling into the BP Gas Station right next to the Space Needle at 4AM after a Saturday night of having fun. While I am gassing up my car a guy rolls up in a big Caddy. He is wearing a gray shiny shark skin suit and has three of his &amp;quot;ladies&amp;quot; in the car with him. He is obviously a player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): &amp;quot;Oh man I love that suit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Player (Jazz cool): &amp;quot;Thanks man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;You wouldn&amp;#39;t happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I&amp;#39;ve been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Player (Still Jazz Cool): &amp;quot;Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: (Way too excited by the good news): &amp;quot;Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That next Monday I go down to Leroy&amp;#39;s (La-Roy&amp;#39;s) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me (very cautiously): &amp;quot;Would you happen to have a purple suit?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): &amp;quot;Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit. Leroy says: &amp;quot;Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leroy: &amp;quot;No way. That would make you look gaudy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: &amp;quot;Damn white boy! You look great!&amp;quot; Without another word she drove off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back and bought another one two years later. I&amp;#39;m still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr.
