(Or they might make you happy for a little while, but then you'll be right back where you started, because you need something they can't give you.) \n\n* You don't feel the need to buy things to fill the void. \n\n* You take care of your *needs* before your wants, and you're better able to distinguish between \"need\" and \"want.\"\n\n* You don't feel the need to chase after The Next Big Thing. \n\n* You don't worry about what other people will think of you. \n\n* You don't feel the need to throw out a perfectly good phone/outfit/whatever just because a new model is out, or that pattern is no longer in style, or what have you. \n\n* You don't feel the urge to visit the same old tourist traps. If you travel, you want to see something *truly* unique and special, off the beaten path. (And you don't feel the need to fly in a private jet, or even first class, when coach would be just fine.)\n\n* You value time and connection with your loved ones. \n\n* You really would rather stay in than go out clubbing on a Friday night. And even if clubbing is, for you, still within the realm of possibility, you don't do it *every* week. (And if you do, you're not buying a spot in the VIP lounge or expensive bottle service.)\n\n* You don't feel the need to \"see and be seen.\" You'd be quite content not being famous.

And you aren't yo-yo dieting, or chasing the latest fad diet, or denying yourself delicious food, either.\n\n* You're able to eat mindfully and *really enjoy* what you're eating. It's not *just* fuel, and it's not *just* a hit of dopamine. \n\n* Your relationships improve, because you're able to appreciate your partner, your friends, your family, etc. more.

To give, rather than take. \n\n* Your relationships aren't about what others can give you because you're \"empty,\" they're about what you can share because you're already full. \n\n* Your relationships are healthier, because you don't depend on them for your happiness, or validation. \n\n* You're actually feeling and sitting with your feelings, rather than trying to numb them away with drugs/alcohol/sex/food/video games/shopping/etc. \n\n* You don't feel bad about yourself (or give off \"I'm desperate!\" vibes) when you're single.
