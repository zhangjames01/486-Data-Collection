You obviously need to be careful and it sounds like you would be, in regards to not making people think you are being &amp;quot;equal&amp;quot; simply raising awareness on one side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the proposal side, either table this, or consider phrasing it as a proposal for people to engage in a day of thought considering another perspective. I think it&amp;#39;s a &lt;em&gt;touch&lt;/em&gt; difficult to do for proposal, but doesn&amp;#39;t mean you couldn&amp;#39;t craft it for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_jdcoc6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Toastmasters/comments/jdcoc6/how_to_speak_about_a_sensitive_issue/g9iigq5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Toastmasters/comments/jdcoc6/how_to_speak_about_a_sensitive_issue/", "name": "t1_g9iigq5", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Toastmasters", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1603257436.0, "created_utc": 1603257436.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Toastmasters/comments/jdcoc6/how_to_speak_about_a_sensitive_issue/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "(SERIOUS) What are some dark secrets about regular life that people should know ?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g98j1m3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "datmotoguy", "num_comments": 2794, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g98isde", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_eec87", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wait a second...", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait a second...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_jdeilu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/jdeilu/serious_what_are_some_dark_secrets_about_regular/g98j1m3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jdeilu/serious_what_are_some_dark_secrets_about_regular/", "name": "t1_g98j1m3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1603040228.0, "created_utc": 1603040228.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jdeilu/serious_what_are_some_dark_secrets_about_regular/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "(SERIOUS) What are some dark secrets about regular life that people should know ?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g98f9mm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "datmotoguy", "num_comments": 2794, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g97qenp", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_eec87", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Goes further.
