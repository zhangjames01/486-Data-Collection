You instead are demanding that I summarize it all in a reddit comment. \n\nOur homes are made out of petroleum. I will rephrase and say renewable material. \n\nOnce again, if you spent some time pursuing the education I have provided you would understand how community workshops and such would function under this system. \n\nI work in/go to school for outdoor education in Alaska, I am well aware of how to do these things. \n\nYou're generation has been crushed, and they refuse to acknowledge the new technology that will change we live. Instead they demand a return to the old ways, which were pretty shitty for a lot of people. Once again this isn't all of them, but the ones that effect our ruling/political class, which effects the rest of us. \n\nImagine if you lived a 100%  communal lifestyle, and sure maybe theres a few downsides but no one is dying in the streets, and everyone has food. Now imagine someone proposed capitalism to you. Don't you think you would have some questions about the gaps that it leaves? These gaps obviously exist or we wouldn't be in a situation like now where the wealth gap is so large, and even worse internationally. We wouldn't have whites/blacks etc pinned against each other even though they are negatively effected by the same capitalist system. A political system doesn't have to answer every question, and anarchy/direct democracy allows the individuals effected to determine the best course of action. \n\nFrom my perception it seems that information used to travel slower in human society. This meant that you learned a few things to improve your life, and then were offered a few more. Then you chilled with your kids and died. For the past 30 or so years as we entered the information age we have been finding ways to improve/tweak life both negatively and positively constantly. So unless you have kept up on this mass of technological advancement over this time period you are behind. My family that is older than me is behind, and the kids younger than I (20,s) seem to be able to process information faster because they have done it for their whole lives. I have a few hundred books on a bookshelf alongside my roommates, and we have roughly 1,000 books on a hard drive. This is more information than many humans ever had access to, and this is common place in the circles I run in. A mix of non fiction and fiction. I encourage you to consider if you are out of touch with the reality that younger generations see through technology because you are looking at it through a different lense. \n\nWealth inequality in America:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am speaking in generalities of the ruling white class that exists in our country, and the influence that they have upon the rest of us. They drive an individualistic ideology that is perversive in everything we do, including capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have linked you around a 100 hours of audio education on this topic, alongside at least many hours of reading just from one single author. You instead are demanding that I summarize it all in a reddit comment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our homes are made out of petroleum. I will rephrase and say renewable material. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, if you spent some time pursuing the education I have provided you would understand how community workshops and such would function under this system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work in/go to school for outdoor education in Alaska, I am well aware of how to do these things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re generation has been crushed, and they refuse to acknowledge the new technology that will change we live. Instead they demand a return to the old ways, which were pretty shitty for a lot of people. Once again this isn&amp;#39;t all of them, but the ones that effect our ruling/political class, which effects the rest of us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you lived a 100%  communal lifestyle, and sure maybe theres a few downsides but no one is dying in the streets, and everyone has food. Now imagine someone proposed capitalism to you. Don&amp;#39;t you think you would have some questions about the gaps that it leaves? These gaps obviously exist or we wouldn&amp;#39;t be in a situation like now where the wealth gap is so large, and even worse internationally. We wouldn&amp;#39;t have whites/blacks etc pinned against each other even though they are negatively effected by the same capitalist system. A political system doesn&amp;#39;t have to answer every question, and anarchy/direct democracy allows the individuals effected to determine the best course of action. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my perception it seems that information used to travel slower in human society. This meant that you learned a few things to improve your life, and then were offered a few more. Then you chilled with your kids and died. For the past 30 or so years as we entered the information age we have been finding ways to improve/tweak life both negatively and positively constantly. So unless you have kept up on this mass of technological advancement over this time period you are behind. My family that is older than me is behind, and the kids younger than I (20,s) seem to be able to process information faster because they have done it for their whole lives. I have a few hundred books on a bookshelf alongside my roommates, and we have roughly 1,000 books on a hard drive. This is more information than many humans ever had access to, and this is common place in the circles I run in. A mix of non fiction and fiction. I encourage you to consider if you are out of touch with the reality that younger generations see through technology because you are looking at it through a different lense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wealth inequality in America:  &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM\"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_5sling", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Shitty_Car_Mods/comments/5sling/edgy/ddi8i6t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Car_Mods/comments/5sling/edgy/", "name": "t1_ddi8i6t", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Shitty_Car_Mods", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1486592706.0, "created_utc": 1486592706.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://i.imgur.com/g33AU6W.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wfqt", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Edgy", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Shitty_Car_Mods", "link_author": "URSUSAMERICAN", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ddi5kbv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Underoath2981", "num_comments": 553, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ddi0nky", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6z96d", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "White culture is individualistic, many others are not.
