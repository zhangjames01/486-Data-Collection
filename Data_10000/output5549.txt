This is fundamentally different from the examples you provided because of the positionality of whose speech is being limited: in your examples, it was powerful institutions who unilaterally deemed what was &amp;quot;proper speech&amp;quot; and used it as a tool for oppression. In the case of &amp;quot;cancel culture,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s members of society determining that powerful people can&amp;#39;t just spew ignorance and hate, and collectively finding ways to punish that kind of speech extra-legally (calling for resignations, boycotting products, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legally, preserving the right of free speech broadly ensures that powerful organizations can&amp;#39;t target specific kinds of speech that threaten their position. But just because you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say something hateful and openly spread your beliefs like Nazism doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you should be supported and given a platform by everyone to elevate your speech.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_115bmtu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/UBreddit/comments/115bmtu/uboutcold_anti_black_history_month_instastory/j922ln7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UBreddit/comments/115bmtu/uboutcold_anti_black_history_month_instastory/", "name": "t1_j922ln7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UBreddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1676740813.0, "created_utc": 1676740813.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/115bmtu"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk95", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[OC] Avatar the Last Airbender - IMDB Scores 2023", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 36, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "link_author": "ZeusMoiragetes", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j8qu93t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Ccnitro", "num_comments": 742, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j8qq2iw", "score": 36, "author_fullname": "t2_d3oss", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't necessarily think the third solution is wrong because has no drawback, but that it quite literally *comes out of the ocean, with no lead up* in the last couple episodes.
