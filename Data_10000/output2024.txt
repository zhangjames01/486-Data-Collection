Always talked about moving back to Athens one day. We finally pulled the trigger and relocated back to Athens last Summer with our then 2 year old. We moved from a large city with lots of city stuff - restaurants, bars, museums, a zoo, too many schools to count - but we love this region and community and decided it was time for a quieter setting. We bought a house on the \"far east\" side of town - well within the city limits, but not too close to campus and all the student rentals. This neighborhood is quiet, it's full of younger families like us out walking their kids and dogs around every day. We are walking distance from a city park with a playground, skate park, community garden, city pool, and community center, as well as Sells Park which ties into miles of hiking trails in the woods. I really like it. Being able to basically hike out my front door while also being walking distance to a grocery store is pretty amazing. \n\nAlthough in the past I had always wanted to live on the West side of town up on the hill and walking distance to the Uptown area, this is where we found a home in our price range at the time we needed to buy - and it has worked out really well. I'm glad we are in a neighborhood chock full of kids for our little one to grow up with. I would also have been happy to be up on the hill near Highland Park, or on the East side closer to uptown - but we couldn't find the right house in those places when we needed it. Still, that's three areas of this small city I can think of where we could be quite happy and safe with our kiddo.\n\nThe community is great - a nice mix of Appalachian pragmatism, creatives, and academics. Town is pretty liberal and inclusive. I was worried about moving back and being one of the only non-white people in my community (it matters) and I'm pleasantly surprised by how diverse Athens is. Lots of different kinds of people here all making it work. We aren't religious, I'm a well-mannered heathen, and so far it has not mattered one bit. We weren't interested in living out in the country, always wanted to be in town.  Out in the country, if you only have a couple neighbors you never know what you're going to get. I have neighbors now who moved into town from the country after the MAGA virus infected their rural neighbors. They decided they would rather not be isolated and surrounded by that insanity. \n\nFamily activities - there are programs for kids through the community center, little league sports, that sort of thing. We are big on hiking and being outdoors and if that's what you like to do you will be quite happy! This is a beautiful place surrounded by lakes, forests, and parks. TONS of stuff to do outside within a 30 minute drive. Also there's a nice bike path in town, plenty of good city parks with playgrounds, and lots of family friendly music art and culture festivals throughout the year. Oh and the LIBRARY! The local library is legit. Books, sure, but they also have bikes, bike trailers, board games, video games, big lawn games to rent... it's great! For big city stuff, we are about 1.5 hours from Columbus and we head over there maybe once every month or two to go to the zoo or do a costco run. \n\nDaycare options are a bit tight but there are several good ones in the area. We found a small private in-home care situation run by a friend so that's working well for us. The community here is really great! Don't know about schools first-hand yet, but we were adamant about being IN Athens County so we have access to their schools. \n\nThere is a decent selection of breweries and restaurants. I will admit I miss the food scene in the big city, but Athens has some really good offerings that have weathered the Covid era and thrived. We have serviceable options for mexican, burgers, indian, thai, chinese, mediterranean. One of our favorite weekend activities is riding the bike path out to Little Fish on the other side of town for a nice couple beers and some good food.\n\nInternet is fine. I work from home full time and game casually. No issues. Spectrum. Outside of town your mileage may vary. \n\nI know this was a long one, but if you have more questions feel free to reply or DM me.

Always talked about moving back to Athens one day. We finally pulled the trigger and relocated back to Athens last Summer with our then 2 year old. We moved from a large city with lots of city stuff - restaurants, bars, museums, a zoo, too many schools to count - but we love this region and community and decided it was time for a quieter setting. We bought a house on the &amp;quot;far east&amp;quot; side of town - well within the city limits, but not too close to campus and all the student rentals. This neighborhood is quiet, it&amp;#39;s full of younger families like us out walking their kids and dogs around every day.
