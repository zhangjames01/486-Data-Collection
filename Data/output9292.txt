Standard LP epee blades tend to flick down significantly, and then momentum carries the point upwards a substantial distance. Until you break in a Leon Paul, they can be somewhat difficult beasts to handle.\n\nI bring this up because the standard StM blade, though substantially less durable (and around 40 dollars less expensive), has a blade geometry that is more standard. Even the non-fie StM epees do not travel nearly as much when used for flicks and other actions. And the StM epee's lack of durability may be a small boon, as it will acquire a pleasant bend somewhat faster than the Leon Paul (though you should have time to break the LP in, so this is probably a nonissue). \n\nPersonally, I prefer to use an StM or a BF blade. I find I have more control with them, a better feel in my fingers for the blade, and more reliable flicks. \n\nRegardless of what weapon you choose to get, I recommend bringing 3 just in case. I see more people ram into each other and get strange bends in D3 than I do in any other event type, and you don't want to risk a broken weapon in pools preventing you from presenting two weapons in DEs. It just isn't worth the stress (disclaimer: I tend to bring 4 or 5 weapons with me to most events; your mileage may vary). \n\n\n**Bell Guards**\n\nI prefer a heavier bell guard because they tend to move the balance point of the blade closer to the hand (if you're using a pistol grip). Honestly, though, I don't think the bell guard style matters much. \n\n\n**Grips**\n\nMy coach (a former olympian) had me switch grips when I started fencing with him, and I haven't looked back. His reasoning was simple: any additional target area in epee is bad. If you use a smaller grip, you tend to hide more of your hand behind the bell guard. \n\nSo my advice is to get the smallest grip you can comfortably use. If you have big hands, the Zivkovic style may be the best thing for you. If you do switch to a small grip, you will experience hand pain and cramping as you adjust to it. This is normal, but it may prove distracting. I doubt it's worth enduring said pain for the D3 nationals. \n\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nD3 and D2 nationals are completely open and tremendous fun. Just make sure you know where you're supposed to be and when you're supposed to be there. Being late will get you carded. As a corollary you probably want to take care of eating, evacuating your bowels, and all that good stuff. For snacks, I recommend [GU Energy Gel](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?rlz=1C1CHFV_enUS469US469&amp;q=gu+energy+gel&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=8679596996584646775&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CnKIT_eDGYaY0QGYwtH3CQ&amp;ved=0CLwBEPICMAk) or something similar. These things aren't as heavy on the stomach as proper food, and won't get you sick if you eat them during/between bouts. They also come in a lot of flavors, so try them out and see if they work for you. \n\nIf I recall correctly, Nationals are in California this year. This means that East Coasters will get up feeling like it's 9 or 10am (as opposed to 5 or 6am) and will likely be more energetic and awake during pools and early DEs. If you are an east coaster, enjoy it. There's nothing like knowing that all the local fencers are up early and you're not. If you aren't an east coaster, remember that the east coasters will have this advantage in the morning, so go to sleep early and eat a good breakfast. \n\nFleshing means to add weight or to make something more complete.

These things aren&amp;#39;t as heavy on the stomach as proper food, and won&amp;#39;t get you sick if you eat them during/between bouts. They also come in a lot of flavors, so try them out and see if they work for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, Nationals are in California this year. This means that East Coasters will get up feeling like it&amp;#39;s 9 or 10am (as opposed to 5 or 6am) and will likely be more energetic and awake during pools and early DEs. If you are an east coaster, enjoy it. There&amp;#39;s nothing like knowing that all the local fencers are up early and you&amp;#39;re not. If you aren&amp;#39;t an east coaster, remember that the east coasters will have this advantage in the morning, so go to sleep early and eat a good breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fleshing means to add weight or to make something more complete.

A major problem we have is that our foreign graduates do not innovate and lack initiative to strike out on their own research and projects.
