I survived freshman English class by reading and rereading &amp;quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&amp;quot; as compared to all the other junk in assigned textbook. He opened the door for New Wave SF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s an incredibly broad author in terms of different types of writing, which starts to get at the problem, namely that he often relies on a sort of &amp;quot;well, sit on down and let me spin you a tale out of the Gothic Midwest,&amp;quot; or at least a very storytelling type of mode that&amp;#39;s all ambiance, plus a sort of Twilight Zone-ish or maybe even weird fiction formula that feels eminently filmable - as it often was - but lacks weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It often feels like he was born nostalgic, which is what gives Martian Chronicles such weight in its marriage of that with science fiction, but particularly in Modern Day, with how critical we are with the past, it lacks even the sort of assimilationist diversity of his contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read The October Country recently and Bradbury starts with a personal essay that includes the writing advice to write short stories, because if you write one every day for a month, at least one out of 31 ideas will be good. I love a lot else in that forward (&amp;quot;May I Die Before My Voices&amp;quot;) but I think that is my feelings about him as a writer. His best work is the best there is, but the rest is dull, at least as writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_y0y921", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/books/comments/y0y921/ray_bradbury_any_thoughts/irxeb39/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y0y921/ray_bradbury_any_thoughts/", "name": "t1_irxeb39", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/books", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1665515889.0, "created_utc": 1665515889.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/y0y921/ray_bradbury_any_thoughts/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2swdx", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I will not stand for pro wasp propaganda.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "spiderbro", "link_author": "Cam-yee", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iq3ykq0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "pathein_mathein", "num_comments": 187, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iq1iwwu", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8dkq0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've been stung.
