That spudger is, provided you&amp;#39;re not reckless(and it&amp;#39;s pretty hard to be), what will keep you from breaking the plastic parts since from the stock photos on amazon, at least one pressure fitted joint is on the thing(again a quick google search on using a spudger and you&amp;#39;re good to go).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone to solder for you(try craigslist, just let them know ahead of time the LED and Cable you&amp;#39;d like).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yeah that&amp;#39;s honestly it. Worst case scenario you&amp;#39;d break the plastic pressure jointing while opening them up(bit of superglue will fix it), lesser worst case scenario you mess up the paint and it looks tacky or not great(just respray it, you&amp;#39;ll get better at it at the same time), last scenario and best outcome you get the look you&amp;#39;re going for.
