I know people here on LSF has always been fond of Tyler so I'm sure I'm not alone, it's been mentioned many many times how professional and polite Tyler has been outside of streaming (events and similar).\n\nSomeone else that I think would be extremely chill to hang with, that a lot of people might disagree with, but that is the \"other\" Tyler (Trainwrecks), over the past decade I must've watched him for at least a thousand hours, not including every single scuffed podcast which would add a lot more, and yes he has absolutely said so much stupid shit, like a lot, but I feel like as an adult myself, those things he's said doesn't matter how I see him, people change, people can use the wrong words, at the worst time, I simply understand that a person is more than just some words, it'd take a significant amount for me to outright cancel someone, he geninuely seems like a really good person that has far more life experiences than your typical streamer, I think that is what has made him so appealing to me, such an interesting person, and is also someone that has gotten praised at times for being very kind &amp; polite outside of streaming.\n\nClearly I've put some thought into this but there aren't many others that stand out to me like these people do, for sure Andy (Milonakis) and I would probably want to give some credit to our Paladin though, I wish I had watched more desktop streams of Jake, it's difficult to read him when he's IRL streaming non stop, feels like he's disconnected since the camera and what chat says takes priority in his mind, but he seems like a really good hearted person with a lot of life experience.\n\nI know the OTK crowd are fan favorites on LSF but the entire OTK crowd feels like a \"show\" non stop, lots of immaturity on display on and off camera, arguably top tier entertainment at times but very few genuine moments, I think the Dr. K episodes with Streamers were incredible at getting to know who some of these streamers really are.\n\nI don't think there's anyone I could mention on the opposite end, but if there are any it'd be some of the \"contestants\" on the Rajj shows, some actual filthy people to the core, most fell off but some actually made it after the exposure.\n\nI think the most amazing things that Twitch has to offer are the streamers who gather (\\*cough\\* network with) other streamers and make a show, like Rajj/Scuffed, just incredible entertainment.\n\nSo many people I have varying opinions of though, from looking through a top 100 twitch list, here's a few, I think my opinions are fairly mainstream;\n\n* &gt;!xQc - Good person but he's clearly not being his best self while streaming!&lt;\n* &gt;!Shroud -  I have no idea who this person is, one of the most boring streamers on Twitch, who happen to play FPS games 16 hours a day and is therefore extremely good at it, making people watch!&lt;\n* &gt;!Pokimane - Unbelievably disingenious!&lt;\n* &gt;!Sodapoppin - The most honest person on all of Twitch, no one else comes close, if not for the ToS he would probably be one of the tippy top streamers!&lt;\n* &gt;!Summit1G - A more entertaining Shroud!&lt;\n* &gt;!Amouranth - I do not believe a single word she says, I don't think she knows who she is herself!&lt;\n* &gt;!Ludwig - I honestly have no clue what he does on stream, yet I see him everywhere else, god of incognito networking, I think people are drawn to him naturally!&lt;\n* &gt;!Lirik - A more entertaining Summit1G!&lt;\n* &gt;!Hasan and Destiny - Both are absolute idiots, but great at the same time, one day they have the best take, the next day the worst, I just wish they hung out again, together they were unstoppable, saddest breakup on Twitch!&lt;\n* &gt;!forsen - Unironically the most boring streamer, with the most loyal fanbase, I'd have to get paid to watch!&lt;\n* &gt;!Myth - Needs to grow, look forward to seeing his content in a few years!&lt;\n* &gt;!Nmplol &amp; Malena - Best couple from an entertainment perspective!&lt;\n* &gt;!QT (Blair) &amp; Maya - Most honest female streamers and \"Wine About It\" is fantastic!&lt;\n\nTwitch sure is big, so many people, so many legendary unforgettable moments, I will never stop watching. \u2764\ufe0f", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":HYPERS:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/u4ys30rqziu71_t5_38jf0/HYPERS"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;actually most stable relationship on twitch&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have watched Twitch somewhat actively for about a decade now, feels like I&amp;#39;ve seen every top 1% streamer in some capacity, been watching the OTK crowd the most in recent years, which has spilled over to the LA crowd and so forth, anyhow, my point is I feel I &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; (as well as one can by just casually watching here and there) most of these people, and I&amp;#39;ve had this one thought many times, I guess after all of the drama thas has come and gone, that the &amp;quot;most trustworthy/dependable people&amp;quot; on all of &amp;quot;my Twitch experience&amp;quot;, is Eric and Tyler, would be my #1 people to just chill and hang out with, I feel like they are extremely stable adults and just really dependable, like I feel if I asked them to do something (work or friend related) they&amp;#39;d deliver exemplary, like you expect any stable adult to do, after having a proper upbringing.
