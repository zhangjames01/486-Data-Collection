It can only ever hurt you and can never help you.  Further, interviewers will often subtly (or not-so-subtly) pressure you to give an expectation, even going as far as implying that it's normal to give one and you're weird for refusing (it's not and you're not).\n\nConsider a situation where your expected salary is 100k (just to make things round), then a few options:\n\n1. They were planning to pay you 120k.  You tell them you expect 100k.  Now they offer you 100k and you lose out.  You'd have been much better off not telling.\n2. They were planning to pay you 80k.  You tell them you expect 100k.  Now they cancel the interview.  You are slightly worse off since you have no opportunity to interview, wow them, and convince them to pay more than they planned.\n3. They were planning to pay you 100k.  You tell them you expect 100k.  They offer you 100k.

I'd be happy to talk salary once we've decided if it's a good fit or not, since that's what's most important.\"\n* Reflect.  \"Your website says the salary is competitive.
