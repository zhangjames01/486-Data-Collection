So many people fail at this and spend too much time on the fancy stuff. I feel like you shouldn't even worry about training to failure until you can go a year without missing more than 5% of your workouts and cheating on meals or missing feeding no more than 10% (and also assuming good rest and sleep). Basically: full body workout M/W/F + eat clean &amp; eat enough protein except F/S/S evenings (eating out and going out on weekends) +  sleep 8 hours every day = pretty good beach body. It's not that much of a hassle, but doing it consistently is a challenge.\n\nLike you have to condition yourself to a point before you need to worry about \"maximizing gainzzzz!!!\" &amp; \"should I bulk or cut???\" lol. I think 80% of normies would get to a \"head turning\" level from just being consistent and slowly progressing the weights up as they get easy. The other 20% that are extreme skinny or extreme fat have to add a lot of dietary changes to get to where the normies are. \n\nAnecdotal: I was a hardgainer once upon a time, so skinny at age 20 &amp; 6'4\" I looked like Icabod Crane, all adam's apple, only 140 pounds. In college, I started with just the bar on only 3 exercises 3 times a week: squat, deadlift, bench. 3 sets of at least 8 reps, If I felt stronger than usual, I would do more reps, but not more than 12. Those were days that made me feel REALLY good. Like \"this is working!!\". I had previously tried to follow stupid workouts that were in the body building mags (per-Internet Society) and just got over-trained and discouraged. I read a magazine called [Hardgainer](https://www.hardgainer.com/magazines/) that suggested this low key but consistent approach. when I got to a point where I felt successful finally, I even quit the subscription to Hardgainer. You don't need that magazine or all the noise on the internet. You do need progressive consistency. \n\nThe slow consistency that worked for me: So, I added 1 pound to the bar each week. I went to the hardware store and found 2 half pound metal pipe fittings that could go on the bar so I could literally control adding only 1 pound a week. Deadlift and Squat I eventually started adding more than 1 pound a week based on how I felt, but always at least a pound. I then changed how much I ate, increasing protein and avoiding junk food completely till weekends. Eating more was the difficult part. Being a broke college student, I had a jar of peanut butter and protein powder (no refrigeration required) that I would eat in-between the meals I had at the campus cafeteria to help hit my protein and calorie daily goals. In one year, just being consistent, I went from weighing 140 pounds to a very good looking 210 pounds. Didn't worry about training to failure or a variety of isolating exercises. Just simple track-able progressive weight training. I think this would work for normies too. Normies and the genetically blessed could have probably progressed faster than I did initially. \n\nWish there were more studies and youtube people focusing on this. \n\nTL:DR: I  suggest videos: \"When should a beginner worry about training to failure?\" or \"Evidence of Consistency of Effort in Training.\"", "edited": 1677424177.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;consistency in effort&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So True.
