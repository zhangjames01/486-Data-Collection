This showed some wear and some embrittlement. Now, using their standard safety factors (which were below those used in the private sector), there were low odds of catastrophic failure, but the main whistle blower (forget his name, Roger maybe) wanted to use better safety standards which NASA claimed were unnecessary. Now, there were other problems with the O-rings that hadn&amp;#39;t been addressed appropriately, but the main issue with the failure was the O-ring becoming brittle at the cold temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1bsqq0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/todayilearned/comments/1bsqq0/til_it_is_believed_some_if_not_all_of_the_crew_of/c9aifhi/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1bsqq0/til_it_is_believed_some_if_not_all_of_the_crew_of/", "name": "t1_c9aifhi", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1365377199.0, "created_utc": 1365377199.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "TIL it is believed some, if not all, of the crew of the Challenger disaster survived the explosion and were instead killed when they hit the water after falling for almost 3 minutes.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "todayilearned", "link_author": "timidlikerivers", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c9ai7a7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Gondsman", "num_comments": 968, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_c99x5tj", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_50u1x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree that the standards of the time were incorrect, all I was saying was for the time, the choice fit well within their standards.
