Lies, damned lies, and statistics.\n\n****copypaste begins****\n\nThis article\n[Is Barack Obama correct that mass killings don't happen in other countries?](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-correct-mass-killings-dont-happen-oth/)\n\nVox has biased politifact's data by mostly ignoring the relevancy of **per capita** figures, and then cherry picking the per capita figure on numbers of mass shootings as opposed to what some might say really matters to the victims and their families, number of deaths. \n\nRemember that America's population is [over 320,000,000](http://www.census.gov/popclock/) and they are comparing absolute figures to places like Canada with [about 1/10 the population, 35,000,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_of_Canada)\n\nThe table in the politifact article ranks mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 as this (I rearranged order into rank)\n\nNorway 1.30\n\nFinland 0.34\n\nSwitzerland 0.17\n\nUnited States 0.15\n\nGermany 0.05\n\nUnder that very chart politifact gives lip service to the possibility that population may be a factor\n\n&gt;The chart does show that the United States has more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, partly because it has a much bigger population than all but China.\n\nThough China is not even in the chart, and they offer no population figures on other countries actually in the chart. \n\nThen politifact uses *special pleading* to ignore the per capita stats.\n\n&gt;Still, the U.S. doesn\u2019t rank No. 1. At 0.15 mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 people, the U.S. had a lower rate than Norway (1.3 per 100,000), Finland (0.34 per 100,000) and Switzerland (1.7 per 100,000). We\u2019ll note that all of these countries had one or two particularly big attacks and have relatively small populations, which have pushed up their per-capita rates.\n\nThey are saying the United States is really, really worst in mass shootings; as long as we don't count the **MASS** mass shootings, you see...  \n\nAgain, *special pleading* (or is it moving goalposts?) is a big no-no among real skeptics. For more info please consult Carl Sagan's \"Dragon in my garage\" argument.\n\nNow, those researchers (Jaclyn Schildkraut and H. Jaymi Elsass) have a book chock full of these statistics titled\n\n**Mass Shootings : Media, Myths, and Realities**\n\nWhich comes with the tag line at the top of the page on [the website selling the book.](http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A4693C) *EDIT: added link*\n\n&gt;Despite media contextualizations of mass shootings as being \"on the rise,\" the odds of becoming a victim of such an event are quite low.\n\nI don't think vox or politifact took the message to heart, or even actually read the book.\n\nAnother issue is that researchers (being honest researchers) have said \n\n&gt;their database doesn\u2019t include acts generally considered to be terrorism, such as the attack in Paris on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.\n\n(and now also the Paris attack)\n\nThey also do not include gang violence.\n\nWhether terrorism should be included or not is an interesting issue. When presented in an honest manner, it is useful to compare causes, but if the issue is arguing against gun availability itself, it's hard to understand why the motive of the mass shooting is relevant. It also encourages abuse in reclassifying certain mass shootings as \"terrorism\" or \"not terrorism\" to manipulate the data, if one wants to do that sort of thing. (i.e. If the Norway mass shooting is reclassified as \"terrorism\" because the madman seemed to be socio-politically motivated, you can change the rankings significantly)\n\nThe slide on suicides clearly shows that the US suicide rate is not much different than Germany or Switzerland. Those countries have far fewer cases of gun suicides. vox thus assumes that the problem is guns, where the data clearly shows the opposite. If people don't have guns, they *edit* ~~will~~ *can* still commit suicide at about the same rate, they will just choose other methods. The difference between gun suicide rates does not even come close to closing the small gap in net suicide.\n\n(i.e. it looks like the US has roughly 7 gun suicides and 6 non-gun suicides per 100,000; while Germany has 1 gun suicide and 11 non-gun suicides. The net difference in gun suicide rate is 5 per 100,000; but the net difference in all suicides is only 1. Anti-gun advocates imply that if there were no guns, the gun suicides would disappear, leaving the US at only 6 per 100,000, while Germany stay at 11? That is *wishful thinking*. It is a **good** wish, but perhaps programs to solve the actual root of the problem - depression - would be more effective than merely banning one of the suicide options.)\n\nAgain, this indicates that the main problem is not guns, but suicide itself. Remove any one method, and people still find other ways.\n\n*edit2; Let's be less white Anglo-centric than vox. Every single country in their suicide chart is white-majority Europe or Anglophone (a selection bias so commonly used by anti-gun advocates, I wonder if they are even aware it is a bias. Do they not know there are major non-Euro/Anglo countries that have strict gun controls that they could include in their data set?). If we still want to compare just among highly developed countries, then check the list of [suicide rates of all nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate)  we see major Asian countries with far higher suicide rates than any on the vox list, like Japan (about 18 per 100,000) and Korea (about 29 per 100,000), despite almost zero gun ownership and [extremely strict regulation of the very few private citizens who have guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation#South_Korea)* **Why does vox, when trying to claim strongly restricting guns would reduce suicides, choose NOT to include data from major advanced nations where guns are strongly restricted, but suicide rates are far, far higher?** *Again, this shows a trend to want to ignore all evidence against their claim.*\n\nI'll assume they don't present any stats on gun ownership rates vs. gun murders per capita *at the city level*. There is an argument (made dishonestly by Michael Shermer) that says U.S. gun ownership correlates with *(edit) violent crime /* gun death at the state level by including suicide data, but when we eliminate suicides (see above on how eliminating guns probably would have little effect on suicide rates) and [look at gun murder stats] LINK REMOVED BY REDDIT, *(edit) we see there is no correlation, in fact a slight but insignificant negative correlation!*, a very telling point in that claim is they do not include Washington DC as the 51st data point (note to non Americans, Washington DC is not part of any state, and is often included (or not included) in state-by-state data sets as a 51st data point. Many political advocates seem to make the decision to include DC or not based on how it affects the overall data) This is significant because it has the worst gun crime rate AND the lowest gun ownership rate at the same time. It blows the curve, and leads one to suspect that similar stats from other U.S. cities, many of which have very strict gun laws AND very high gun crime rates, would similarly disprove the claim that \"more guns = more crime\"\n\nAnd this of course all ignore the huge elephant in the room. How many lives are *saved* by people using guns in self-defense (guns are especially good as an equalizer allowing women to defend themselves from larger, stronger male attackers), or even actively stopping a shooting from turning into a \"mass shooting\"?\n\nhttp://controversialtimes.com/issues/constitutional-rights/12-times-mass-shootings-were-stopped-by-good-guys-with-guns/\n\nedit,#n *And it ignores the much bigger picture, again the bias of just focusing on nice, safe, stable Anglo democracies yields a bias I suspect the anti-gun advocates may not even be aware they have. There are many places in the world where the citizens without guns are ruled and/or murdered in the millions by tyrants with guns. If the populace had the right to bear arms, this kind of thing would undeniably be more difficult for the genocidal warlords.  A warlord group strolls into an African village and [slaughters hundreds of unarmed people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogoro_massacre)? This is not just confined to Africa and Asia. Europe had a very successful genocide program in the fairly recent past. One of the first steps of the \"final solution\" is confiscating guns from the people they would then round up, then send to \"work\" camps, then massacre. That death toll of those denied the right to self-defense dwarfs the modern \"mass shooing problem\".\n\nAgain, vox apparently thinks mass shootings don't count if they are* **mass** *mass shootings. Thousands, millions with no means to defend themselves being slaughtered throughout history to the modern day? Meh. Or maybe because some of the slaughtering was done with machetes and burning people alive, it wasn't all guns, it doesn't count? Uh huh.*\n\nIn the end, you are right to suspect bias from vox or any similar politically biased site on either side. But don't go immediately to the ad hominem. Biased sources can still lead you to the original data, and then you can make your own call based on original data. \n\nOf course, I am \"cherry picking\"  a bit myself here, but I consider it fair.

If we still want to compare just among highly developed countries, then check the list of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate\"&gt;suicide rates of all nations&lt;/a&gt;  we see major Asian countries with far higher suicide rates than any on the vox list, like Japan (about 18 per 100,000) and Korea (about 29 per 100,000), despite almost zero gun ownership and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation#South_Korea\"&gt;extremely strict regulation of the very few private citizens who have guns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Why does vox, when trying to claim strongly restricting guns would reduce suicides, choose NOT to include data from major advanced nations where guns are strongly restricted, but suicide rates are far, far higher?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Again, this shows a trend to want to ignore all evidence against their claim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll assume they don&amp;#39;t present any stats on gun ownership rates vs. gun murders per capita &lt;em&gt;at the city level&lt;/em&gt;. There is an argument (made dishonestly by Michael Shermer) that says U.S. gun ownership correlates with &lt;em&gt;(edit) violent crime /&lt;/em&gt; gun death at the state level by including suicide data, but when we eliminate suicides (see above on how eliminating guns probably would have little effect on suicide rates) and [look at gun murder stats] LINK REMOVED BY REDDIT, &lt;em&gt;(edit) we see there is no correlation, in fact a slight but insignificant negative correlation!&lt;/em&gt;, a very telling point in that claim is they do not include Washington DC as the 51st data point (note to non Americans, Washington DC is not part of any state, and is often included (or not included) in state-by-state data sets as a 51st data point. Many political advocates seem to make the decision to include DC or not based on how it affects the overall data) This is significant because it has the worst gun crime rate AND the lowest gun ownership rate at the same time. It blows the curve, and leads one to suspect that similar stats from other U.S. cities, many of which have very strict gun laws AND very high gun crime rates, would similarly disprove the claim that &amp;quot;more guns = more crime&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this of course all ignore the huge elephant in the room. How many lives are &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; by people using guns in self-defense (guns are especially good as an equalizer allowing women to defend themselves from larger, stronger male attackers), or even actively stopping a shooting from turning into a &amp;quot;mass shooting&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://controversialtimes.com/issues/constitutional-rights/12-times-mass-shootings-were-stopped-by-good-guys-with-guns/\"&gt;http://controversialtimes.com/issues/constitutional-rights/12-times-mass-shootings-were-stopped-by-good-guys-with-guns/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit,#n *And it ignores the much bigger picture, again the bias of just focusing on nice, safe, stable Anglo democracies yields a bias I suspect the anti-gun advocates may not even be aware they have. There are many places in the world where the citizens without guns are ruled and/or murdered in the millions by tyrants with guns. If the populace had the right to bear arms, this kind of thing would undeniably be more difficult for the genocidal warlords.  A warlord group strolls into an African village and &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogoro_massacre\"&gt;slaughters hundreds of unarmed people&lt;/a&gt;? This is not just confined to Africa and Asia. Europe had a very successful genocide program in the fairly recent past. One of the first steps of the &amp;quot;final solution&amp;quot; is confiscating guns from the people they would then round up, then send to &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; camps, then massacre. That death toll of those denied the right to self-defense dwarfs the modern &amp;quot;mass shooing problem&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, vox apparently thinks mass shootings don&amp;#39;t count if they are* &lt;strong&gt;mass&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;mass shootings. Thousands, millions with no means to defend themselves being slaughtered throughout history to the modern day? Meh. Or maybe because some of the slaughtering was done with machetes and burning people alive, it wasn&amp;#39;t all guns, it doesn&amp;#39;t count? Uh huh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, you are right to suspect bias from vox or any similar politically biased site on either side. But don&amp;#39;t go immediately to the ad hominem. Biased sources can still lead you to the original data, and then you can make your own call based on original data. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am &amp;quot;cherry picking&amp;quot;  a bit myself here, but I consider it fair. A quick way to prove that someone has been only picking the shiny red cherries, is to pick a bunch of dark yucky ones from the same batch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason":
