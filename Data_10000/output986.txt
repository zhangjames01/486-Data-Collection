The longer you work with another specific Worker, the easier it is to pair and unpair with that one specific worker. \n\nYou can think of it almost like reconnecting with an old sexual partner, to be blunt about it. You know the general way everything works with any partner. But with someone you've been with before, you'll be a step ahead, so to speak.

What about other psychokinesis abilities, like healing, exsist?\n\nNot as a power by itself, but it is, theoretically, something you could emulate with the right spellform.

Not on purpose, just their stuff seems to come easier to mind.\u200b\n\n&gt; What about a \"feed back\" the energy has nowhere to go, so it must return the way it came (back to the source) however it originally went, struggling to get back to where the Source pulled it from.

Might make them go boom? Or blow a limb? Or cause something mental: they lose a memory. The mental connection between the Source and Executor seems very important, affecting that would be a possible cost.\n\nSome of all of these are kind of the direction I was going.

Or possibly that it would lash out at both in *some* way, but unequally - hitting the one that shut off the connection a little harder. \n\nI also want it to depend on both the type of essence they are using - whether they are drawing physical characteristics or conceptual ones - and the Trade the Executor is using, Investment, Divestment, etc etc.\n\u200b\n\n&gt; I visualize a training session. \n\nI can totally see something like that happening. \n\nThose two examples came to mine because I was thinking about a Source and Executor where the Tool is a needle and thread and the Trade is Manipulation.

I'm not sure how much I want to reveal here, but screw it, let's go whole hog. Here we go to the real dark shit.\n\nThe reason the organization considers them an issue is because they became obsessed with the pursuit of their combat prowess and started to take pride in hunting and defeating other Workers.

A Source can see or sense all the essence around them with a bit of concentration and then can mentally \"pull\" on it, drawing it towards themselves. When they do, they allow the power to flow through or over their body and mentally *and* physically shape and mold and conjure a construct or visualization that is used as a means of purifying magical essence into Workable power. \n\nThe image is down to the Source themselves. The clearer and more realistically the Source can conjure their visualization, the more they can refine the power and the less damage they sustain while refining essence. Many Sources find it helpful to use a Tool that itself refines something or can *be* refined to help them visualize the process of refining essence with visual queues. \n\nBasic weapons and tools are something every novice worker is expected to have the ability to create. Things such as basic weapons like spears and swords; trade tools like hammers, knives, hoes, scythes, sickles, shears, etc etc etc. Literally your basic, everyday tools. A Source may choose to first create a sword as a blocky, jagged mess with pitting and chips notched throughout the blade. As they pull in more essence and refine it, the blade may become more sleek and modern in design, the blade appearing to sharpen and hone itself. Another Source may choose to have the sword appear in it's final form but as a ghostly, translucent item that starts to appear more and more real as the essence is refined further. In the case of a hammer, the Tool may spring to life fully rendered and realized and begin to beat itself against the ground or a rock or other object, the speed of the individual hammer strikes being the thing that denotes how refined the essence has become.\n\nBy the time a Source and Executor have reached a significant number of completed Tasks, Duties, and Labours they may also have created a custom Tool unique to their partnership and methods.\n\nFor instance, a musically inclined Source may make a spectral violin that becomes more ornate; a farmwoman a sickle and winnowing basket that she fills with harvested and refined essence; a tailor may form threads and a needle, or bolts of cloth, or shears, etc etc.\n\n-\n***Executor***  *(needs work, spent most of my time writing on the Sources and their Tools)*  \nExecutors dedicate themselves to a **Trade,** which is a kind of style of magic. An Executor's trade influences the types of spells they will construct and the ways they construct them. \n\nEach Executor can learn any Trade, but much like a Source will have an affinity for certain kinds of essence, an Executor will have an affinity for a specific trade. An Executor who is paired with a Source who likes to use a sword as their tool will use magic in a much different way than another Executor whose Source also favours a sword depending on the Trade they have chosen. \n\nAn Executor can attempt to switch their Trade if they would ever want to. Much like a master carpenter who decides to start doing metalwork, however, they will lose progress even if the two Trades share similar skills. Carpenters and metalworkers both need to measure well, plan thoughtfully, and cut precisely - but the actual act of cutting and shaping and joining metal is different than doing the same with wood.\n\nTrades include Investment, Divestment, Detection, Manipulation, and Consumption, and possibly more.\n\n**Investment** - using the Tool to infuse essence into an object or area to alter its properties  \n**Divestment** - using the Tool to pull the essence out of an object or area to alter its properties  \n**Detection** - using the Tool in a way that allows an Executor to see and understand the essence used, and construction of, a spell effect  \n**Manipulation** - using the Tool as the type of physical object it is, often with enhanced or wondrous capabilities  \n**Consumption** -  using the Tool more like a battery or fuel tank to enhance and ensorcell themselves\n\n***\n\n-\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-\n\n***\n\n##Working, visualized\n\n***Ribbons of Light***  \nDrawing essence in creates a connection between the Source and the object it is being drawn from. The world of Onos is very flat-toned with lots of drab tan, olive, and green colouration. When a Source draws on essence, a streamer of visual light will start to form and flow towards the Source and Tool.

Thanks for the interest. And helping me take my mind off stuff. Reply 1 of 2 here:\n\n&gt; You mentioned your world is high fantasy. Have you considered creating a color palette for how you imagine your society? Or a mood board? If no, you may want to try that and use it as a reference, a tether for your brain to build off of.\n\nNot really, honestly. Thank you for the idea. The concept of a colour palette never really occurred to me honestly until last year when I read Mistborn. In my head, at this point, I was just picturing normal colours but that isn't quite right. If I had to put something to it right now, a kind of drab olive green and tan overall. Think original Matrix in colour, but medieval-esque in style.\n\n&gt; What clothing might an everyday civilian wear?\n\nDepends on where they live. But woolen and leather tunics, leggings, vests, robes, etc etc. Standard high fantasy fare but maybe with a little more care for tailoring. In the cities you'll find even commoners dressed a little more carefully with well fitting shirts and pants and leggings and multiple sets of outfits that are put together with purpose according to the latest trends.\n\n&gt; What energies does your world run on: electric, steam, magic, none, other?\n\nMagic and elbow grease, for now. I'm actually not to keen on a world with only one source of magic so there may be another I introduce that I build on top of, intersect with, make in opposition to, or have *entirely* separate from the magic of Working. But I don't have it, yet.\n\n&gt; Are workers naturally occurring or are they selected? How do they become paired?\n\nYes. The pairing is just a matter of training and familiarity. Any Source can work with any Executor, though there is a measure of intent necessary where their powers intersect. A Source and Executor work together when the refined power is handed over and shaped into the actual spell of effect the Executor creates. A Source can refine power and decide not to hand it over, or be rendered incapable of doing so, such as by being killed while actively Working. \n\n&gt; Can workers be unpaired? Why/why not, how?\n\nKind of. Dropping a pairing is something that takes just a moment of concentration. Creating a Working bond takes quite a bit more concentration and concerted mental effort, except in the case of Workers with extreme familiarity. And no matter the level of familiarity, creating a bond is always a two-party consent system - an Executor can't force a Source to use them or vice-versa. \n\nDropping a pairing is something either of the Workers can do. With this and the ability for either to terminate the connection during the actual use of magic, no Worker should ever be forced to take part in Work they do not agree with. I haven't decided if it takes an actual ritual or just a few minutes or concentration, or if it needs physical contact, or anything else, yet. \n\nBeyond those few minutes it's comparable to being well versed in a sport, game, or hobby with a high level of mastery - but not playing for a while. You will no doubt be able to grasp and use the basics within minutes, but it will be a while of use and practice before you really shake the rust off. For this reason, most workers try to maintain long Working partnerships, the setback in power and ability often isn't worth changing partners.\n\n&gt; Is this a platonic pairing, more? what is it that makes the pair work together?\n\nIt is only ever meant to be platonic, though there are absolutely no rules against starting a romantic or sexual relationship with your partner. It happens about the same rate you would expect to see other couples in the same field. Though overall there are less Workers than normal citizens, so obviously there are less romantic pairs of Workers.\n\nAs for what makes them work together, is just mutual will and intent. I haven't designed the entire \"spell\" system, if you will. But a Source and Executor can read the other's intent. A Source draws in the power and starts to refine it, and binds the power in a way that it can be shaped and used, they hold concentration on that as they hand the power over. An Executor takes the refined essence and shapes it into the spell effect they want and then releases it as a completed spell. The Source and Executor both maintain their focus until the spell's effect is complete. If at any point, either sever the connection, the power of the spell is cut off. What that actually means, I haven't decided yet. But it's ***bad.*** Another cost of magic.\n\nThis mental connection, it's what allows the Source to know what kind of essence they need to be drawing on and refining so the Executor can produce their desired effect. It lets an Executor know if a Source is actively drawing essence, whether they have it refined and ready to use. \n\nAnd of course, the most important part. It lets them Work the power together.\n\n&gt; Are sources/Executors born with their abilities?\nYes.\n\n&gt; Around what age do they get/realize their powers?  \n\nThere's no outward sign. You can be tested for the aptitude if it's something you're interested in. I haven't decided how many have the aptitude, but it's enough that as long as volunteers keep coming in about the same numbers, things should... hehe... Work out. I have plans for things around possible ages and what they could mean for a Source or Executor and their abilities.\n\nBut the loss of sense of self, the thankless and dangerous tasks, and the legends that Working turns you into a monster don't help recruitment so there isn't a huge waiting list to get in. (Haven't decided if the general populace know about the the inner... *Workings* of magic. (I swear I'll stop.)\n\n&gt; What are some bad things that a worker might get away with that a citizen might not?\n\nMurder. Well, I mean, in the way that police and military 'get away' with it. As I mentioned, they are set out to handle the dangerous requests. Sometimes those threats are not monstrous, but human in nature. And if they won't stop or submit to the legal system, Workers are charged with completing their Tasks, Duties, and Labours *without fail.*", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey!

In my head, at this point, I was just picturing normal colours but that isn&amp;#39;t quite right. If I had to put something to it right now, a kind of drab olive green and tan overall. Think original Matrix in colour, but medieval-esque in style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What clothing might an everyday civilian wear?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depends on where they live. But woolen and leather tunics, leggings, vests, robes, etc etc. Standard high fantasy fare but maybe with a little more care for tailoring. In the cities you&amp;#39;ll find even commoners dressed a little more carefully with well fitting shirts and pants and leggings and multiple sets of outfits that are put together with purpose according to the latest trends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What energies does your world run on: electric, steam, magic, none, other?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Magic and elbow grease, for now. I&amp;#39;m actually not to keen on a world with only one source of magic so there may be another I introduce that I build on top of, intersect with, make in opposition to, or have &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; separate from the magic of Working. But I don&amp;#39;t have it, yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are workers naturally occurring or are they selected? How do they become paired?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes. The pairing is just a matter of training and familiarity. Any Source can work with any Executor, though there is a measure of intent necessary where their powers intersect. A Source and Executor work together when the refined power is handed over and shaped into the actual spell of effect the Executor creates. A Source can refine power and decide not to hand it over, or be rendered incapable of doing so, such as by being killed while actively Working. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can workers be unpaired? Why/why not, how?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of. Dropping a pairing is something that takes just a moment of concentration. Creating a Working bond takes quite a bit more concentration and concerted mental effort, except in the case of Workers with extreme familiarity. And no matter the level of familiarity, creating a bond is always a two-party consent system - an Executor can&amp;#39;t force a Source to use them or vice-versa. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dropping a pairing is something either of the Workers can do. With this and the ability for either to terminate the connection during the actual use of magic, no Worker should ever be forced to take part in Work they do not agree with. I haven&amp;#39;t decided if it takes an actual ritual or just a few minutes or concentration, or if it needs physical contact, or anything else, yet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond those few minutes it&amp;#39;s comparable to being well versed in a sport, game, or hobby with a high level of mastery - but not playing for a while. You will no doubt be able to grasp and use the basics within minutes, but it will be a while of use and practice before you really shake the rust off. For this reason, most workers try to maintain long Working partnerships, the setback in power and ability often isn&amp;#39;t worth changing partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is this a platonic pairing, more? what is it that makes the pair work together?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is only ever meant to be platonic, though there are absolutely no rules against starting a romantic or sexual relationship with your partner. It happens about the same rate you would expect to see other couples in the same field. Though overall there are less Workers than normal citizens, so obviously there are less romantic pairs of Workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for what makes them work together, is just mutual will and intent. I haven&amp;#39;t designed the entire &amp;quot;spell&amp;quot; system, if you will. But a Source and Executor can read the other&amp;#39;s intent. A Source draws in the power and starts to refine it, and binds the power in a way that it can be shaped and used, they hold concentration on that as they hand the power over. An Executor takes the refined essence and shapes it into the spell effect they want and then releases it as a completed spell. The Source and Executor both maintain their focus until the spell&amp;#39;s effect is complete. If at any point, either sever the connection, the power of the spell is cut off. What that actually means, I haven&amp;#39;t decided yet. But it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Another cost of magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This mental connection, it&amp;#39;s what allows the Source to know what kind of essence they need to be drawing on and refining so the Executor can produce their desired effect. It lets an Executor know if a Source is actively drawing essence, whether they have it refined and ready to use. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, the most important part. It lets them Work the power together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are sources/Executors born with their abilities?\nYes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around what age do they get/realize their powers?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no outward sign. You can be tested for the aptitude if it&amp;#39;s something you&amp;#39;re interested in. I haven&amp;#39;t decided how many have the aptitude, but it&amp;#39;s enough that as long as volunteers keep coming in about the same numbers, things should... hehe... Work out. I have plans for things around possible ages and what they could mean for a Source or Executor and their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the loss of sense of self, the thankless and dangerous tasks, and the legends that Working turns you into a monster don&amp;#39;t help recruitment so there isn&amp;#39;t a huge waiting list to get in. (Haven&amp;#39;t decided if the general populace know about the the inner... &lt;em&gt;Workings&lt;/em&gt; of magic. (I swear I&amp;#39;ll stop.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What are some bad things that a worker might get away with that a citizen might not?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Murder. Well, I mean, in the way that police and military &amp;#39;get away&amp;#39; with it. As I mentioned, they are set out to handle the dangerous requests. Sometimes those threats are not monstrous, but human in nature. And if they won&amp;#39;t stop or submit to the legal system, Workers are charged with completing their Tasks, Duties, and Labours &lt;em&gt;without fail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_i3qo1a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/worldbuilding/comments/i3qo1a/therapy_homework_the_magic_of_workers_from_the/g0e4dex/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/i3qo1a/therapy_homework_the_magic_of_workers_from_the/", "name": "t1_g0e4dex", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldbuilding", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1596585678.0, "created_utc": 1596585678.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/i3qo1a/therapy_homework_the_magic_of_workers_from_the/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcvg", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Nothing special, just some burgers from tonight", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "grilling", "link_author": "shiningmidnight", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g0bkvo5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "shiningmidnight", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g0ac06d", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_89f1f", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Great grill.

They can attune to and then use it to buff and heal the party up and then give it back, you can re-attune and start cancelling spells again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slippers of Spider Climbing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can be really fun as a way for a melee party member to engage with airborne enemies if the room/cave/whatever dimensions work out. Plus gives out of combat utility for exploration. Could even use it to win bar bets if you play the typical hard-drinkin&amp;#39;, hard-fightin&amp;#39; barbarian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decanter of Endless Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; gives you something to do with your bonus action if you aren&amp;#39;t a berserker. It&amp;#39;s only a DC 13 Strength Save, but if you have nothing else to do, it&amp;#39;s better than nothing. The 1d4 isn&amp;#39;t much to shake a stick at, but do it first just in case you get the prone and then free advantage! Plus if you have someone in the party with &lt;em&gt;Shape Water&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Control Water&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;re giving them ammo. (Also &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good against &lt;strong&gt;Fire Elementals&lt;/strong&gt; not that you can really control how often you see those... unless you can wrangle the party into visiting the Elemental Plane of Fire to test out the decanter...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will never not recommend a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robe of Useful Items&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; but something I do is let ti be pretty much any object or piece of equipment instead of just a robe. What&amp;#39;s important are that there are depictions of objects that can become real. My favourite was a shield embossed with a scene depicting a battle at a castle wall in the steel. Ladders, ropes, daggers, even some dogs that were in the scene were golden instead, and those were the &amp;quot;patches.&amp;quot; You could do the same with a painting, a carved walking stick, a storybook, etc etc etc. You can get weapons, doors and windows that can let you gain access to otherwise inaccessible rooms, a couple &lt;strong&gt;Mastiff&lt;/strong&gt; buddies. Lots of ways to be creative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helm of Brilliance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; nets you fire resistance, some spellcasting (not the primary attraction here but neat all the same), and the super sweet ability to set your weapon on fire for +1d6 fire damage at will as long as there&amp;#39;s one fire opal in it). There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a slight chance of you exploding, but you&amp;#39;ll &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_hz71iz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/dndnext/comments/hz71iz/what_are_some_good_magic_items_for_barbarians_who/fzi933w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hz71iz/what_are_some_good_magic_items_for_barbarians_who/", "name": "t1_fzi933w", "author_flair_template_id": "42943684-2ac7-11e4-839b-12313d1486b5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dndnext", "author_flair_text": "DM, Roller of Fates", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595939816.0, "created_utc": 1595939816.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hz71iz/what_are_some_good_magic_items_for_barbarians_who/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r9ei", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What house rules do you hate?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DnD", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fzfoiar", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "shiningmidnight", "num_comments": 50, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fzeqjrb", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_89f1f", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "See if I was that DM and I was gonna do something like that I would have just made it so you get two cards.
