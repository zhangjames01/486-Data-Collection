I was actually hoping someone knowledgable like you would\nrespond :)\n\nFirst up, you're spot on about my lack of knowledge regarding generative work.\nMy background is almost exclusively functional, with only a brief treatment of\ngenerative theory in my semantics and syntax classes (basically, 'This is what\nthose silly generativists believe. This is why they're wrong.'). For this\nreason, I prefaced my criticism with 'what I understand to be'. I am well aware\nthat what I understand generative documentation to be and what it actually is\nare probably two entirely separate things. I should've clarified that more.\n\nSecond, compiling a list of unusable generative articles and grammars is not\nsomething I've had the foresight to do, so I can't cite any specific works\noffhand that I consider especially unportable. If I weren't on vacation, I\ncould go through the library and pull some out, but I'm several thousand miles\naway. Even if I were home, however, I have better things to do than get into an\nanonymous bibliographic pissing match on reddit. You are no doubt much better\ninformed of generative linguistics than I am. Perhaps you could recommend a\ngrammar or two that you consider especially well written, and I'll try to read them when\nI get home?\n\nThat being said, my criticism in the previous post stems from research on\npapers I did for my syntax and morphology classes last year: the least useful\ngrammars, almost exclusively, were always ones that included in depth\ngenerative analyses. No doubt this is a result of three things: (1) my\nprofessors anti-generative bias bleeding over into the nature of the\nassignments; (2) my own ignorance of generative theories; and (3) the nature of\ngenerative work in general. Let's focus on the latter two.\n\nLike I said above, I am definitely not up to speed on generative theories. As a\nresult, when I approach a generative work, I have two things working against\nme: a lack of familiarity with the material, and an implicit bias against its\ntheoretical background.  Doubtlessly, these factors combine into a cognitive\nbias that makes me view all generative work as unportable and jargon laden.\n\nBut, really, you're kidding yourself if you think that generative work does a\ngreat job of being portable. The Chomskian writing style and predeliction for\nobtuse naming conventions (X-bar, C-command, Theta roles, Q-float, etc.) make\nit difficult for those of us with a non-generative background to easily understand\nwhat's going on in the literature. You yourself stated that 'to understand what\nfieldworkers from generative grammar are talking about, you need to spend a\nsemester or two learning something about the ideas they are exploring'. From\nthe standpoint of scientific and theoretical portability, that isn't very portable.\n\n'But wait,' you might say, 'isn't the burden of understanding on you, the\nresearcher?' Indeed, it is: I *do* have an obligation to try and understand\nwhat's going on in the generative literature before I dismiss it out of hand.\nIt really is 'intellectual laziness' if I don't make some attempt to understand\nthe literature.\n\nAt the same time, though, I think that generative documentarians, if they truly\ncare about documenting a language for posterity, have an obligation to make\ntheir work as approachable as possible to as many people as possible --\nregardless of their background in generative linguists. That is, reading a\ngenerative grammar or article -- insofar as it is meant primarily to document\n-- should *not* require (half) a year of generative classes to understand. Of course,\nif you're writing an article directed towards other generative linguists about\na specific feature, go wild with all the syntactic trees and null morphemes\nthat you want.\n\nMy own opinion (following e.g. Haspelmath, as cited by murtly) is that\nwhen writing a grammar, you should aim to make it as self-contained as\npossible, so that any motivated researcher (academic or not) would be able to\nunderstand the concepts within it 10, 20, or even 100 years in the future,\nregardless of their familiarity with any particular school of linguistic\nthought. In other words, because theories change constantly, future-proof\ngrammars should be as atheoretical and self-contained as possible, and not\noriented towards the theory du jour. They should contain enough raw data that\nany researcher in the future would be able to investigate theory Y, even if the\noriginal author subscribed to theory X. (Cf. the usage of Brahe's data in affirming\nKepler's theory of planetary motion.) This is why I prefer broad 'superficial'\ndescriptions that contain tons of raw data to divided-and-conquered narrow ones.\n\nThis issue of theoretical neutrality is closely related to methodology. That\nis, generative linguists go into a documentation environment presupposing that\nthey will find universal structural tendencies in the target language.  These\npresuppositions obviously affect the research questions and methods that are\nused to elicit data, which in turn affects the data that is produced.  You\nwould be naive to think otherwise. Obviously, functional linguists are not\natheoretical researchers, either; even Dryer's BLT is not without its\npresuppositions. The difference, however, is that generativists intend to find\nuniversal *structures*, which they inevitably do (excepting Everett, of\ncourse), whereas functionalists find universal *functions* of language. The\nlatter do not generally require the positing of arcane grammatical structures\nwith questionable psychological reality (abuse of null morphemes comes to\nmind), and do not presuppose anything about the structure -- underlying or\nsurface -- of the language. From both a philosophical and documentary\nperspective, presupposing underlying universal functions is less egregious to\nme than presupposing underlying universal structures. But, again, I'm biased as\na result of my background.\n\nMoving on, this methodological issue leads to my problem with a reliance on\ngrammaticaly judgments. Notice I say 'a reliance'. I am not opposed to them\noutright, because -- as you demonstrated -- they have an important role to play\nin documenting unfamiliar languages. I am well aware of and have encountered\nthe limitations of corpus-based linguistics. These limitations, however, do not\nimply that grammaticality judgments are the panacea that generativists appear\n(to me) to think they are. \n\nFor example, native speakers often have faulty intuitions about how\nconstructions are used pragmatically. That's not to say we have faulty intuitions about what\nare 'grammatical' and 'ungrammatical' sentences, only that our acceptance of\nthe grammaticality of a sentence is largely contextual. When divorced from\ncontext, e.g. in grammaticality judgments, a speaker may therefore accept a\nsentence that they would never actually accept or produce within the targeted\ncontext. Such mismatches are most apparent when looking at phonological\nphenomena (such as sentence final /n/ vs /\u014b/ in English), but are also apparent\nin discourse-level constructs. For example, when expressing transitive ideas,\nspeakers in many languages prefer using two-clause constructions that allow for\na pronominal agent ('There was a boy. He chased the dog'), rather than using a\nsingle clause with two lexical arguments. Just because 'The boy chased the\ndog' is a 'grammatical' sentence does *not* mean that it is grammatical in all\ndiscourse situations. Grammaticality judgments alone would fail to capture this\ndistinction. (Of course, you can always squirt this problem over to\npragmatics. I would obviously disagree with you that syntax and pragmatics are separate, but that's an issue for\nanother time.)\n\nAnother problem arises when you consider prescriptive attitudes and the effect\nthey have on speaker-reported grammaticality. In English, for instance, if you\nask people whether a sentence with negative concord is grammatical, they're\nlikely to reject it, even if they use it in their own dialect.\n\nAgain, I am not arguing that grammaticality judgments should be altogether\noutlawed as a documentation tool, only that a reliance on sentence elicitations\nwith various (un)grammatical permutations should not be the primary method of\ndocumenting a language. To my understanding, this is the primary method of\ngenerative documentation. I am probably wrong about this, on account of an\nacute case of 'turfitis', and would love some clarification.\n\n&gt; Which is why, I guess, much of the best, most useful work on language\ndocumentation is being done by generative grammarians (like the ones in the\nvideo).\n\nUseful, of course, is a relative term ;)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the great response! I was actually hoping someone knowledgable like you would\nrespond :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First up, you&amp;#39;re spot on about my lack of knowledge regarding generative work.\nMy background is almost exclusively functional, with only a brief treatment of\ngenerative theory in my semantics and syntax classes (basically, &amp;#39;This is what\nthose silly generativists believe. This is why they&amp;#39;re wrong.&amp;#39;). For this\nreason, I prefaced my criticism with &amp;#39;what I understand to be&amp;#39;. I am well aware\nthat what I understand generative documentation to be and what it actually is\nare probably two entirely separate things. I should&amp;#39;ve clarified that more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, compiling a list of unusable generative articles and grammars is not\nsomething I&amp;#39;ve had the foresight to do, so I can&amp;#39;t cite any specific works\noffhand that I consider especially unportable. If I weren&amp;#39;t on vacation, I\ncould go through the library and pull some out, but I&amp;#39;m several thousand miles\naway. Even if I were home, however, I have better things to do than get into an\nanonymous bibliographic pissing match on reddit. You are no doubt much better\ninformed of generative linguistics than I am. Perhaps you could recommend a\ngrammar or two that you consider especially well written, and I&amp;#39;ll try to read them when\nI get home?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, my criticism in the previous post stems from research on\npapers I did for my syntax and morphology classes last year: the least useful\ngrammars, almost exclusively, were always ones that included in depth\ngenerative analyses. No doubt this is a result of three things: (1) my\nprofessors anti-generative bias bleeding over into the nature of the\nassignments; (2) my own ignorance of generative theories; and (3) the nature of\ngenerative work in general. Let&amp;#39;s focus on the latter two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I said above, I am definitely not up to speed on generative theories. As a\nresult, when I approach a generative work, I have two things working against\nme: a lack of familiarity with the material, and an implicit bias against its\ntheoretical background.  Doubtlessly, these factors combine into a cognitive\nbias that makes me view all generative work as unportable and jargon laden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, really, you&amp;#39;re kidding yourself if you think that generative work does a\ngreat job of being portable. The Chomskian writing style and predeliction for\nobtuse naming conventions (X-bar, C-command, Theta roles, Q-float, etc.) make\nit difficult for those of us with a non-generative background to easily understand\nwhat&amp;#39;s going on in the literature. You yourself stated that &amp;#39;to understand what\nfieldworkers from generative grammar are talking about, you need to spend a\nsemester or two learning something about the ideas they are exploring&amp;#39;. From\nthe standpoint of scientific and theoretical portability, that isn&amp;#39;t very portable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;But wait,&amp;#39; you might say, &amp;#39;isn&amp;#39;t the burden of understanding on you, the\nresearcher?&amp;#39; Indeed, it is: I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have an obligation to try and understand\nwhat&amp;#39;s going on in the generative literature before I dismiss it out of hand.\nIt really is &amp;#39;intellectual laziness&amp;#39; if I don&amp;#39;t make some attempt to understand\nthe literature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, though, I think that generative documentarians, if they truly\ncare about documenting a language for posterity, have an obligation to make\ntheir work as approachable as possible to as many people as possible --\nregardless of their background in generative linguists. That is, reading a\ngenerative grammar or article -- insofar as it is meant primarily to document\n-- should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require (half) a year of generative classes to understand. Of course,\nif you&amp;#39;re writing an article directed towards other generative linguists about\na specific feature, go wild with all the syntactic trees and null morphemes\nthat you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My own opinion (following e.g. Haspelmath, as cited by murtly) is that\nwhen writing a grammar, you should aim to make it as self-contained as\npossible, so that any motivated researcher (academic or not) would be able to\nunderstand the concepts within it 10, 20, or even 100 years in the future,\nregardless of their familiarity with any particular school of linguistic\nthought. In other words, because theories change constantly, future-proof\ngrammars should be as atheoretical and self-contained as possible, and not\noriented towards the theory du jour. They should contain enough raw data that\nany researcher in the future would be able to investigate theory Y, even if the\noriginal author subscribed to theory X. (Cf. the usage of Brahe&amp;#39;s data in affirming\nKepler&amp;#39;s theory of planetary motion.) This is why I prefer broad &amp;#39;superficial&amp;#39;\ndescriptions that contain tons of raw data to divided-and-conquered narrow ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This issue of theoretical neutrality is closely related to methodology. That\nis, generative linguists go into a documentation environment presupposing that\nthey will find universal structural tendencies in the target language.  These\npresuppositions obviously affect the research questions and methods that are\nused to elicit data, which in turn affects the data that is produced.  You\nwould be naive to think otherwise. Obviously, functional linguists are not\natheoretical researchers, either; even Dryer&amp;#39;s BLT is not without its\npresuppositions. The difference, however, is that generativists intend to find\nuniversal &lt;em&gt;structures&lt;/em&gt;, which they inevitably do (excepting Everett, of\ncourse), whereas functionalists find universal &lt;em&gt;functions&lt;/em&gt; of language. The\nlatter do not generally require the positing of arcane grammatical structures\nwith questionable psychological reality (abuse of null morphemes comes to\nmind), and do not presuppose anything about the structure -- underlying or\nsurface -- of the language. From both a philosophical and documentary\nperspective, presupposing underlying universal functions is less egregious to\nme than presupposing underlying universal structures. But, again, I&amp;#39;m biased as\na result of my background.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moving on, this methodological issue leads to my problem with a reliance on\ngrammaticaly judgments. Notice I say &amp;#39;a reliance&amp;#39;. I am not opposed to them\noutright, because -- as you demonstrated -- they have an important role to play\nin documenting unfamiliar languages. I am well aware of and have encountered\nthe limitations of corpus-based linguistics. These limitations, however, do not\nimply that grammaticality judgments are the panacea that generativists appear\n(to me) to think they are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, native speakers often have faulty intuitions about how\nconstructions are used pragmatically. That&amp;#39;s not to say we have faulty intuitions about what\nare &amp;#39;grammatical&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;ungrammatical&amp;#39; sentences, only that our acceptance of\nthe grammaticality of a sentence is largely contextual.
