I never get in peoples faces, I don&amp;#39;t cause drama and I always walk away or avoid conflict.  Cause I know that being anything close to the instigator in any conflict that ends up with drawing my gun and using it leads to questions about true self defense or not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heck I&amp;#39;ve had to draw my gun once.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I live in a rough neighborhood (over 100 episodes of cops were filmed around here in the early 90&amp;#39;s) As I am getting home there is some drunk teen wandering around the street near my driveway.   I should have driven around and waited till he walked by but it was late and wanted to get home my dads funeral service was the next day and I had a lot on my mind.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pull in to the driveway me and the ex-girlfriend wait a moment before getting out hoping the kid wanders off, but the kid walks upto my window and asks to borrow my phone.  I politely decline and he starts screaming at me that I&amp;#39;m racists screaming white power at me and he&amp;#39;s gonna come back and shoot me.  He starts walking down the road still screaming at me.   We finally get out of the car when hes a block down the road.  As we are unloading next thing I know he&amp;#39;s got a car and is speeding towards us window down and something pointing out the window.   I draw my gun and before I take a shot I noticed its just a wrench right as he throws it at my ex&amp;#39;s camaro and busts a taillight.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I held my fire, called the cops.   The local officer assigned to the neighborhood calls me back, I send him the camera videos I have on my house of the whole thing.   Turns out he&amp;#39;s a shitbag kid who lives a few blocks down and the cop knows all about him and went to talk to his parents.   A couple days later the cop called me back said the kid was arrested on some other charges and asks if I wanna pursue my complaint.  I told him nah the kid is already fucked for life as it is don&amp;#39;t need to compound it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10pgw4p", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PublicFreakout/comments/10pgw4p/man_shoots_kills_unarmed_neighbor_for_speeding/j6l6hmh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/10pgw4p/man_shoots_kills_unarmed_neighbor_for_speeding/", "name": "t1_j6l6hmh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PublicFreakout", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675132630.0, "created_utc": 1675132630.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://v.redd.it/xpk3h3dcg9fa1"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Man Shoots &amp; Kills unarmed neighbor for speeding down street, claims he is the victim when police arrive", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "link_author": "freshjiive", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6l377t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "avengere", "num_comments": 5745, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j6l25pi", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_76j1r", "over_18": true, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "For the civil case his home owners would definitely defend him and pay out the wrongful death suit.

(based on the Progressive and Geico Landlord policy pages and FAQ&amp;#39;s).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upon further review I have found this page which discusses Rent Guarantee programs. \n  &lt;a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rent-guarantee-insurance.asp\"&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rent-guarantee-insurance.asp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a landlord myself who manages about 10 properties for myself and other family members I just couldnt justify it.  Since the rent guarantee program company has to be involved in the vetting process for the tenant I cant imagine the administrative burden something like this add is worth the time.  Considering its unlikely they would approve any questionable tenants who are more likely to default anyways.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure you could pass the costs on to the tenant but I already struggle to find qualified applicants and don&amp;#39;t need another barrier preventing them from qualifying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10ehtrb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Insurance/comments/10ehtrb/rent_guarantee_insurance_for_landlords_how_does/j4sjj8k/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/10ehtrb/rent_guarantee_insurance_for_landlords_how_does/", "name": "t1_j4sjj8k", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Insurance", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673997965.0, "created_utc": 1673997965.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/10ehtrb/rent_guarantee_insurance_for_landlords_how_does/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qs6s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Help dealing with a flaky Auto Insurance adjuster", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 12, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Insurance", "link_author": "xXBruins37Xx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j4s8t3c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "avengere", "num_comments": 10, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10eoirw", "score": 12, "author_fullname": "t2_76j1r", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Your lease and the total loss are two different things.
