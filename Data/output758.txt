In the first 2-3 weeks I felt extremely bloated and really concerned. It wasn't until I saw someone on here mentioning that same feeling when eating more + lifting that I realised it was a normal initial reaction, and the bloating went down a few weeks later and I didn't feel like a walking balloon anymore.\n\n&gt;How much were you eating before as compared to when you increased?\n\nI used to always eat 1300 and then I moved up to 1650-1700. Nowadays I eat around 2100-2300 as maintenance calories.\n\n&gt;If you were previously eating at a deficit/ consuming not enough to keep up with body demands beforehand, how long did that occur for before the increase?\n\nOn and off for a few years.. I think that if I'd been consistent enough I would have gotten results from it, but it would have been drastic and the fact was that the reason it was never successful was because it wasn't sustainable. I could eat 1700 calories for the rest of my life if I needed to, but 1300 was just too few, so I would be breaking it every week, feeling desperate for chocolate or something else high-energy, etc. \n\n&gt;How fast did you increase calories/ incorporate more into your diet?\n&gt;What happened weight wise?\n\nAnswered this above - incorporated quite slowly but did bloat out for a few weeks. The scale weight went up by about 5lbs in the first 2 weeks or so (terrifying) but then started dropping. It was awesome.\n\n&gt;What happened energy wise?\n&gt;What happened strength wise?\n\nSo much more of both. Nowadays on maintenance calories I can still make gains. Even when I try to bulk I barely gain any weight. \n\n&gt;When did you finally feel comfortable eating more and that the caloric increase was effective?\n\nIt was about a month or two months before I was convinced: when I saw the inches coming off and the weight dropping while gaining muscle, that was pretty awesome. I was losing weight but it felt sustainable, healthy and like I was on the right track. I wasn't exhausted all the time and my heart health was much improved. \n\nAs an additional note, I found weighing and measuring my food for a month was a really positive step. I only weight and measure when I'm not sure nowadays but most of the time I'm pretty on top of it now - but having that month of being super careful was amazing because it really taught me the values of food. e.g. one cup really isn't as much as you think, and bacon here weighs a lot :p\n\nGood luck on your journey - you won't regret it!\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "bear-lifting", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I think most of the ladies here are familiar with &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1ufl0q/progress_pics_writeup_of_my_2013_progress_lighter/\"&gt;my progress from last year&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;-- but there&amp;#39;s the link to pics/ info on it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer your questions directly though:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How long did it take for your body to get accustomed to increased calories?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I moved up quite slowly, by about 100 each day.
