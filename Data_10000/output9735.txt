By overwatering, I mean you're watering too often. When I say this, I'm looking at the lime green tinge to some of the blades, and that your grass blades aren't standing up straight. If you were to go out there in the morning, shortly after sunrise, do you see little droplets on the grass blade tips? Those are exudates, not dew, and are a way grass regulates excess water. Check for that, could be a useful data point. If you see those, it's a good indicator your grass has access to plenty of water.\n\nGrass needing water, in my experience, looks more like a darker pale blueish color.\n\nThink if you were growing grass as a potted plant. If you watered your grass plant twice a day, it wouldn't be happy either. I don't know of any plants that would look good if I watered them twice a day.\n\nTake a look at these pics: [https://imgur.com/a/DZ8ePNT](https://imgur.com/a/DZ8ePNT). Happy grass stands up straight (in my experience).\n\nMy proposal: Stop watering that for three or four days. In your words, you've been going crazy with the watering and you're not happy with the results. Think of what nature does with rain: It causes soil to go through relatively moist and relatively dry cycles. It rains, then it doesn't for a few days. The cycles of relatively moist and relatively dry are good for nutrient uptake. When you water twice per day, it's staying wet all the time and doesn't have a chance to cycle. That's not an optimal environment for plant growth. You want to create an optimal environment as best as you can.\n\nWhen it's time to water that grass again, do it once in the morning and water it deeply. Then don't touch it. Let nature dry it out. I'd bet if you did that, your sod will start looking like sod again shortly. I don't know why the standard recommendation is to constantly water grass, it doesn't work well.\n\nIf you want to do something nice for your grass (we all do lol), and this is optional, but purchase a bag of organic lawn fertilizer (such as Milorganite, etc.) and spread it on the lawn. You won't burn the grass. Even if you were to apply an organic fert at 10x the bag rate on your lawn, it won't burn. You're just going to grow a lot of grass.\n\nOne more tip: Next time you're doing sod, purchase an endomycorrhizal (EM) fungi inoculant mix and spread it over the bare dirt before you lay the sod down. Those fungi spores will germinate when they come into contact with plant roots which is a great fit with sod, because you're essentially laying down a blanket of grass roots. The EM fungi form a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, and in my experience causes an explosion of root growth and plant health. I have tested this with grass and I know it works, the results have been great for me.

By overwatering, I mean you&amp;#39;re watering too often. When I say this, I&amp;#39;m looking at the lime green tinge to some of the blades, and that your grass blades aren&amp;#39;t standing up straight. If you were to go out there in the morning, shortly after sunrise, do you see little droplets on the grass blade tips? Those are exudates, not dew, and are a way grass regulates excess water. Check for that, could be a useful data point. If you see those, it&amp;#39;s a good indicator your grass has access to plenty of water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grass needing water, in my experience, looks more like a darker pale blueish color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think if you were growing grass as a potted plant. If you watered your grass plant twice a day, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be happy either. I don&amp;#39;t know of any plants that would look good if I watered them twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a look at these pics: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/DZ8ePNT\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/DZ8ePNT&lt;/a&gt;. Happy grass stands up straight (in my experience).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My proposal: Stop watering that for three or four days. In your words, you&amp;#39;ve been going crazy with the watering and you&amp;#39;re not happy with the results. Think of what nature does with rain: It causes soil to go through relatively moist and relatively dry cycles. It rains, then it doesn&amp;#39;t for a few days. The cycles of relatively moist and relatively dry are good for nutrient uptake. When you water twice per day, it&amp;#39;s staying wet all the time and doesn&amp;#39;t have a chance to cycle. That&amp;#39;s not an optimal environment for plant growth. You want to create an optimal environment as best as you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s time to water that grass again, do it once in the morning and water it deeply. Then don&amp;#39;t touch it. Let nature dry it out. I&amp;#39;d bet if you did that, your sod will start looking like sod again shortly. I don&amp;#39;t know why the standard recommendation is to constantly water grass, it doesn&amp;#39;t work well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to do something nice for your grass (we all do lol), and this is optional, but purchase a bag of organic lawn fertilizer (such as Milorganite, etc.) and spread it on the lawn. You won&amp;#39;t burn the grass. Even if you were to apply an organic fert at 10x the bag rate on your lawn, it won&amp;#39;t burn. You&amp;#39;re just going to grow a lot of grass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One more tip: Next time you&amp;#39;re doing sod, purchase an endomycorrhizal (EM) fungi inoculant mix and spread it over the bare dirt before you lay the sod down. Those fungi spores will germinate when they come into contact with plant roots which is a great fit with sod, because you&amp;#39;re essentially laying down a blanket of grass roots. The EM fungi form a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, and in my experience causes an explosion of root growth and plant health. I have tested this with grass and I know it works, the results have been great for me.
