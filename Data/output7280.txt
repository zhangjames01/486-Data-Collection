Fender benders should at least be more common if texting was such a pandemic scourge on our attention driving. There's been a steady decline.

Ugh, sounds good as a model but fails in real world comparisons. And all the drivers were holding their phones low like cup-holder level low. You're not going to see shit in the periphery that way of course.  Others I've seen, they make people drive through tight cones in parking lots, throw dummies in front of them or whatever.

Stop making giant billboards that have a slogan that's difficult to read so it means you have to look away at it longer - DNT TXT N DRV!\n\nHate texting? let's also outlaw fiddling with the radio because you drove to an area that doesn't have your presets, opening a snickers bar in your car, spilling a drink on your pants and grabbing napkins from glovebox, checking store signs as you drive by, looking for a street sign, rubbing eye with one eye open, lighting a cigarette, letting your small dog sit on your lap, LED billboards that change every 15 seconds, talking to children in the back seats or handing them a water bottle, there's 100's of fucking things people do while driving besides texting that deviates from perfect, completely focused and eyes on road, two hands on wheel driving.  \n\nAlso unbridled road rage toward phone users can legitimately  cause accidents. My mom was in Colorado with me and it was late, 10 pm, no cars on these giant highways (not interstate roads) in Colorado Springs and heading toward Manitou, she was driving just fine, been driving since she was fucking 12yo and she 65, has driven cross country multiple times. Not an old lady dementia driver. We don't live in CO though and mom was checking gps and pinching and swiping back and forth at it at a light trying to make sure we were on right track to where we were going, was dark, and we were looking at description of landmarks we should look for. A huge black truck pulls up aside us coming off from an exit we just passed. Since I'm  deaf we keep the light on in car to lipread. They could clearly see into car that she was looking at phone -at the stop light-. These guys began honking, rolled down window, yelling at us, screaming put your phone down bitch, you're a fucking idiot for texting!  My mom was flustered and scared. She drove on when green light turned, the truck sped then slowed to stay beside us and kept doing awful things and gestures, and it was the driver doing it! My mom sped up a little trying to discourage them and they caught up. Our turn was the next light and they were on the rightmost side we had to be in to turn. Wouldn't let us over. Would not stop heckling. Threw a cup of old milky coffee on our front window. We braked and finally got in lane behind them. They began tapping brakes in front of us. All because my mom was using her phone at a red light for gps at 9 pm on empty roads? Ludicrous and more dangerous than anything my mom was doing. And before someone says I should have navigated for her, it just doesn't work like that, she uses a horrible android thing with its own map app that I don't understand, and I would make her miss turns so we'd lose time bc you have make an U turn way up ahead if you miss something bc Colorado springs is all medians and U turns!  I also didn't have service and I remember because I wanted to route it myself in my own iPhone's better map apps to help since we were getting lost. \n\nAgain, don't PM me or reply rude things. Downvote me if you want but your blithering  \"internet road rage\" is not going to help. The OP asked a question, I'm answering. The vitriol over this is NOT a productive response and does not solve this issue - people are going to use their phones despite a prohibition. It should be approached as a social problem we can increase  the safety of besides just yelling, \"don't do it!\" (Drugs are bad mmkay!?). Ffs, there's even more sane attitudes about a few drinks of alcohol before driving: people typically agree that 3-4 beers at a restaurant won't really make anyone but a 100 lb teetotaler lady too drunk to drive home.
