If God doesn't have our best interests at heart, why should I like him? If his plan has horrible things happening to good people, why should I respect him?  These things simply don't have to happen.  An all-knowing god should be able to do better work.  \"Free will.\"  Why does this have much to do with anything?  God could have made life a lot better for humanity with some stronger innate moral compasses installed.  We already have an innate drive to eat, reproduce, and socialize: why not ensure outliers of morality are not created?  \"Free will\" does not have to be tied to suffering.  Perhaps another argument is \"God doesn't have time for you.\"  In that case, who does he have time for?  And shouldn't he be able to manage everything?  He's not just really powerful.  He's all powerful.  He can do better.\n\nThen there's the common scripture that I don't like.  God has proven in the Old Testament that he isn't quite a nice guy.  He razed two towns, Sodom and Gomorrah, rather than attempt to save the people within.  That just seems lazy, to be honest.  And then the time where he killed all of those Egyptian kids for the sake of spiting the Pharaoh.  Was that necessary?  No.  In fact, none of it was necessary.  If God wanted his people free, he could have just whisked them away, and not killed innocent people.  Not a very nice thing to do, with the plague and killing children and all.  \n\nThen the concept of hell.  Will being a Christian give me preferential treatment in the afterlife?  If so, shame on God.  There are too many people which that particularly idea damns.   Does he treat people equally, based on how good they are, regardless of religion? Good! Then I still don't care about listening to the guy.  \n\nOh, and as a bonus.  I once heard someone mention their faith in God \"because they have seen miracles.\"  Like the time God stopped killing children to cancer?  Or the time he ended war on Earth?  Or perhaps the time he just had people understand each other on an innate level?  But God has done none of these things, and life continues to be rotten for countless masses.  The Tower of Babylon story reminds us that God is a petty thing, and willing to curse humanity in order to maintain his distance.\n\nI could go on.
