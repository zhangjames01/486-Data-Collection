At the time, I spoke of some unfortunate choices Oliver made shortly before I met him.  Now, I'd like to speak of events long before that time.\n\nOliver was the white child of a woman who lived in the Overbrook neighborhood of Philadelphia.  For those unfamiliar with Philadelphia's landscape, Overbrook  is a dirt poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Philadelphia.  At the time it was primarily black; these days I understand the asians have made headway.  I don't care to know which race dominates at the moment; I no longer live there and as such it strikes me as irrelevant.\n\nOliver's mom was poor as shit; his dad anonymous.  She probably worked in some form of fast food at the time, though I can't say for sure - I'm really only guessing because she worked at a Dunkin' Donuts when I knew him.  Either way, she damned sure couldn't afford private education, so off to public school Oliver went.\n\nI don't know the fine details; what exact percentage of the school was Chinese, Korean, or Black.  I do know that the children of that school weren't wealthy, not by any stretch of the imagination.  Overbrook never really had rich people, and if it ever does I'm certain they'll be educated in private schools, unlike Oliver.  What I do know is that every student of that school knew what hunger was, and anger as well.\n\nThe anger is a given, if I'm honest.  Hungry people are angry.  White, black, yellow; makes no difference - child's belly is empty, it's gonna learn hate.  That's when evolution kicks in.  That's when we draw our lines and decide who is righteously hungry and who is merely an impostor and spy.  That's when we name our outsiders.\n\nBad time to have white skin; for Oliver.  I know the modern Social Justice Warrior chooses to believe that melanin opposes base instinct and therefor every black and brown and yellow is far above sin; but life don't always work like that.  Oliver was white-skinned in a sea of black and yellow; every one of which was as hungry as he was and as full of spite as well.\n\nThey beat him, of course.  He was the outsider, and if the face of their true oppressor wouldn't show itself then he'd do just as well.  Maybe his blood wasn't pink enough, maybe it was.  Doesn't matter, though.  Hit him hard enough, and the fury makes what it will.  Fuck him.  Hunger trumps humanity; without exception.  Someone had to pay, right?\n\nHe told me a story, once.  He was beaten in class, in the hallways; everywhere.  Once he was beaten in the bathroom, between classes.  Ain't no bathroom monitors, so he bled for a good two periods before he was found; tasting piss soaked tile the whole time.  It's a secret I've never told, but he told me that when he was lying there, he wished that they had beaten him harder.  That way, he might have known peace.\n\nThey found him two periods later, and decided an ambulance was necessary.  That wasn't exactly good news for Oliver - he hadn't actually broken a single bone, and it turned out the ambulance wasn't needed.  They slapped some band-aids on him and sent him to his mother, who wasn't all to happy about the bill she expected for the medical evaluation of her son.  She educated him, in a sense; assuming one believes that humanity requires brutality.  He'd not cry like a bitch from minor wounds any longer, once he knew what true abuse was.\n\nThere's a word, though - \"cracker\".  Along with \"honkey\", it resonated with him.  It was what was said when he was beaten, called out time and time again in explanation so that he might know why he deserved such suffering.  It stuck with him.  It drew a line, that he begrudgingly observed.  Us, and them.  There's honkeys and crackers and others, and he knew where he stood.  Knew too well.  Ultimately ate a bullet for it, though he launched the bullet, so who is to say where guilt lies?  Today I don't  doubt that when he dragged that razor over his head, he was remembering why he was beaten the entire time.\n\nPersonally, I don't get it.  \"Cracker\" never accompanied my beatings; it was more wetback and spic.  Maybe I don't draw my lines because I'm morally superior; more likely Philadelphia just ain't got enough brown skin for me to see it viable.  So it goes.  He rots in some unmarked grave, I draw breath that I'd just as soon refuse.  Maybe I survived, maybe I'm wiser, but I'll not piss on him.  Oliver mattered; if only to me.  Dead for more than a decade; and I still shed tears for him from time to time.\n\nAnd today, I see \"people\", who haven't earned their humanity and likely didn't know it was possible, speaking as to how \"cracker\" means nothing.  To them, it's truth - they came of age without knowing suffering; to be racially slurred is little more than a joke.  Call /u/archangellegablielle cracker, it won't matter - it's a stranger to pain, having never learned what death tastes of, to call it \"cracker\" is a venture into the absurd, not the abusive.  To such a thing cracker is a random word; a joke.  To Oliver it was more.  To Oliver, it was why he bled and suffered and if he were resurrected would likely testify that the greatest comfort he knew was tasting the steel of a stolen 9mm and pulling back on the trigger; knowing it would end soon enough.\n\nI probably should be angry.  /u/archangellegabrielle pisses now on the grave of a man who earned his humanity, while it will never do so.  It mocks his suffering, turning his blood seeping into tile and grout into a joke.  I'm not, though.  Oliver was dumb as a butt and twice as ugly, but he's remembered.  I remember him.  I tell others his story, so that he might be remembered.   He earned his humanity through blood seeped out, he sinned through false allegiance, and he died by his hand; but I never forgot him, nor did I forget my part in his demise.  It's more than I can say for others.  It's more than I can say for those who laugh at the suffering of a 6 year old child beaten without mercy for looking different.\n\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Story time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, long ass time ago I spoke about a friend I had by the name of Oliver.

She stayed with NASA until her death - when someone decided \"how about we consider these O-rings a non-problem until they become a problem.\"  Messer and Dunbar were probably there as well, though fucked if I can remember dates.  Sorry if that doesn't work well with your \"nuh-uh no woman could ever work for NASA because I have a comical misunderstanding of history\" dealie.\n\n&gt;I'm pretty sure they did not have a space station either.\n\nI don't doubt you are, but I think it's already been well-established that you're not quite the sharpest scalpel in the abortion clinic.  You're half right, at least - the ISS wasn't launched until the late 90s.  After several decades of planning.  Yeah, oddly enough, we didn't just wake up one morning and decide to toss something into space later that afternoon that would also have people on it.\n\nMuch of NASA's research in the 80s (as well as their international equivalents) went directly into handling the challenges of keeping people alive in space.  This includes menstruation, as well as many other things.\n\n&gt;By this point, men had already done at least 3 of these without issue. The implication of this interview is that for some reason, they were illogically scared of what would happen with menstruation.\n\nTruly our education system is in a poor state when people such as yourself don't understand the differences between pissing, shitting, and menstruating.  I could play the privileged youth and cry that it's not my job to educate you, but such behavior strikes me as shameful.  As such, a quick lesson:\n\nShitting, pissing, and menstruating are not the same thing.  In space, shitting and pissing is handled by attaching a suction tube to the orifice excreting.  This works, as humans tend to shit and piss for short periods of time that they control.  Menstruation doesn't work like that.\n\nI suppose if one was hellbent to use the same solution for all problems we could simply ram a suction tube up the astronaut's cunt until the period is over, but I suspect that could have other complications and I doubt she'd thank you for that.  Fortunately, the people who work for NASA don't share your \"lol period not problem cuz men r dum\" outlook, and have devised less ignorant methods of dealing with such things.  This is for the best - a woman strong enough to travel into space would be ill-served by such a ridiculous (yet non-feels hurting) solution as what you might propose.\n\n&gt;Did you read the interview? The interview is discussing the fear that menstruation would cause health problems. Nothing to do with errant blood flow.\n\nPeople say lots of things; even moreso when they've an agenda.  I don't fault this.  What's embarrassing to me is how quick the naive and sheltered are to gobble down and unquestionably accept anything that suits their world-view, no matter how ridiculous.  I'd wonder if you'd be so quick to believe something said by a male astronaut implying that \"lol no women are the dum 1s\", but I think we all know the answer.\n\nThe real joke, though, is that while you think you're playing for your \"team\" all loyally and just-like, you aren't actually on that team.  Ain't no one at NASA - female or male - ever going to care what you or I think.

Sorry if that doesn&amp;#39;t work well with your &amp;quot;nuh-uh no woman could ever work for NASA because I have a comical misunderstanding of history&amp;quot; dealie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty sure they did not have a space station either.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t doubt you are, but I think it&amp;#39;s already been well-established that you&amp;#39;re not quite the sharpest scalpel in the abortion clinic.  You&amp;#39;re half right, at least - the ISS wasn&amp;#39;t launched until the late 90s.  After several decades of planning.  Yeah, oddly enough, we didn&amp;#39;t just wake up one morning and decide to toss something into space later that afternoon that would also have people on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much of NASA&amp;#39;s research in the 80s (as well as their international equivalents) went directly into handling the challenges of keeping people alive in space.  This includes menstruation, as well as many other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By this point, men had already done at least 3 of these without issue. The implication of this interview is that for some reason, they were illogically scared of what would happen with menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truly our education system is in a poor state when people such as yourself don&amp;#39;t understand the differences between pissing, shitting, and menstruating.  I could play the privileged youth and cry that it&amp;#39;s not my job to educate you, but such behavior strikes me as shameful.  As such, a quick lesson:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shitting, pissing, and menstruating are not the same thing.  In space, shitting and pissing is handled by attaching a suction tube to the orifice excreting.  This works, as humans tend to shit and piss for short periods of time that they control.  Menstruation doesn&amp;#39;t work like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose if one was hellbent to use the same solution for all problems we could simply ram a suction tube up the astronaut&amp;#39;s cunt until the period is over, but I suspect that could have other complications and I doubt she&amp;#39;d thank you for that.  Fortunately, the people who work for NASA don&amp;#39;t share your &amp;quot;lol period not problem cuz men r dum&amp;quot; outlook, and have devised less ignorant methods of dealing with such things.  This is for the best - a woman strong enough to travel into space would be ill-served by such a ridiculous (yet non-feels hurting) solution as what you might propose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Did you read the interview? The interview is discussing the fear that menstruation would cause health problems. Nothing to do with errant blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People say lots of things; even moreso when they&amp;#39;ve an agenda.  I don&amp;#39;t fault this.  What&amp;#39;s embarrassing to me is how quick the naive and sheltered are to gobble down and unquestionably accept anything that suits their world-view, no matter how ridiculous.  I&amp;#39;d wonder if you&amp;#39;d be so quick to believe something said by a male astronaut implying that &amp;quot;lol no women are the dum 1s&amp;quot;, but I think we all know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real joke, though, is that while you think you&amp;#39;re playing for your &amp;quot;team&amp;quot; all loyally and just-like, you aren&amp;#39;t actually on that team.  Ain&amp;#39;t no one at NASA - female or male - ever going to care what you or I think.   The teams you see are wholly in your mind; your opinions here are no less worthless than they&amp;#39;ve been on anything else in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1giwdu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Game0fDolls/comments/1giwdu/nasa_picks_8_new_astronauts_4_of_them_women/cal4bgf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Game0fDolls/comments/1giwdu/nasa_picks_8_new_astronauts_4_of_them_women/", "name": "t1_cal4bgf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Game0fDolls", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1371541949.0, "created_utc": 1371541949.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nasa-picks-8-new-astronauts-4-them-women"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vqco", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "NASA PICKS 8 NEW ASTRONAUTS, 4 OF THEM WOMEN", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 306, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Game0fDolls", "link_author": "SaraSays", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cal3eh7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "atteroero", "num_comments": 65, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cakpnmu", "score": 306, "author_fullname": "t2_6kk30", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is an almost comical oversimplification of reality.
