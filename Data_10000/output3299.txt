And about &amp;quot;shit&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the RIAA, the Beatles are the best-selling band in the United States, with 177 million certified units. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine&amp;#39;s list of the all time most successful &amp;quot;Hot 100&amp;quot; artists; as of 2014, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with 20. They have received ten Grammy Awards, an Academy Award for Best Original Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. Collectively included in Time magazine&amp;#39;s compilation of the 20th century&amp;#39;s 100 most influential people, they are the best-selling band in history, with estimate sales of over 600 million records worldwide.[2][3] In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the greatest artist of all time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(from Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure they&amp;#39;re all just wrong and you know better?

I love that song and recently wrote an essay about it, just couldn't find any place to share it. So, without further comment:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**If you don't like The Beatles**\n\nIf you don't like The Beatles, chances are that there's something wrong with you. Well, you're entitled to your opinion, but most people that claim that they don't like the Beatles actually don't have an idea of who they were and never really listened to them. So I could tell you to you to sit down and read through their entire Wikipedia page (and learn about how they were seen off by more than 3000 people when leaving Heathrow Airport in London in the height of what has been dubbed the \"Beatlemania\" back in '63, just to be greeted by a cheering crowd of more than 4000 when landing at JFK a couple hours later), or to listen to every one of their later records where they singlehandedly revolutionized the entire genre of pop music (the Rolling Stone magazine lists four of their albums from this period in the Top 10 of its \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list), but you do not even need to spend that much time. You only need 3 minutes and 11 seconds.\n\n\"Hey Bulldog\" appeared on the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album in 1969 (which is considered to be one of their weaker works and is not included in the aforementioned Top 10), and it was never released as a single. It's not a song that you would hear on the radio or see some lousy cover band perform at your home town when growing up, and even the Beatles themself probably didn't consider it one of their favourites, but their long-time studio engineer Geoff Emerick called this the last song they recorded that featured a team dynamic with enthusiasm from every member. \"Paul's bass line was probably the most inventive of any he'd done since Pepper, and it was really well played. Harrison's solo was sparkling, too--one of the few times that he nailed it right away. His amp was turned up really loud, and he used one of his new fuzz boxes, which made his guitar absolutely scream.\", he is quoted on the wikipedia page of this hardly known pearl (from where I also stole the fancy \"team dynamic with enthusiasm from every member\" line just before, my apologies).\n\nSo if you can spare 3 minutes and 11 seconds from your doubtlessly very busy life right now, sit down, put on some good headphones, and put the tune in. And LISTEN.\n\nListen to that crazy piano riff firing off in the beginning, joined by Ringo's reckless drumming and Harrisons's \"screaming guitar\" after one bar, and then listen as McCartney's fuzz bass begins to buzz in your ears one bar later (you turned the volume all the way up, did ya?) and.. BAM! All of the sudden the whole song falls into this irresistable groove after not even 14 seconds. Listen how McCartney's bass jumps around the groove, going up and down in a tricky rythm as Lennon sings about a \"sheepdog standing in the rain\", only for the whole song to become somewhat sad in the next line: \"Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles, what makes you think you're something special when you're smile\" - a recurring theme in the song, just a few seconds later we hear: \"some kind of innocence is measured out in years, you don't know what it's like to listen to your fears\" and right then again, BAM! Now they're leaning forward, all of a sudden everybody's pushing, the music starts getting dramatic and at the 1 minute mark, the piano hammers down quarter notes and the song somewhat sounds like Led Zep did in \"Cashmir\", with Lennon screaming his soul out: \"You can talk to me! You can talk to meee! You can - talk - to - me! If you're lonely you can talk to me!\" And while you're still trying to understand what just happened, how the whole song could start and change like this in a little more than a minute, Harrison's guitar kicks in again and NOW it's really screaming, they're building up for his solo and there he goes, he lifts off, Ringo's playing staccatos and that damn bass is punding down every note right, and you HEAR THEM IN THE STUDIO! They're shouting, \"go on, go on! Come on! Whoo! Whoa!\" ...AND they are back in this irresistable groove again, but NOW you listen, and Lennon  goes on again: \"Some kind of solitude is measured out in you, you think you know me but you haven't got a clue\" - he's getting angry, he's feeling it, he's screaming his lungs out, you can hear his voice break: \"If you're lonely you can talk to me!\" \n\nIt goes on after that, but it's hard to describe. They're just going crazy, and after they hit the 3 minute mark, Emerick only has to fade it out. \n\nJohnPaulRingoGeorge. There's more beautiful and innovative music in this song then there is in entire albums from other artists, and although it's more than 40 years old, it still sounds amazing. JohnPaulRingoGeorge.
