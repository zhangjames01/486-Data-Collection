But it is an experience with which many of us, to one degree or another, appear to be familiar with.\n\nMy experiences with men are varied, of course. But when it's bad, it's bad, and there's no mistaking that it becomes bad precisely because of gender. I should also explain in some detail what Rebecca means when she talks about how men often explain that we're subhuman.\n\nYour incredulity, which is vivid in the tone of your questions, likely stems from the fact that you've never actually heard those words spoken \"You are not human, woman\"; they don't have to be, however. Prejudice in its pervasive, structural form is about the subtleties-- white men prefer to look for overt prejudice, call that the only kind of bigotry, and then hold themselves aloft because they aren't, say, neo-Nazis. But real prejudice is *also* covert and couched. When a woman is told that her brain is biologically predisposed to make her bad at maths, auto repair, landing an aircraft, combat, structural engineering, physics, et cetera, she is being told she is less human, in effect. It's no different from when pseudo-biological explanations are used to \"explain\" why non-white people just aren't as clever as Europeans and so forth.\n\nWhen a man says that he is entitled to your time and company, regardless of how you may feel about that prospect, he is saying in so many words that you are less than human. When a man says that the normal rules of empathy and compassion don't apply because you're someone to potentially fuck, he's saying in so many words that you are less than human.\n\nNow, why translate this as \"less than human\"? Because if women were seen as full citizens and persons by these men, it would never enter their minds to degrade us so or use us so. The men who've harassed me in public places clearly subordinated my humanity to their desires and had next to no regard for my comfort, safety, or desires. You may dismiss this as mere rudeness but that's your way of saying it isn't such a big deal. In a society where threats against women are real, to engage in that level of harassment is to make me very afraid that, at the very least, my day's about to go to hell. To insist on putting me in that place even after I say no, politely, again and again, is to disregard my humanity. You listen to a human when she says no. When a sex object says no, it just means yes (and according to a Yale fraternity if she says yes, yes means anal).\n\nFurthermore, for specific types of women there are specific types of degradation. I'm a transsexual woman, and so when a man says that it's perfectly understandable that men will want to hurt me if I'm not \"honest\" with them about my medical history, that is their way of saying that I'm less than human. Their prurient entitlement is more important than my dignity and right to life. Rights that, if I were a white cis man, liberal men would have no problem saying are unequivocally mine at all times.\n\n&gt;Richard Dawkins took the side of the man in this scenario and claimed (and I'm paraphrasing) that the man made a request, was rejected and left the woman to herself. He didn't touch her or swear. He just complimented her speech and asked if she'd like coffee. Which she was free to refuse (and did).\n\nRichard Dawkins also very flagrantly appropriated the struggles of Muslim women to make a cheap rhetorical point. That's not trivial, and that's also a species of dehumanisation. I really am still in shock that he even had the audacity to write that sarcastic first comment. Let's go to the videotape:\n\n&gt;Dear Muslima\n\n&gt;Stop whining, will you. Yes, yes, I know you had your genitals mutilated with a razor blade, and . . . yawn . . . don't tell me yet again, I know you aren't allowed to drive a car, and you can't leave the house without a male relative, and your husband is allowed to beat you, and you'll be stoned to death if you commit adultery. But stop whining, will you. Think of the suffering your poor American sisters have to put up with.\n\n&gt;Only this week I heard of one, she calls herself Skep\"chick\", and do you know what happened to her? A man in a hotel elevator invited her back to his room for coffee. I am not exaggerating. He really did. He invited her back to his room for coffee. Of course she said no, and of course he didn't lay a finger on her, but even so . . .\n\n&gt;And you, Muslima, think you have misogyny to complain about! For goodness sake grow up, or at least grow a thicker skin.\n\n&gt;Richard\n\n\nMuslima? Really?\n\nIt was very clear that to the extent he \"cares\" about the suffering of Muslim women it's only to deny Ms. Watson her humanity and agency.\n\n(Protip: If you're interested in reading real work about Muslim women *by and for* Muslim women, read Lila Abu-Lughod or Fatema Mernissi. Do not read Richard Dawkins.)\n\nWhen women are told \"your problems pale in comparison to what us men are doing in &lt;country of non-white persons here&gt;\" there is an implicit threat there. Stop whining or maybe we'll become more like Saudi Arabia. There's also the gaslighting that inheres to this: \"But this hurts and I'd like it to stop...\" \"It's not a real problem, woman, dudes just want to have sex with you and it's a compliment!\" All of that is dehumanising.\n\nNow to this point:\n\n&gt;Do you live in fear of rape?\n\nThis is a bad question and always has been, I think, very much a question asked from the perspective of men. Women's lives are lived, with and without the threat of rape. It is not a question of whether we live in fear but what we know we have to live with. Living in fear creates an image of terror, cowering, victimisation and so forth that simply doesn't sync up with my life and the lives of many women I know whose strength is hard to describe. But they know what time it is, as a good friend of mine says. They're able to sit around a table with me and sigh as they talk about the \"rape schedule\" we all have to live by that adds calculations to our minds when we think about going out alone or going out late and so forth.\n\nBeing a trans woman I've lived on both sides of this as it were. Even pre-transition I was always pretty scrawny and nerdy, and I was mugged twice in my neighbourhood. When I transitioned at 21, however, I suddenly learned that my little apprehensions about street crime were nothing compared to my new \"schedule.\" Rape is far worse than simply having your wallet filched, and that is a very guiding concern. Dealing with that is less about fear than planning. When I was younger I could walk around the city late at night without a care in the world. Now I'm very apprehensive about this and would only do so in a group. I could walk past bars of rowdy men at 2AM and not worry. Now... not so much.\n\nMen defend all of this as either being my problem or not a problem at all. They never have to *say* \"you aren't human, deal with it.\"\n\nThey just heavily imply it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My question(s) is: do women really feel this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of us can speak for all of us, to be quite sure.

There&amp;#39;s also the gaslighting that inheres to this: &amp;quot;But this hurts and I&amp;#39;d like it to stop...&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not a real problem, woman, dudes just want to have sex with you and it&amp;#39;s a compliment!&amp;quot; All of that is dehumanising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to this point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you live in fear of rape?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a bad question and always has been, I think, very much a question asked from the perspective of men. Women&amp;#39;s lives are lived, with and without the threat of rape. It is not a question of whether we live in fear but what we know we have to live with. Living in fear creates an image of terror, cowering, victimisation and so forth that simply doesn&amp;#39;t sync up with my life and the lives of many women I know whose strength is hard to describe. But they know what time it is, as a good friend of mine says. They&amp;#39;re able to sit around a table with me and sigh as they talk about the &amp;quot;rape schedule&amp;quot; we all have to live by that adds calculations to our minds when we think about going out alone or going out late and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a trans woman I&amp;#39;ve lived on both sides of this as it were. Even pre-transition I was always pretty scrawny and nerdy, and I was mugged twice in my neighbourhood. When I transitioned at 21, however, I suddenly learned that my little apprehensions about street crime were nothing compared to my new &amp;quot;schedule.&amp;quot; Rape is far worse than simply having your wallet filched, and that is a very guiding concern. Dealing with that is less about fear than planning. When I was younger I could walk around the city late at night without a care in the world. Now I&amp;#39;m very apprehensive about this and would only do so in a group. I could walk past bars of rowdy men at 2AM and not worry. Now... not so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men defend all of this as either being my problem or not a problem at all. They never have to &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;you aren&amp;#39;t human, deal with it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They just heavily imply it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_ihz6d", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ihz6d/a_few_honest_questions_for_the_women_of_reddit/c23yo82/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ihz6d/a_few_honest_questions_for_the_women_of_reddit/", "name": "t1_c23yo82", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1309971851.0, "created_utc": 1309971851.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ihz6d/a_few_honest_questions_for_the_women_of_reddit/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I'm 23 and my mother still abuses me.
