Huge upgrade from the 4 previous boards i have owned and built. (2012 das keyboard with cherry blue's, 2014ish keycool 84 with gateron browns, 2018 custom 96 layout build kit, 2020 epomaker 84 shitboard with rgb light keycaps) It just depends on what you want. I actually prefer the sound of the th80 keycap profile but for me the profile was too different from what i am used to (cherry profile or oem) I must say they are a very comfortable profile but i was making typing errors a lot because the keys felt bigger.\n\nBut as far as sound and quality feel go there is no significant difference so if you like the keycap profile of the th80 i would go with that for sure.\n\nNow the switches themselves (i think the switches on all of the nj80 boards are overlubed so take these opinions on them with a grain of salt):\n\n**budgerigar switches on the th80:**\n\nI have to say the are my LEAST favorite in terms of gaming/typing comfort and speed. They are a cool experience and are unique but there is no way I could run them as a daily driver. Way too much force to press them down for touch typing 120 wpm and the tactile bump starts right away when you press the key. Cool experience but if you type fast i have a feeling these will not help you.\n\n**Gateron pro milky yellow switches on nj80:**\n\nI think the prebuilts from amazon on the nj80 boards are over lubed so these did not feel great for fast typing or spamming keys in games. The over lube i think is making the switches not bounce back as fast as they should. So ignoring that i think the weight is just a tiny smidge too heavy for me for a linear switch ( im not a huge fan of linear to begin with so theres that) They do feel really smooth but part of that could be the slight overlube.\n\n**Gateron pro brown switches on nj80:**\n\nsadly they are over lubed slightly as well so it effects the bounce back time. They do feel MILES better then regular gateron browns, nice and smooth no scratch and just feels like a pure upgrade from regular gateron browns. Very nice if you are a die hard brown user like me it's worth it to just upgrade to these and maybe lube them yourself (if you are not lazy like i am) but read below this for another potential brown switch upgrade.\n\n**Baby Kangaroo's on the nj80:**\n\nThese by far sound the best to me. You get a little sound feedback but not as much as on a clicky switch and its nice and deep sounding, this is a good sweetspot of not being annoying to hear and being satisfying to listen to. Out of all the switches on the nj80 prebuilts these feel the best, it's either the spring weight is a tad heavier making the bounce back time faster even if they are over lubed or maybe these were the only ones that were not over lubed. The spring weight is for sure heavier then a brown but not by much. I only sometimes don't use enough force when touch typing fast and am only slightly behind on typing speed compared to browns. \n\nThese are just straight up fun to use, very satisfying bump and sound. I am for sure a function over form type of person and if these significantly slowed me down on typing or gaming i would not use them but the decrease in efficiency is so little compared to how much fun they are that these are going to be my main for now. I just needed a prebuilt for work that i didn't need to fiddle with modding it till i get more time to actually dive in and get exactly what i want. So for now the nj80 with baby kangaroo's will work. Down the line im thinking about spring swapping these with a brown switch spring, i tried that already with the other nj80 with browns in it and it felt a little lighter and you still get the feel of the bump. But like i said i do not have the tools to do this in a timely manner and needed something in the mean time for typing at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are a diehard gigachad gateron brown switch enjoyer maybe give the baby kangaroo's a try.

Like i said i like gateron browns but i looked up the Budgerigar switches and they sound good to me. \n\nand finally the Fantech MAXFIT8 that has only one type of tactile switch which is the Gateron Pro V2 Brown. \n\nBetween the Budgerigar and the baby kangaroo which do people like more? I know the bbk switches are heavier but they seem more popular. Also on the nj80 page there is a switch called the BOX Blueberry Ice Cream Pro but I have found no info on it at all.\n\nThanks for any and all help on choosing!!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of research I have narrowed down my picks between keydous NJ80-AP, EPOMAKER TH80 Pro and the Fantech MAXFIT8.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have other suggestions that would be great, I&amp;#39;m looking only for:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;amazon only&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;complete boards only&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;tactile/clicky switches only&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;under $200&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions with that criteria in mind? What i have gathered so far is that the nj80 is slightly more premium then the th80 and has better sound dampening. The Fantech MAXFIT8I looks like a good option as well but only has Gateron Pro V2 Brown switches as an option. I want a nice thick thock sound with good stabs, i can mod the stabs if i need to but prefer not having to do that. Looks like i would want a board with lots of foam and maybe even a gasket mount. I really don&amp;#39;t like the high pitched ping sound and want to get as deep of a sound as i can. Just curious if anyone has any experience with these boards or has other suggestions for premium prebuilts under $200 on amazon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the NJ80 I would most likely be getting brass plate with baby kangaroo switches, i also saw they had BOX Blueberry Ice Cream Pro switches but i tried looking them up and there is no info on them, are they tactile? I prefer lighter tactile switches like gateron browns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the epomaker th80 i would go with the Budgerigar Switch or maybe the pro brown? Like i said i like gateron browns but i looked up the Budgerigar switches and they sound good to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and finally the Fantech MAXFIT8 that has only one type of tactile switch which is the Gateron Pro V2 Brown. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between the Budgerigar and the baby kangaroo which do people like more?
