Really it's that simple. I work at a deli. I'll have  a line of people in front of the counter. The folks waiting in line are looking at my case the whole time, looking at the meats and cheeses on display, looking at the list of products and prices. But when their turn comes, I ask what they'd like, and like seven times out of ten they'll just say something along the lines of \"pound of turkey.\"\n\nThis is a deli. Any deli will have like 3 or 4 varieties of turkey, and my particular store has WAY more than that. You just spent several minutes looking at all your choices. WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK ONE?! It's  frustrating because then I have to spend time going over all the options verbally, which holds up the line. A lot of times I'll just ask if they want the plain oven-roasted turkey, which is most popular, and that's usually acceptable. But still, I don't know if you like that brand. I don't know how much money you want to spend. There are options, so do me a favor and pick one.\n\n I mean you wouldn't walk in to subway and just say \"yeah, I want a sandwich.\" And expect that to be adequate. You wouldn't walk into a gamestop and say \"yeah give me a shooting game.\" You ask for things specifically. So please, don't be intimidated by the deli selection. And please don't ask \"HOW spicy is this cajun turkey??\" I can't quantify that for you. It's spicy. Some people will love it, some people will hate it. Ask for a sample.\n\nEDIT: Moar deli stuff\n\nOkay. There are two ways I will typically cut your meat. Sliced, and shaved. I'll always ask you which you prefer before I start cutting. Sliced means you will get a stack of uniform slices. You can request thinner or thicker slices if you prefer. Shaved means I will cut it as thinly as possible. So thinly that picking it up will usually cause it to fall apart, so as I cut it each shaved piece falls into a pile. Again, these are your options, please pick one. I don't know how many times in my day I ask \"would you like that sliced or shaved?\" and get a response like \"Ohhh y'know, not shaved but not sliced? Like somewhere in the middle??\" There really isn't a middleground. If you want thin slices ask for thin slices. I don't know what you mean when you say \"shaved but not shaved\". And never ask for cheese shaved. It isn't really possible and there's no point. \n\nALSO! Don't ask me to go and open a new package of meat just for you. I assure you the piece I have already open in my case is fresh. When we open a package of turkey, all 5 or 6 pounds of it will be sold within a day or two, and it stays tightly wrapped between uses. When you ask me to get a brand new piece, it's entitled, it's a waste of my time, and it's mildly insulting when someone insinuates I'd sell less than fresh food. Furthermore, if I did comply and opened a new package for you, that doesn't mean the currently open one goes away. I still have to sell the first one I opened first, which means this new piece that I opened just for you is going to sit in my case, needlessly opened, for the rest of the day or until the first piece sells.\n\nLastly. There is no such fucking thing as \"lean bacon\". Bacon is FATTY. ALWAYS. BACON=FAT, FAT=BACON, WHY WOULD YOU EVEN BUY BACON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT FAT. I have several customers who will ask me to find the \"leanest bacon\" I have. What you see in the case is pretty much what you get. I do have a huge box in the back full of more bacon, yes, but I assure you, any difference between the fat content in THAT bacon, and the bacon you're currently looking at, will be NEGLIGIBLE. It's all from the same pork belly anyway so the strips are pretty uniform. I'm not saying that some bacon doesn't come with less fat on it; it does happen, but to waste my time asking me to dig through thirty pounds of bacon just so you can avoid a 5% difference in fat content is entitled, and picky, and rude, and pointless. If you want lean bacon, buy some ham. One time, seriously, I got some bacon for a woman who told me it was too fatty. She asked for leaner bacon 'from the back'. I explained to her it won't be much different at all. She didn't care. I went to the back cooler, walked around in a circle for a minute, and came back to her with the same exact strips I'd already shown her. \"Y'know these strips DO look a bit leaner to me,\" I said, \"What do you think?\" \nI'll never forget this. \"OH that looks much better! Thank you so much young man\" she said. Kill me.

But when their turn comes, I ask what they&amp;#39;d like, and like seven times out of ten they&amp;#39;ll just say something along the lines of &amp;quot;pound of turkey.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a deli. Any deli will have like 3 or 4 varieties of turkey, and my particular store has WAY more than that. You just spent several minutes looking at all your choices. WHY DIDN&amp;#39;T YOU PICK ONE?! It&amp;#39;s  frustrating because then I have to spend time going over all the options verbally, which holds up the line. A lot of times I&amp;#39;ll just ask if they want the plain oven-roasted turkey, which is most popular, and that&amp;#39;s usually acceptable. But still, I don&amp;#39;t know if you like that brand. I don&amp;#39;t know how much money you want to spend. There are options, so do me a favor and pick one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean you wouldn&amp;#39;t walk in to subway and just say &amp;quot;yeah, I want a sandwich.&amp;quot; And expect that to be adequate. You wouldn&amp;#39;t walk into a gamestop and say &amp;quot;yeah give me a shooting game.&amp;quot; You ask for things specifically. So please, don&amp;#39;t be intimidated by the deli selection. And please don&amp;#39;t ask &amp;quot;HOW spicy is this cajun turkey??&amp;quot; I can&amp;#39;t quantify that for you. It&amp;#39;s spicy. Some people will love it, some people will hate it. Ask for a sample.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Moar deli stuff&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay. There are two ways I will typically cut your meat. Sliced, and shaved. I&amp;#39;ll always ask you which you prefer before I start cutting. Sliced means you will get a stack of uniform slices. You can request thinner or thicker slices if you prefer. Shaved means I will cut it as thinly as possible. So thinly that picking it up will usually cause it to fall apart, so as I cut it each shaved piece falls into a pile. Again, these are your options, please pick one. I don&amp;#39;t know how many times in my day I ask &amp;quot;would you like that sliced or shaved?&amp;quot; and get a response like &amp;quot;Ohhh y&amp;#39;know, not shaved but not sliced? Like somewhere in the middle??&amp;quot; There really isn&amp;#39;t a middleground. If you want thin slices ask for thin slices. I don&amp;#39;t know what you mean when you say &amp;quot;shaved but not shaved&amp;quot;. And never ask for cheese shaved. It isn&amp;#39;t really possible and there&amp;#39;s no point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALSO! Don&amp;#39;t ask me to go and open a new package of meat just for you. I assure you the piece I have already open in my case is fresh. When we open a package of turkey, all 5 or 6 pounds of it will be sold within a day or two, and it stays tightly wrapped between uses. When you ask me to get a brand new piece, it&amp;#39;s entitled, it&amp;#39;s a waste of my time, and it&amp;#39;s mildly insulting when someone insinuates I&amp;#39;d sell less than fresh food. Furthermore, if I did comply and opened a new package for you, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean the currently open one goes away. I still have to sell the first one I opened first, which means this new piece that I opened just for you is going to sit in my case, needlessly opened, for the rest of the day or until the first piece sells.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly. There is no such fucking thing as &amp;quot;lean bacon&amp;quot;. Bacon is FATTY. ALWAYS. BACON=FAT, FAT=BACON, WHY WOULD YOU EVEN BUY BACON IF YOU DON&amp;#39;T WANT TO EAT FAT. I have several customers who will ask me to find the &amp;quot;leanest bacon&amp;quot; I have. What you see in the case is pretty much what you get. I do have a huge box in the back full of more bacon, yes, but I assure you, any difference between the fat content in THAT bacon, and the bacon you&amp;#39;re currently looking at, will be NEGLIGIBLE. It&amp;#39;s all from the same pork belly anyway so the strips are pretty uniform. I&amp;#39;m not saying that some bacon doesn&amp;#39;t come with less fat on it; it does happen, but to waste my time asking me to dig through thirty pounds of bacon just so you can avoid a 5% difference in fat content is entitled, and picky, and rude, and pointless. If you want lean bacon, buy some ham. One time, seriously, I got some bacon for a woman who told me it was too fatty. She asked for leaner bacon &amp;#39;from the back&amp;#39;. I explained to her it won&amp;#39;t be much different at all. She didn&amp;#39;t care. I went to the back cooler, walked around in a circle for a minute, and came back to her with the same exact strips I&amp;#39;d already shown her. &amp;quot;Y&amp;#39;know these strips DO look a bit leaner to me,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;What do you think?&amp;quot; \nI&amp;#39;ll never forget this. &amp;quot;OH that looks much better! Thank you so much young man&amp;quot; she said. Kill me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_31metm", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/31metm/what_is_one_simple_thing_that_everyone_can_do/cq33tef/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31metm/what_is_one_simple_thing_that_everyone_can_do/", "name": "t1_cq33tef", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1428340053.0, "created_utc": 1428340053.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31metm/what_is_one_simple_thing_that_everyone_can_do/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What are you looking for?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "FenomG", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cq33fnh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "The-Deliverator", "num_comments": 832, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_31mpev", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4xazh", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "A car.
