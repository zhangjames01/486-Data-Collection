It&amp;#39;s the only way this will get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree the only downside is scumfuck builders/developers will just pass those costs on to the tenants when rents are already sky high... which in turn will yet again drive more people to SFH and sprawl because renting becomes more expensive versus owning a house. If you can rent in the city for say 2500 but you can live 45 minutes away for 2200 and have three times as much room it is obvious which people will pick.

You need a rod to punish people for antisocial behavior sometimes now sure you also need a carrot, but you need that rod for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It goes ahead of this discussions, but the root causes of crime need to be tackled - and those are misery and poverty&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I agree those are important to tackle you do realize the people they are victimizing are also poor and miserable too right? The only difference is they are not smoking meth and stabbing people because they are not pieces of shit and have made the conscious decision to not be a criminal who hurts people so why are we not punishing those who made the wrong decision? I am not one of those rich or middle class fucks I grew up lower class and have been poor most of my life but I didn&amp;#39;t hurt people because of it instead I had to deal with criminal scum who did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11rhlfd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/stupidpol/comments/11rhlfd/la_riders_bail_on_metro_trains_amid_horror_of/jch8hzh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/11rhlfd/la_riders_bail_on_metro_trains_amid_horror_of/", "name": "t1_jch8hzh", "author_flair_template_id": "e34e05c6-05b9-11ec-8e87-321e3513cbaa", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stupidpol", "author_flair_text": "Brocialist \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf56\ud83d\ude0e", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678998497.0, "created_utc": 1678998497.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#ff5758", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-14/horror-the-deadly-use-of-drugs-on-metro-trains"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_hitz3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Rant about representation and inclusion", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "stupidpol", "link_author": "BomberRURP", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jch7amu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Aaod", "num_comments": 26, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcf4uou", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_7ex4i", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I had to replace my video card a year ago because it died and even though I just needed a mid end card I had to pay some scalper from Japan gobs of money for it.
