I am under 30, have 7 years of experience professionally with software development, make $110k, and have no college degree (I quit college after 1 semester). I do not live in New York, Seattle, or silicon valley, so $110k is quite lucrative for my locale. I have heard that developers around my level with FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) can make numbers more like $2-400k, although I can't say that with certainty because... I don't know if those companies would hire me due to my lack of college. Plus, I don't want to uproot my family, so I don't have any desire to try.\n\nI did not, however, directly apply to be an engineer with my company. I created some excel macros to help myself handle some calls while providing phone support, and was then pulled into the engineering space and taught C# and JavaScript. I'd been creating excel macros for about a year before that, and completely taught myself VBA (Visual Basic for Applications - don't learn it) using Excel's macro recorder and Google.\n\nI started my first engineering role at ~$55k.\n\n---\n\nJavaScript is a tremendously fun language because it can do anything. Well.... Anything that doesn't have to be blazingly fast (like machine learning or other massive data crunching). Those are moreso the domains of Python or Rust (idk I'm a js dev). But, JavaScript can write highly efficient web services, make front end web applications, create command line tools, or make desktop applications.\n\nAlmost every web app you use has JavaScript in it, but some of the desktop or phone apps you use are also fully JavaScript. Slack, Discord, and Visual Studio Code are all examples of desktop apps that run on a JavaScript platform called Electron.\n\nMy expertise is in ReactJs and its tooling. React is interesting because it enables you to make an entire UI application without ever leaving a JavaScript file. Some React frameworks - like Remix Run or NextJs - even create a full-stack all-in-one app that has both the back and front end. Heck, in remix your back end functions and front end route components live _in the same file_.\n\nOne thing I would note, OP mentioned NodeJs as a back end technology, but almost all modern JavaScript tooling (like the apps that generate new projects, or build your JavaScript into HTML and CSS files) will run on and require Node, so having some level of understanding of it is helpful.\n\n---\n\nTools to get started with JavaScript:  \n* Node. This is the JavaScript runtime that will execute your code.  \n* npm. This used to stand for \"node package manager\", but iirc it's just the name of a company now. It helps you install libraries other people wrote. Node comes with a version of `npm` installed with it, so I wouldn't recommend going and installing this yourself.  \n* nvm. Node Version Manager makes it so you can easily install and swap between multiple versions of Node. This can be handy because node comes out with cool new features all the time, but your old apps might not fully work on the newer Node or NPM versions yet. I'd probably recommend installing this first, using it to install Node, and just using the version of NPM that comes with that.  \n* Visual Studio Code (generally referred to as \"VS Code\"). This is NOT the same thing as Visual Studio. VS Code is a free opensource product maintained by Microsoft that is incredibly malleable and excellent for JavaScript development. Visual Studio (no \"Code\") is a paid Microsoft product that is for writing like C# or something.\n\n---\n\nDon't know where to start? If you know HTML (or maybe if you're brave and don't) head on over to ReactJs.com and follow their getting started guide. Alternatively, while I haven't done this, there's an awesome guy who teaches JavaScript named Wes Bos who has a free course called like \"JavaScript 30 30\" or something, which gives you 30 JavaScript projects to learn over 30 days.\n\n---\n\nI guess as a final note - and I'm sorry if I'm saying things that were already said, I didn't read the full OP :| -  I'll say that you can't really get by in software engineering with only knowing 1 technology. Don't stick your head in the JavaScript sand and close off too everything else. I use JS, docker, CICD, nginx, HTML, CSS, SQL, NoSQL, REST, git, and a boatload more, on a daily basis.

I figured some of y'all may be interested in hearing my thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; # The Bad\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Suspension\n&gt; \n&gt; The Model Y is a very firm vehicle, it's not like a cushion or a pillow ride like some air suspension vehicles have. My friend has a Q8, which is way better than my Model Y.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Road-Trip Ability / Charging\n&gt; \n&gt; The supercharger network is praised upon by many people transitioning to Tesla vehicles but in my experience, it's been a mixed bag. I never felt like I would run out of range and always made it to my destination/supercharger with at least 10% battery. Supercharging is annoying.\n&gt; \n&gt; I made a trip to Houston and back in my Model Y and there are 3 charging stops along the way. The way it's mapped you have 2 options. If you stop at the first charger (Corsicana TX) you would have to stop at the 3rd Charger (Huntsville TX) otherwise you wouldn't make it. You may be thinking ok just go to the charger in the middle and have one-stop. That's even worse because Tesla only put 4 stalls at that location.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the way to Houston, I had 4 cars AHEAD of me. I waited 30 min just to get a spot, it was fine 25 min and I'd be on my way. I was kinda annoyed because a trip that takes 4 hrs 30 took close to 5 and a half hours pretty much. On the way back I figured I'd go to the outer two chargers, guess what happened, another wait, at both. The first one was a 15-minute wait then a 10-minute charge. The second one was a 10-minute wait with a 10 min charge.\n&gt; \n&gt; I guess a pro of taking the Tesla vs my Lexus was the charging was free, I got 2,000 free supercharging miles when I bought my vehicle.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Inconsistent Build Quality\n&gt; \n&gt; Originally I had a VIN for my vehicle which I was supposed to take delivery mid-august. The car got to the Plano Service center for delivery when they realized this car got issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; First, it started with a cracked windshield from transportation, didn't really care, delivery was delayed 1 day. The next day (supposed to be the delivery day) I get a call the vehicle has paint bubbles and needs to go to the body shop, it'll be another week, but they put me into a Model X loaner. The car got back to the body shop then it needed to back because the hood had a few bubbles and the dash needed to be replaced because of some scratching.\n&gt; \n&gt; I actually stopped by the Tesla service center to see the car and its issues, I probably shouldn't have but I didn't really care because I've already paid for the car that I didn't have. (you are required to pay for the car in Texas before delivery due to Texas laws and not giving Tesla a sales license). I saw the scratch and the paint bubbles, I thought to myself, I'm spending a lot on a car and it's not good quality and its been to the body shop twice, do I want this VIN. The answer was No.\n&gt; \n&gt; I got a regional sales manager involved who put me into a new vin (car I currently own).It took an additional week and the vehicle was flawless but it's annoying and stupid I had to go through this process. They gave me $2,000 off the car so I guess they made up for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Misc\n&gt; \n&gt; Another stupid con is with 8 cameras I really would've thought a 360 camera would be possible but I guess it isn't.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Pros\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Acceleration\n&gt; \n&gt; Even though my car is the Long Range AWD version and goes 0-60 in 4.8 it feels insane from the stop. Super quick and gives me a giggle and a smile every time I do it. The funniest is when you have passengers. I personally find the 30mph-85mph to be even more insane. I think it accelerates faster from 30 than from 0. (haven't really gone over 85)\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Technology / Software Updates\n&gt; \n&gt; I love that my car gets a software update. The infotainment/software in many cars changes frequently but in the Model Y, every car gets software updates. The Model Y I bought a year ago has the same software as brand new cars. Over the last year, I've gotten new features and the UI has been revised a little in December 2020.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Autopilot\n&gt; \n&gt; I have Basic Autopilot, I do not have the fsd crap, and I'm glad I don't. The basic autopilot keeps me in my lane which is good enough for me. I had a loaner Model 3 while mine was getting an A/C filter change last week, that once had FSD, all it gave me (that was useful) was lane changing. For $10k I don't have any issues changing lanes myself. Maybe when I go on a road trip I'll subscribe to FSD for $200/month.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Efficiency\n&gt; \n&gt; In my 11,000 miles, I have spent roughly $290 on home charging. I'm going to say my 2013 Lexus GS350 gets 25MPG. If you take 11k and divide by 25MPG you get 440. I would have used 440 gallons on the Lexus. 440 gallons x premium gas cost (3.4 in Dallas) you get $1,496. 1,496-290 is a saving of $1,206. If you drive a ton having an EV is super cost-effective.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Cargo Space\n&gt; \n&gt; I've also found the cargo room is really good, between the Front trunk and trunk there is a lot of room. The ride height is nice, and the rear-seat legroom is very roomy, way bigger, and more spacious than the Model 3.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## Misc\n&gt; \n&gt; - **Regenerative braking**: One pedal driving is amazing. You get used to it after a few hours/days but once you get used to it you feel it's amazing. \n&gt; - **Seat material**: The seats are super soft and comfy. They really feel nice.\n&gt; - **Home charging**: When I am at home I plug in every night so I have a full tank every day. It's very convenient.\n&gt; \n&gt; # Summary\n&gt; \n&gt; The question is would I do this purchase again knowing what I know now? Yes! I love the way it drives and the tech is phenomenal. The downsides are a small price to pay for the fun drive and great tech. Tesla still has aways to go with quality/fit and finish.
