If you choose the bailout, you remove the rule of law provisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BTW - on the rule of law, lots of other countries may be vulnerable too. For example see this tweet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacaesBruno/status/1329741313265332225\"&gt;https://twitter.com/MacaesBruno/status/1329741313265332225&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A number of decisions on Islam taken by the French government recently would trigger a EU rule of law debate and procedure if taken by Hungary or Poland. That is also a problem we hope the new rules can address: make the procedure truly independent of political considerations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of countries in eastern europe would gleefully trigger cases against France just out of spite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the end, I expect the EU will cave and abandon the rule of law given that so many countries don&amp;#39;t bother with it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_jxn8zx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/jxn8zx/thread_from_lucas_guttenberg_on_why_the_eu_cant/gcxx64v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/jxn8zx/thread_from_lucas_guttenberg_on_why_the_eu_cant/", "name": "t1_gcxx64v", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/europe", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1605881609.0, "created_utc": 1605881609.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/jxn8zx/thread_from_lucas_guttenberg_on_why_the_eu_cant/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Thread from Lucas Guttenberg on why the EU can't use enhanced cooperation to get around the Polish and Hungarian vetoes on the budget", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "europe", "link_author": "aenor", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gcxsjtk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "aenor", "num_comments": 31, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gcxrb5i", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_bkjlv", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 1, "body": "The only way to defeat Orban is democratically - i.e. persuading the Hungarians not to re-elect him.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to defeat Orban is democratically - i.e. persuading the Hungarians not to re-elect him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_jxn8zx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/europe/comments/jxn8zx/thread_from_lucas_guttenberg_on_why_the_eu_cant/gcxsjtk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/jxn8zx/thread_from_lucas_guttenberg_on_why_the_eu_cant/", "name": "t1_gcxsjtk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/europe", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1605878641.0, "created_utc": 1605878641.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/jxn8zx/thread_from_lucas_guttenberg_on_why_the_eu_cant/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4j", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Time to call Hungary and Poland\u2019s bluff", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "europe", "link_author": "JackRogers3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gcxj1u0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "aenor", "num_comments": 63, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gcunwm2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_bkjlv", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The problem with enhanced cooperation is detailed in this thread:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/lucasguttenberg/status/1328360084196483075\n\nBasically enhanced co-operation requires an intergovernmental treaty.
