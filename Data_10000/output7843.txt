All 7 were built in the last 4 years and I was the driving force. I don't keep tabs on how rich I am (building something is more important), but I don't think about how much I spend personally, ever. That does not mean I buy heaps of consumer crap and try to look rich, it just means I buy what makes me happy. I have a wife and a child and they spend whatever they want on what makes them happy. I know lots of extremely rich people who are worth between 10 million to over 3 billion and not one of them tries to look rich.\n\nYou are much more likely to get rich if you are passionate about anything other than being rich, so find your passion. This is how I worked mine out:\n\nWhen I was 15 I realised that after a while most people don't like what they do as a job after 20 years of doing it. I realised that if I had a choice of either going to work or looking after a sick family member I would choose the family member. I also realised that if I was going to sell the best part of my life I would sell it for the most money I could get. If you were paid $50,000 pa for 40 years of work (between the ages of 20 and 60) you would have sold the best hours and years of your life for the paltry sum of $2,000,000 (excluding wage inflation). I did the hardest Maths and Economics I could find and became a business analyst for large firms looking to save 0.1% off their costs or increase their profits by the same amount per year. This works out to be a lot of money and taught me why some businesses are very successful and others which look the same are not so successful. You need to learn how money works.\n\nMy passion is building things, business is my Art, just like some artists paint. I express myself through business. My businesses are built to provide a quality benefit to both our clients, staff and stakeholders. We never rip people off by doing the wrong thing. This is my passion!!!\n\nThe basics: The most important part about being financially free is understanding how money works:\n\n   1.\n\n      Treat money the way it treats you. When did money last tell you it loved you? Money is a sociopath so treat it the same. This is NOT the same as treating your employees, clients, stakeholders or the people around you like a sociopath. When making decisions about money make them without any emotion.\n   2.\n\n      Realise what risk is - Risk is just ignorance about something. It would be risky for me to operate on someone because I am not a surgeon. If I educated myself to be a surgeon then the risk that I would kill someone would be lower. Educate yourself about things and there will be little to less risk that I lost my money.\n   3.\n\n      Return on investment is a measure of how much risk is in an investment. The more you educate yourself about the investment, the lower the risk. You still get the same ROI, but the risk is lower so you are getting a return on your knowledge.\n   4.\n\n      Debt is NOT a bad thing. Debt is often a good thing. If you can borrow money at 5% and make 10% on it then you have made essentially free money. Make sure you educate yourself about the risk (see point 2 and 3).\n   5.\n\n      You need to realise that in business 8 of out 10 businesses fail at some point. If you want to have a successful business you must start at least 10 businesses. Do not start one business, fail and then say well business is crap. Realise your odds of success are very low, especially when starting out. My first business failed and I have had two more fail since then, this is the cost of doing business. I have started 10 businesses so far and 7 of them have been successful. I attribute the success of beating the odds (so far) to educating myself and finding my passion.\n   6.\n\n      When investing in a business (say shares etc) you are investing in the management and skills of the people in the team not the product (its about 80% team and 20% product). For an example, look at the Hoola Hoop, it was just a piece of hose, but the management created a sensation. Saying this sometimes you can invest in the product and management 50/50, see how to get super rich below.\n   7.\n\n      Remember that nothing worth having comes easy. Working hard on something you are not passionate about is hard. When you have found your passion it will make the 100 hour weeks seem like 50 hour weeks.\n   8.\n\n      Write business plans, hundreds of them is a start. Your first ones will be hundreds of pages long, but as you write more of them you will get better at it. I can now write a business plan on a whiteboard in 10 minutes for an extremely complex business or investment.\n\nRealise that being financially free requires re-education. You have been taught to work for someone else from when you were a child to most likely today. You were probably never taught by the school system on how to treat money. If you want to be finically free you must invest in education for yourself. I am not talking about going to school, how is someone who is a wage earner (the teacher) going to teach you how to invest to be financially free? You must learn from investors and business people. When I say invest in educating yourself I mean borrow or buy a couple of books to give you a starting point (read from 1 - 4):\n\n   1. Richest Man in Babylon\n   2. Rich Dad, Poor Dad (read the other 3 of Roberts books if you want to know more)\n   3. The E-myth\n   4. Seven Habits of highly effective people.\n\nThese books might cost you $100 to buy and will help solidify your knowledge. Some will seem elementary, but never knock back knowledge, even if you only get 5% from a book.\n\nIf you want to get really rich then you need to move from the basics I discussed above to a whole different ball game.\n\nGetting super rich is not that hard, it just takes a whole lot more hard work, lots of practice, money and knowing where to invest.\n\nIf you look at the people who are super rich they got there by:\n\n   1. Inventing something people want - Bill Gates\n   2. Getting into the resources sector - Any Mining Magnate\n   3. Being in business where people give you your main input for free (paper, cardboard, waste management) - Visy Packaging\n   4. Real Estate - Any large land developer\n\nThe most important thing to realise about these investments is that they are out of reach of most people. When you get more competition in an industry the ROI drops. You will notice above that none of the above investments have much competition. This is why the people who own these are super rich. The businesses that are successful are businesses who supply things that people have to buy but the barriers to entry are so high that competition is low. As an example when was the last time (just before you turned on your light switch) you called the mine that supplies the coal to the power plant that you buy your power from to ask them if you could get a better deal on the coal you were about to burn???? No one ever does that and this is why these businesses are successful.\n\nA good example of something which is never going to make you supper rich is small scale real estate development. Buying houses and renting them produces almost no return on investment in the long run. This is because there are so many people out there willing to get paid almost nothing for their investment in the house of apartment that its very hard to make money. I know some people will disagree and some people have already posted about how much they have made doing this, but I am not talking about ROI's near the risk free rate, I am talking about real investment returns of 15% and above per annum and these returns are not on paper (capital growth).\n\nWhen you want to move to getting super rich, you often don't need all of the money to make it happen. You need a proven track record (in business and investment) and a very good investment opportunity that falls within the 4 above investment areas. People with money are always looking to make it work for them, so they will invest in YOU (see point 5 above) and the opportunity.\n\nI really hoped that helps someone[.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d1x9c/are_you_rich_if_so_how_did_you_get_there/c0wzhlx)\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long time reader, but this issue is very close to my heart so I signed up in the hope that I may help someone to be financially free or find the next big thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am 31 and own 7 different companies (with various investors).

A truck hauling whole tree lumber had blown a tire, flipped into the intersection, and shotgun blasted the road and half the strip mall with trees.\nIn trying to control and clean up the consequential car accidents that followed, the police had unknowingly blocked all the entrances and exits to the strip mall. Seeing that I was blocked in, and wanting to freshen up for class, I decided to get some breath mints from the grocery store in the strip mall.\n\nMentos, my old friend. Before, you were cola rocket fuel, you were indeed the fresh maker.\n\nAfter leaving the grocery store, I look around and see that all the normal exits are still blocked. It's getting closer to the time school starts and I don't want to lose my newly gained vehicular freedom for being tardy, so I walk behind the grocery store to see if the loading entrance was also blocked. Bingo! I could simply drive out that back alley loading area to get back to the street! Problem is, the only way to the back alley is over a well traveled sidewalk and through a dirt lot next to the grocery store.\n\nNo problem. My car is a V6 steel beast, and I'm minty fresh.\n\nI get in my car and slowly drive to the sidewalk. Motionless rubberneckers clutter my path, all they can see is the horrible accident at the intersection. After a couple of beeps from my horn, and some terrible charades on my part, they move aside and watch as I make their day even stranger by driving over the sidewalk.\n\nI slowly drive through the dirt lot as to not kick up a lot of dust and turn the corner to the back alley. I'm all smiles making my way behind the grocery store. Just as I'm about to exit the alley, I hear a cop siren. A cruiser pulls into the entrance of the alley, completely blocking my exit.\n\nThe cop exits his car and approaches my window. I swear it looks like he was walking 10 miles in slow motion, it took him so long. I'm thinking the worst. Reckless driving, public endangerment, getting yelled at by my mom.\n\nHe knocks at my window. I roll it down, my eyes averting his stone gaze. \"Son, what do you think you're doing?\"\n\nThen, suddenly it hit me. This rhetorical question from a figure of authority awakened some slumbering teenage stupidity deep inside of me. I acted quickly reaching to my passenger side seat.\nHe reaches his hand back to his gun, unclipping it from his holster. Pointing it towards the roof, I pull up my Mentos ...and wink. He stares. I keep smiling... keep smiling... a crack in his demeanor appears.\n\"Alright\" he asks. \"From the looks of it, I'm guessing this is the only way out of here?\" \"Yes, sir\" I reply. He casually takes the Mentos from my hand. He puts one in his mouth. \"You're lucky I didn't shoot you.\" I look down in shame. \"I know it was pretty stupid, but you have to admit...\" \"Yeah\" he responds. \"That's probably the funniest thing I've seen all day..\" \"I'm keeping your mints, but you can go.\" \"Thank you officer!\" I respond.\n\nMy friends did not believe me.\n\nTL;DR: I pulled [a classic Mentos Commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLccCsTGNP4) on a cop in real life and he was minty fresh about it[.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fh5pc/i_was_trolled_by_the_police_hard_whats_your_best/c1fx481)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In high school we once had an out of place half day that required us to be in class at 11am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the year 2000, I&amp;#39;m 16, conditioned to wake up early, and just got my drivers license.

I got it (ordered online from their website) during a time when my girlfriend and I were not able to be together much. I don't cheat on women so seeing other girls was out of the question, but I wanted to have some fun. Long story short, I did not regret the purchase. Since it was a relatively tough decision for me to buy it, I will humor you and give a full disclosure of my experience.\n\nI purchased a real Fleshlight with a vagina shaped orifice and the inside was the \"STU\" or stamina training unit. As far as how it affected my stamina with real sex goes, I don't think it really made a difference, even when I was actively trying to delay ejaculation. Despite this, I would pick the same type of fleshlight if I were to buy again. The STU has large and relatively flat bumps on the interior, which I thought was the best option. The material is incredibly soft and stretchy, well beyond what you're imagining. I needed a shit load of lube (astroglide) every time I used the thing. Otherwise, it just feels wrong. So make sure you pick up plenty of lube; it won't go to waste.\n\nIn a way, it is like superhuman sex. And I am not using hyperbole. I mean exactly what I am saying. It is somehow beyond human sex yet not what you'd experience during real sex. I will explain below.\n\nDuring a female orgasm, the vagina contracts as you thrust, which feels quite good as the smooth muscular walls of the vagina create semi-firm circular ridges that stroke your penis, and the tighter the vagina, the more you can feel these ridges' stroking action. Experiencing sex during a female orgasm is more or less the best case scenario when it comes to vaginal sex. Moreover, there is the (assumed) physical attraction, weight (i.e. resistive force during thrusting and something to hold on to), as well as someone holding on to you, heat (normal human body temperature), sounds, smells of your partner, probably some adrenaline, a little sweat, and emotional attachment, which all contribute to the pleasure of normal human sex. At least 6 out of 7 days of the week, I would prefer normal human sex.\n\nThe STU, on the other hand, is like one of the most awesome and unreal feelings that your penis, (but your penis alone), can experience. Compared to the experiences of normal sex, the fleshlight has no weight to it, meaning you have to stroke it up and down (more on this later). The vagina shape is a decent visual aid, but it is nothing like looking at an attractive woman. Porn could help with that, but I don't exactly have an immersive porn watching setup, just a 22\" widescreen monitor. One of the surreal things about it is the heat. You can use it at room temp, but it feels much better if you warm it up in hot tap water. Usually what I would do was start up a porn vid, fill up the sink with hot tap water, also run some hot tap water through the hole, then let the thing float around for about 4-5 min while I watch some porn, lube up the fleshlight liberally with my hand, and then I'd be erect from watching the porn and it would be ready. Usually, I find that a bit too hot is a lot better than too cold. Just be careful.\n\nAs far as sounds go, the thing sounds fucking terrible, unless you unscrew the bottom cap entirely in which case it is silent. But then you are likely to drip some lube on the ground. The case is not a perfect design. If you want suction, you can insert your penis with the cap open, then close the cap, and bam: mega suction. The suction lowers the pressure inside the fleshlight, which makes your penis a bit fuller for the duration of the suction.\n\nSmells: there is a faint silicone smell, and then if you don't treat it properly, you will get a little bit of mildew smell as well. I think most people get the mildew smell because they put it away without fully drying it out, because let's face it, most people don't want to see this thing sitting on your dish rack to dry. I *ALWAYS*\\ washed it with hand soap (not dish soap) before every use, and I never got any weird fungus or any problems with my penis. It is just a smell, get over it. It goes away if your hand soap smells good.\n\nNow for the masturbation. Since the fleshlight has no weight behind it, you can't grab it like a woman and fuck it up and down on your bed or desk chair. You are limited in the number of positions. It cannot kneel. And so on. It really still seems like masturbation in essence, yet it is somehow more. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It is a good thing because it can do things that your hand and a vagina cannot. For one, it can rotate. You can fuck it at interesting / extreme angles that wouldn't work in a vagina or with a hand. It feels slightly different if you fuck it clit-up or clit-down. And you can do all of this without making your girlfriend very confused as to what you're trying to accomplish. It's a toy, so play with it.\n\nHowever, there is still the issue of manually stroking. Manually stroking gives you lots of control, and it's a lot less physically demanding than having sex, so you can get nearly perfect control over your performance. But, it still feels like you are just stroking your dick, albeit with something that feels incredibly awesome. You will probably have to lube up a couple of times more if you go at it for as long as I did, but it is nice not having to get lube all over your hands.\n\nI tried many ways to brace it with something so I could stop feeling like I was just stroking my penis and finally feel like I was fucking a vagina. After many attempts, one method worked thousands of times better than anything else. I have a normal height bed/mattress (frame+box spring+mattress), this probably won't work unless you do too. I just braced it between my mattress and my box spring. It was the perfect height for fucking somewhat reminiscent of doggy style. Then, I simply knelt down on a towel and finally I could thrust my pelvis to my heart's content, watching porn and having a blast.\n\nNow, unlike with a woman, you can thrust it as fast, as slow, as hard, or as soft as you want, and you don't have to worry about how anyone feels but yourself. The biggest concern you have is how long you want to last before you ejaculate. And with this thing, you can really tease the everliving fuck out of your penis and practically give yourself blue balls. When you're thrusting, yeah, it feels good. It feels a little too good, I will admit. It is so much more intense than a vagina because of those broad and flat bumps. It is no substitute for the real thing, but it is nice to know that in a way it is actually better than a vagina.\n\nFinally, when you're ready to ejaculate, it is a bit like a thousand angels' fingers stroking your penis rapidly, like you're fucking a vagina that's on overdrive, or if you're using some suction, like 100 blow jobs at once. Your penis will get incredibly sensitive. More sensitive than it has probably ever been in your entire life. And you have to make that critical decision, are you going to keep stroking? It can be a little too intense to keep going. When I am having sex, I do an internal cumshot 99% of the time. And since my girlfriend and I are monogamous, I never use a condom. Yet, a vagina is never going to feel too intense to keep thrusting during your orgasm, even riding bareback.\n\nI hope it's understood what I'm talking about here. I'm sure all you men have experienced this during masturbation... the point at which you are coming and you have to decide whether you're going to focus on massaging the shaft and sort of \"squeezing out semen\" (i.e. tight fist, ), or if you are going to keep a looser fist and continue stroking the tip of your penis and ride out the intense waves of hypersensitivity, that feeling that in a sense feels so good but it kinda feels bad at the same time. For me, an orgasm is usually a bit more pleasurable with the former, but the orgasm lasts almost 2-3x as long with the latter, concomitant with the production of more semen. With the STU, it's this hyper-intense feeling times 100,000.\n\nI mean let's face it. You will never experience this feeling with a woman, especially not with vaginal sex. Maybe if she is adept at giving the world's most perfect blow job, she kicks the BJ into high gear while you orgasm (gobbling your semen up like it's the Great Depression), and meanwhile manipulates her tongue as if it were as agile as all 10 fingers.\n\nAfter you experience this for the first time, you won't regret any of the prep or care that goes into owning and using a fleshlight, although if you have roommates it is not going to be too easy to hide. You might as well just let them know you have it so they can quickly get over how funny it is. Just keep it out in the open. Soon enough they will be curious. They will probably end up wanting one, especially if you carry yourself with confidence.\n\nI don't own it anymore, at some point I decided it was getting a bit too beat up from all the washing. (I think the soap is the biggest killer) and if I really wanted another one, I'd just buy it. But lately, my girlfriend has been around a lot and we fuck sufficiently, so I don't really feel like I need another one at this time.\n\nIf you are single, there is no reason not to own one. It is one of the greatest experiences your penis can have outside of an actual woman. And for this, the price is negligible. It is the cost of like one or two dates. I would never ever ever go without either a steady girlfriend to fuck or a fleshlight. It is so much better than manual masturbation, you just have to experience it to believe it.\n\nSorry for the long post, I didn't really intend to keep writing this much.\n\n**TL;DR** - You should buy one. If you are single, it's not even a question in my mind. Buy one. And the best thing to do is wedge it between your mattress and box spring[.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aoh8d/the_fleshlight_who_has_one/c0impj7)\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had one.

It is no substitute for the real thing, but it is nice to know that in a way it is actually better than a vagina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you&amp;#39;re ready to ejaculate, it is a bit like a thousand angels&amp;#39; fingers stroking your penis rapidly, like you&amp;#39;re fucking a vagina that&amp;#39;s on overdrive, or if you&amp;#39;re using some suction, like 100 blow jobs at once. Your penis will get incredibly sensitive. More sensitive than it has probably ever been in your entire life. And you have to make that critical decision, are you going to keep stroking? It can be a little too intense to keep going. When I am having sex, I do an internal cumshot 99% of the time. And since my girlfriend and I are monogamous, I never use a condom. Yet, a vagina is never going to feel too intense to keep thrusting during your orgasm, even riding bareback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope it&amp;#39;s understood what I&amp;#39;m talking about here. I&amp;#39;m sure all you men have experienced this during masturbation... the point at which you are coming and you have to decide whether you&amp;#39;re going to focus on massaging the shaft and sort of &amp;quot;squeezing out semen&amp;quot; (i.e. tight fist, ), or if you are going to keep a looser fist and continue stroking the tip of your penis and ride out the intense waves of hypersensitivity, that feeling that in a sense feels so good but it kinda feels bad at the same time. For me, an orgasm is usually a bit more pleasurable with the former, but the orgasm lasts almost 2-3x as long with the latter, concomitant with the production of more semen. With the STU, it&amp;#39;s this hyper-intense feeling times 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean let&amp;#39;s face it. You will never experience this feeling with a woman, especially not with vaginal sex. Maybe if she is adept at giving the world&amp;#39;s most perfect blow job, she kicks the BJ into high gear while you orgasm (gobbling your semen up like it&amp;#39;s the Great Depression), and meanwhile manipulates her tongue as if it were as agile as all 10 fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you experience this for the first time, you won&amp;#39;t regret any of the prep or care that goes into owning and using a fleshlight, although if you have roommates it is not going to be too easy to hide. You might as well just let them know you have it so they can quickly get over how funny it is. Just keep it out in the open. Soon enough they will be curious. They will probably end up wanting one, especially if you carry yourself with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t own it anymore, at some point I decided it was getting a bit too beat up from all the washing. (I think the soap is the biggest killer) and if I really wanted another one, I&amp;#39;d just buy it. But lately, my girlfriend has been around a lot and we fuck sufficiently, so I don&amp;#39;t really feel like I need another one at this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are single, there is no reason not to own one. It is one of the greatest experiences your penis can have outside of an actual woman. And for this, the price is negligible. It is the cost of like one or two dates. I would never ever ever go without either a steady girlfriend to fuck or a fleshlight. It is so much better than manual masturbation, you just have to experience it to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, I didn&amp;#39;t really intend to keep writing this much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; - You should buy one. If you are single, it&amp;#39;s not even a question in my mind. Buy one. And the best thing to do is wedge it between your mattress and box spring&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aoh8d/the_fleshlight_who_has_one/c0impj7\"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_gdi70", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/gdi70/have_you_ever_used_a_fleshlight_or_other_brand_of/c1mrx2f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gdi70/have_you_ever_used_a_fleshlight_or_other_brand_of/", "name": "t1_c1mrx2f", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1301357819.0, "created_utc": 1301357819.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gdi70/have_you_ever_used_a_fleshlight_or_other_brand_of/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Tell me your worst interview story!!", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c1mq2q0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "RepostCommentThief", "num_comments": 71, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gd8jb", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_47169", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Probably one of my biggest fails at an interview:\n\nCouldn't find the building, had to call reception to direct me - arrived late, sweaty, flustered.\n\nI have a stutter that can be a problem on the best of days, let alone when I'm nervous.
