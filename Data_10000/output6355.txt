At the same though, at what point do we as a country bite the bullet &amp; say enough is enough, i get trying to get in on this, the govt is basically handing out free money so  if you have loans why wouldn't you or i want some of that? its human nature but some of us busted our asses to either pay off these loans or worked hard so we didn't have to take out the loans to begin with, some of us joined the military and had to deal with things that most of these college grads couldn't imagine to pay for our schooling when we got out. Why should the tax dollars of some high school grad trades men pay for the degree of somebody who go their masters or PHD in whatever useless field they chose. They were adults when they agreed and signed those loan papers, nobody forced them and its not like they had no other options, why should they be just forgiven? what precedent is there to just magically forgive all this money people borrowed, that they borrowed knowing full well what they were doing. Honestly if we could stop hemorrhaging money out to other parts of the world cough cough *eastern europe*, then yes we could probably afford to being some type of debt relief to people who cant afford to pay back their loans, but to just give magic blanket forgiveness to everybody who knowingly took out a loan is just nonsensical.\n\nAt what point does everybody in this country wake up and realize that this money the government hands out has to come from somewhere. Like are we at the point yet that the govt decided that we are never getting out of the hole these pigs in the capitol dug for the rest of America? The options are either stop throwing away money by the trillions to Ukraine and wherever else and try to right the ship or just keep it rolling till the wheels fall off and there is not just  a financial collapse the likes of which history has never seen but a total collapse. Just up until 2001 this country wasn't even in massive debt, that 31 trillion dollar number on hat big fucking counter that runs continuously wasnt even there and up until 2016 the federal government wasn't actually spending more than it was taking, at some point the spending has to stop.  How the fuck did we even get ourselves into a mess like this? If people in this country would actually wake up, one of the biggest issues in the next election cycle would be whats going to be done to cut spending and get this country back into the black and stop sending &amp; spending money everywhere else and on anything other than where it needs to be spent.

At the same though, at what point do we as a country bite the bullet &amp;amp; say enough is enough, i get trying to get in on this, the govt is basically handing out free money so  if you have loans why wouldn&amp;#39;t you or i want some of that? its human nature but some of us busted our asses to either pay off these loans or worked hard so we didn&amp;#39;t have to take out the loans to begin with, some of us joined the military and had to deal with things that most of these college grads couldn&amp;#39;t imagine to pay for our schooling when we got out. Why should the tax dollars of some high school grad trades men pay for the degree of somebody who go their masters or PHD in whatever useless field they chose. They were adults when they agreed and signed those loan papers, nobody forced them and its not like they had no other options, why should they be just forgiven? what precedent is there to just magically forgive all this money people borrowed, that they borrowed knowing full well what they were doing. Honestly if we could stop hemorrhaging money out to other parts of the world cough cough &lt;em&gt;eastern europe&lt;/em&gt;, then yes we could probably afford to being some type of debt relief to people who cant afford to pay back their loans, but to just give magic blanket forgiveness to everybody who knowingly took out a loan is just nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At what point does everybody in this country wake up and realize that this money the government hands out has to come from somewhere. Like are we at the point yet that the govt decided that we are never getting out of the hole these pigs in the capitol dug for the rest of America? The options are either stop throwing away money by the trillions to Ukraine and wherever else and try to right the ship or just keep it rolling till the wheels fall off and there is not just  a financial collapse the likes of which history has never seen but a total collapse. Just up until 2001 this country wasn&amp;#39;t even in massive debt, that 31 trillion dollar number on hat big fucking counter that runs continuously wasnt even there and up until 2016 the federal government wasn&amp;#39;t actually spending more than it was taking, at some point the spending has to stop.  How the fuck did we even get ourselves into a mess like this? If people in this country would actually wake up, one of the biggest issues in the next election cycle would be whats going to be done to cut spending and get this country back into the black and stop sending &amp;amp; spending money everywhere else and on anything other than where it needs to be spent.

I've talked about it on here before but here goes, i've had a steady daily habit without missing a day since probably 2013-14 at this point and using since like 2010. At one point maybe like 2-3 years ago i was taking like 40-45 30s a day, usually all in one dose at night and i was functioning fine, get up the next day and go to work without withdrawals starting to kick in untill about 7-8 at night and not taking any pills till probably 9-10 at night and the majority of the time when i was at that point those 40 30s werent really even getting me like nodding off fucked up at night like you'd expect, just kind of feeling good with a little buzz but if i tried to push it and take a few pills more than my normal dose trying to get that old long gone feeling i would feel terrible for the next like 3-4 hours till it wore off a little it was a very fine like to dance around &amp; i'm guessing id just feel so terrible just because of what a huge dose it was and my body and brain trying to process it, that was one of the worst feelings ever. I'd describe it as feeling like disassociated where evrything felt like it kinda wasnt real with my mind racing and at the same time feeling very slow idk how to describe it otherwise, along with sweating and kind of a headache and just feeling kind of nauseous. It was a feeling i had gotten before if i take a too high dose trying to get that old oxy feeling back and i always kinda thought it was combo of low blood sugar from not eating all day long and taking the pills on an empty stomach if i took them like as i was eating \"dinner\".  \n\nThe massive doses i was taking daily only really eventually stopped and i started to reign it in because one night after not eating anything all day, coming home and not really having anything good to eat in the house i ate some leftovers that were sitting out for a few hours which wasn't very good, then taking this huge dose of i think like 75-80 15s, i started to hget that same feeling as i described above but worse than normal wayy worse like just super weird i thought i was gonna have like a stroke or something and as i was standing in my kitchen over the course of like an hour from when it started i went from feeling strange to projectile vomiting the leftovers and the turkey sandwich i just scarfed down thinking i felt weird from low blood sugar and the pills and i ended up being deathly sick for like 3-4 days with what i'm guessing was a norovirus or maybe food poisioning. I couldnt eat anything except for some chicken broth soup for like 2-3 days and even that was a struggle, i couldnt really keep down anything including the pills so it helped reign in my dose which was honestly a huge blessing in disguise cause it helped me start on a path of tapering myself down. This all happened right at the beginning of covid outbreak too like when you were seeing bodies stacked in cooler trucks in NYC cause the morgues were full and i thought i might have COVID so that was not very good for my state of mind either, freaking out not knowing what i had cause there were not really tests yet. So yea i ended up cutting my dose  by more than half over the next few days just because i couldn't keep down any pills. It got so bad   i had to put in an IV line because i couldnt keep down water, and there was no way in hell i was going near a hospital at that point lol, i didnt poop for like 4 days not because i was constipated just because i hadnt eaten anything to poop out lol.\n\nSo yea it is def possible for somebody to wrack up that kind of habit, he said he was on oxy for like 20 years and that dude had wayy better funding that i do, and being a high powered lawyer and county solicitor (basicly outside council for the county who can decide weather or not to prosecute sombody) and his father and grandfather held the same office before him, you can bet your ass this guy was well connected to doctors pharmacists and for sure drug dealers in his area who im sure would have been more than happy to have this guy owe them a favor or just do dirt with him knowing they were kind of protected if it came to that.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;i know im gona get the people who always has to call bullshit but as an anon on the internet i have non reason to make this up, its not somthing im proud of at all and i dont really willungly tell people i ever got this bad.
