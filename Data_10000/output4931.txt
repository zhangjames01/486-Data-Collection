I&amp;#39;ve been on Lexapro for a cpl years now. The reason why is kind of a case study in the shittiness of the US insurance system: at first I had to go to free clinics (where as you probably know are the WORST places for psychiatric treatment) and then when I finally got added back onto my parents&amp;#39; insurance, there was really only one psychiatrist in my area, and he is of a older generation that sniffs out perceived &amp;quot;pill chasers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, since the Lexapro seemed to be managing my debilitating depression, this new psych (who I have seen every 3-6 months for the past two years) has insisted on continuing the Lexapro nightly before bed (because the shit makes me sleepy), and then giving me Klonopin to use as an emergency brake for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which now that I think about it this cocktail doesn&amp;#39;t really do shit for mania after all. The worst part about mania for me is that I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s happening until it&amp;#39;s way too late and I&amp;#39;ve scorched the earth and burned bridges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would go to see the psych right now, but I got dropped from my parents&amp;#39; insurance for the crime of turning 26. And of course, this manic episode at work happened while I&amp;#39;ve been waiting to be able to enroll in my work&amp;#39;s insurance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR dumb sob story, can&amp;#39;t change my meds immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2c3ua1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/bipolar/comments/2c3ua1/bipolar_at_work_do_you_tell/cjbtudj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/2c3ua1/bipolar_at_work_do_you_tell/", "name": "t1_cjbtudj", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bipolar", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1406706431.0, "created_utc": 1406706431.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/2c3ua1/bipolar_at_work_do_you_tell/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnv4", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Repost from \"bipolar at work\" - manic episode at office has nearly cost me my job.
