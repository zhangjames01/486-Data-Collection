In ergonomics and workplace safety research, this is called the \"work as imagined/work as done disconnect.\"\n\nWhy do so many more accidents happen involving autobelays than involving topropes in the gym? It's not that there are more idiots climbing autobelays -- you just lack having another person around to check you when you fuck up. I'd argue that they dangerously blur the line between bouldering and rope climbing: both solo activities that you can just walk up to and start without much thought, but one is much higher consequence. Why don't the blue triangles work all the time? See below\n\nEvery gym I have worked at (and most I've climbed at) permits people to bolder/traverse on the roped climbing areas under some height. Usually ~10 feet or up to the first quickdraw. Some gyms also have autobelay routes that don't start directly under the triangle -- bad practice, but it definitely happens since it's hard to cram the starts to 3-4 routes into a couple feet of space. These two factors can negate what minimal safety features there are like the blue triangles. Though some places have started using large blue tarps to cover a 6 foot wide section at the bottom of autobelays, and that probably is a little better than the blue triangles. \n\nI can easily imagine a scenario where I get five feet up, get distracted, and just continue, forgetting that I never actually clipped in. Brains are weirdly bad at keeping track of this stuff sometimes, and it's why we climb in pairs. Lynn Hill got distracted finishing her knot and cratered from 70 feet. Was she an idiot? No, she just got distracted and she and her partner forgot to check her knot.\n\nI don't fuck with autobelays. It's not that I don't trust them -- rather I don't trust myself to do everything right without someone to correct me. I don't want climbing by myself to be that easy. I occasionally TR solo, but I feel much more aware doing that than climbing an autobelays. \n\nI'm not trying to turn you against autobelays, so you don't need to keep defending them so strongly. You should use them if you want to. I just don't think you should be so dismissive of people who get hurt on them: most people are reasonably intelligent, so it's probably not their character flaws causing all those accidents.", "edited": 1674834163.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "wyoming", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re really falling into the trap of thinking that people who make mistakes and get hurt must be idiots.

Even with an improved presentation, the map still wouldn&amp;#39;t be super enlightening, since punitive policies vary from country to country, and the histories of different immigrant populations vary greatly too (e.g. does the country more severely punish so-called &amp;quot;crimes of poverty&amp;quot; than its neighbors, making prison demographics align more with socioeconomic status, or does it not, making these numbers more representative of something like violent crime?). So even a quality map would not be super informative since so much else determines the prison population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I&amp;#39;ve now checked Germany (turks are the greatest immigrant population), the Netherlands (turks are the largest group, but Morocco is a close second at 419k vs 429k), Norway (Poland then Lithuania, but it seems like none of the marked countries on this map are counted, so I guess the polish population isn&amp;#39;t being considered?) and Poland (Ukrainians are by far the largest foreign-born group). So far, this really is just shaping up to be a map of &amp;quot;which immigrant group is the largest in X country&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can look for yourself on the eu census&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1028k8o", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/MapPorn/comments/1028k8o/most_common_foreign_nationalities_in_prisons_of/j2u21j4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1028k8o/most_common_foreign_nationalities_in_prisons_of/", "name": "t1_j2u21j4", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MapPorn", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1672787596.0, "created_utc": 1672787596.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/e9w3pt3t0u9a1.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2shrf", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Bont chasing that boomer money", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 14, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "BicyclingCirclejerk", "link_author": "ThePrancingHorse94", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j2s55eg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Waldinian", "num_comments": 57, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j2s4481", "score": 14, "author_fullname": "t2_7bw3f", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes and supposedly unbelievably painful.
