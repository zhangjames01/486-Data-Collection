It shouldn't be very expensive or unhealthy at all, but it helps a nagging sweet tooth yearning for a treat.\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n1.  1 cup all purpose flour\n2.  1 tbsp baking powder\n3.  1 cup milk (any is fine, but I use 1.25% homogenized)\n4.  3 egg yolks\n5.  3 egg whites\n6.  Large bowls to mix with, an electric hand-mixer, a non-stick skillet, ladle, and a spatula.\n7.  Chocolate chips or toppings\n\n*Procedure* \n\n1. In a bowl, combine flour and baking powder.  \n2. In two smaller bowls, separate egg yolks from egg whites.\n3. Mix the egg yolks and milk into the flour mixture until it is smooth.\n4.  In a large mixing bowl, use the electric mixer to whip the egg whites until they form peaks and are not runny. (They should be an opaque white)\n5. Fold half of the whipped egg whites into the batter, mix, then fold the other half in.\n6. Using a ladle, pour half a ladle's worth of batter onto your skillet on medium heat.  Grab onto the pan handle and turn it in a way that the batter moves around to become a circle.\n7.  Wait a couple of minutes.  Once the batter has obvious medium-sized bubbles, take your chocolate chips (or chosen toppings) and drop them generously onto the BOTTOM HALF of your crepe.  \n8. Use your spatula and roll up your crepe FROM THE BOTTOM.  This should make perfect crepes with a golden backside and delicious inside.\n\nThis is a great recipe because anyone can vary the toppings to what they choose.  For example, I had a sleepover and made breakfast for my guests.  I used this recipe and did my thang with the chocolate chips, then sliced asian pears and decorated on top, and spooned strawberry syrup on top (which I had made the day before).\n\nThe recipe should make 7-10.  Costs approx. $2~$3, each serving should be about $0.20.\n\nDo you mind if I continue finding and posting recipes? I really appreciate and support sites like these, people really need to learn how to cook for themselves and learn that not all great recipes are too expensive.\n\n", "edited": 1311833502.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a lady who cooks for herself, I&amp;#39;d suggest getting some way to find out intake of certain stats such as calories and cholesterol because even college students care for that kind of stuff.

With children, it's monkey-see, monkey-do.  For example, my father loves reading so, so much.  My parents keep their books everywhere and just read.  In return, growing up, all three children (my sister, brother and I) have an extreme like of reading.  I would finish my homework and then spend hours upon hours on reading fantasy novels that sparked my imagination (most were about dragons).\n\nChallenge their creativity/imagination.  My family started out poor.  My dad was from a poor background and my immediate family is breadwinner.  My mom would take care of us, her three children, aged a few months, 2, and 3.  As we paid off our mortgage, we learned to get accustomed to scrimping.  As a result, my parents never bought me toys.  I always loved to play, so my solution?  I made my own.  I made boats out of empty shampoo bottles and I would create a pretend tiny cafe in my backyard with water, dirt, and a stick.\n\nWhen your children are at the age that they can walk and are eager to make their own decisions, do not be afraid to let them experiment with things (Granted that they are not hazardous).  Because my parents let me experiment with things, I learned about subjects myself such as buoyancy, changes of matter's state and just small things such as liquids being able to change to the shape of their container.\n\nBuoyancy - I was able to make my own toys and learned that they floated in my bathtub filled with water.  This always happened so I concluded that the toy is lighter than the water.\n\nChanges of a matter's state - I would find a plastic container and play with it.  I'd spend hours in my bathroom playing with containers and water, using my own imagination as fun-fuel.  My mother would always ask me, what are you doing? I'd reply with, \"I'm playing.\"  She'd say, \"Alright, as long as you clean up after.\" One day I filled a container with water and put it in my freezer.  I found out that the cold made water turn hard, but the warmth made it softer and softer.\n\nLiquids flowing to the shape of their container - While getting out of the tub after a bath, I realized that the water was dripping off my body and onto the floor.  I took a little bit more water and placed it on the slightly lowered product that binds the floor tiles together (I forgot what it's called.)  The water would flow only according to those lines because the tiles acted as walls.  I learned that liquids change their shape to where it's contained.\n\nI also never really got in trouble for any of these (even purposely putting water on the floor) because my parents raised me to know that I am responsible for my own actions.  Please teach your children that! \n\nThis thread warms my heart.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start off, this is a 15 year old lady&amp;#39;s opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post is amazing.
