To begin with I'm going to drop the whole 'my friend' because when we're talking about your friends and it makes it confusing to read and write, and this isn\u2019t anything illegal; so forgive me. You remind me of myself a good 7yrs ago or so - you sound introspective and intelligent, so I'll just give you a bit of advice from my own experience and a few perspectives to think about. I feel like the older you get there are less right and wrong answers and more shades of grey - I feel like this is the case here. \n\nFirstly, the negatively. I found this same problem when I was in high school - most of the things I felt like I talked about with my friends was on the whole negative, depressing and I felt it affected me a lot. In Hindsight what was actually happening was I was entering a darker/moodier (maybe depressive phase) which can often happen in puberty on purely a hormonal level. What I perceived as the group being negative had probably more to do with me \"picking up\" and paying attention to more of the negativity. It was affecting me more than it had before because I was already primed for that energy. Due to the depression (or mood whatever you want to call it) I too felt like withdrawing. A lot of your account has feelings of withdrawal, negativity, hopelessness, helplessness, apathy and you mention you feel drained of empathy - it could be that its something to do with you more then your friend group. Its often unreliable to think the world is as we perceive it. Now of course I could be wrong, you will know better then I will - its just a perspective to consider. Definitely don\u2019t trust a internet stranger to tell you these things, just keep an open mind. If its the case ask your parents if they have noticed changes like that in you, consider seeing a psychologist or councillor. It maybe they\u2019re not the cause of your declining mental health - maybe it is - just an idea. \n\n\nTo add on to the above - I think adolescents just complain a lot. Days are pretty repetitive; there isn't much in terms of new/exciting things to do each week in comparison to the amount of test, pressure and social pressures that get put on you. Also you come out of the innocence of childhood and start realising that life isn't as fantastic as you were told growing up. There is existential dread and angst now. When you look at bands with a strong teenage cult following through any generation, they all paint the same mood; nirvana, smashing pumpkins, the wombats, greenday, sex pistols. So maybe it wouldnt change regardless of who your friends with, it also creates a lot of bonding which make them long term friends.\n\n\nFinally, the food. I dont see this as a huge sign of disrespect. More as boys just seeing how far they can go and where the line is. You've just got to be firm, hold your line and they'll respect it. A lot of teenage guy behaviour is about a 'pecking order' that is unaviodable and something you identify with yourself (\"OG members of the group\"). Just stand your ground - if they start carrying on about not getting food then pick at their arguments one by one and avoid saying \"you all do this\" - the best way to destroy a group mentality is to defend yourself individually. If you try and attack the group each individual member will hide their responsibility, individually hold them accountable and they have no way to hide. \n\n\nAll the best OP. I really do mean it. Consider that it could be a combination of things as opposed to anything purposefully dishonest; like emotional manipulation unless they\u2019re all psychopaths that seems unlikely. Also consider that mental illness affects the way you perceive things and understand the world. If it is the case try and stay with your friends and resist the urge to withdraw. This has happened twice to me before, In high school I wasn\u2019t allowed to withdraw (god bless my friends), later when it happened to me at university I had that freedom to withdrawal and it made the illness that much worse and harder to get out of.
