Until I came to the end where it says that you signed a Lease which states that you are responsible for the property's landscaping needs!  I've NEVER heard of that before.  That canNOT be a standard, Office Depot type of Lease form, is it?  Must be something she had written up. \n\nBut here's the deal as I see it -- \"The Tenant is responsible for maintenance of the yard yada yada .. \" is simply too undefined. It provides the elements for legalistic arguing surrounding issues of what \"you must do..\" .. but what it lacks are the key essentials defining your responsibilities.  That is, 1 - Exactly how many hours a week/month do you 'owe' her? What is your exact obligation? Is it limitless?  It can't be \"as many as it takes .. since there is nearly ALways further work that 'could' be done by a perfectionists standards! (was a landscape gardener for decades). 2 - What is the agreed-upon upper limit of your financial obligations, in tending to the landscaping? Again, there MUST be a limit to it!    These are the 'vital details' that the two of you apparently failed to clarify prior to your assuming tenancy -- but NOT having pre-established them, as I see it, only invites confict going forward. \nBut to answer your asked questions more simply and directly: No, in my view it is definitely NOT something you should be expected to pay for.  Yes, I believe that your view is correct that she should pay for any equipment rental, and there should be some [clearly defined] lessening of your rent for the work performed.\nYou definitely have a problem though -- pre-defining the terms of a contract, precisely, is the action which pre-negates later disagreements and confusion, (and, sometimes, anger and bitterness).  You two apparently neglected to take care of that before entering into your current living arrangement.  So now, whatchya gonna do??!  Hopefully she'll see and be able to admit that you BOTH entered into a trouble-fostering contract --\n but that's not what I'm really 'getting' from you.  Best of luck on this!  Hope this helps at least as an outside view.

Until I came to the end where it says that you signed a Lease which states that you are responsible for the property&amp;#39;s landscaping needs!  I&amp;#39;ve NEVER heard of that before.  That canNOT be a standard, Office Depot type of Lease form, is it?  Must be something she had written up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the deal as I see it -- &amp;quot;The Tenant is responsible for maintenance of the yard yada yada .. &amp;quot; is simply too undefined. It provides the elements for legalistic arguing surrounding issues of what &amp;quot;you must do..&amp;quot; .. but what it lacks are the key essentials defining your responsibilities.  That is, 1 - Exactly how many hours a week/month do you &amp;#39;owe&amp;#39; her? What is your exact obligation? Is it limitless?  It can&amp;#39;t be &amp;quot;as many as it takes .. since there is nearly ALways further work that &amp;#39;could&amp;#39; be done by a perfectionists standards! (was a landscape gardener for decades). 2 - What is the agreed-upon upper limit of your financial obligations, in tending to the landscaping? Again, there MUST be a limit to it!    These are the &amp;#39;vital details&amp;#39; that the two of you apparently failed to clarify prior to your assuming tenancy -- but NOT having pre-established them, as I see it, only invites confict going forward. \nBut to answer your asked questions more simply and directly: No, in my view it is definitely NOT something you should be expected to pay for.  Yes, I believe that your view is correct that she should pay for any equipment rental, and there should be some [clearly defined] lessening of your rent for the work performed.\nYou definitely have a problem though -- pre-defining the terms of a contract, precisely, is the action which pre-negates later disagreements and confusion, (and, sometimes, anger and bitterness).  You two apparently neglected to take care of that before entering into your current living arrangement.  So now, whatchya gonna do??!  Hopefully she&amp;#39;ll see and be able to admit that you BOTH entered into a trouble-fostering contract --\n but that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m really &amp;#39;getting&amp;#39; from you.
