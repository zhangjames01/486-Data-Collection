If the consequences were always what they should be, you'd either have a very high turn-over among main characters (not necessarily bad, but a more recent fashion in TV story-telling) or main characters who consistently act to protect their careers.\n\nThat said, this works better as a conceit when treated consistently. I can accept Starfleet officers being rewarded for ignoring orders, for instance, because the institutional culture of Starfleet emphasizes independent action when one has superior situational awareness, as well as having an expectation that members of Starfleet will refuse an illegal or unethical order in situ. This later expectation appears to be legally enforced, no less, since not only do we see Picard first refuse orders from, and then arrest, flag officers on at least two occasions, but we also see Riker sent to the brig for failing to refuse an illegal order. It might not be realistic in terms of Starfleet being an effective paramilitary organization, but it at least paints Starfleet as having a set of behavioral norms that officers are expected to comply with that we can see being formally and informally enforced.\n\nI think your other example, though, does a good job of illustrating how this can be unsatisfying when the writers don't treat it with due care. The plot of Wrath of Khan required, to my mind, that Enterprise be crippled because the entire conceit of the climax is that this isn't Kirk's first rodeo and when he's on his A game Khan simply can't compete with his skill as a starship captain. That's fine, it's what made the movie exciting. The problem is that in order to cripple Enterprise they had Kirk make an error that both undermines the suspension of disbelief (as you say, who would place him back in command of anything after all of the deaths his mistake lead to, and of cadets no less), but it fundamentally undermines the whole premise that Kirk's performance in the chair is so hot that not even Khan's super-intelligence is a match.\n\nI guess I don't disagree that some of the silly behaviors that Starfleet exhibits as an organization are symptomatic of the writers having no military experience and not having done their homework, but I think the majority are produced by the writers wanting to tell stories that well written and properly followed regulations would prevent from the outset. I can't blame you for not being satisfied with \"Starfleet is not a military organization and doesn't follow military norms\" as an explanation for these behaviors, though, given how widely varying the demonstrations of how and why this should be so are in terms of consistency and depth.", "edited": 1507309944.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "EngEnsign", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think part of it is that even the writers who do know how things work are bound by some narrative constraints; to have stories that explore certain themes about the potential clash of authority, rules, ethics and morality they sometimes have to place characters in a position to engage in what should be career-ending behavior.

You know how throwing up usually make you feel better when it&amp;#39;s like that? Nope. My side, which had twinged a little any time I coughed throughout the day and evening, was now agonizing, and I now knew that it was time to go to the emergency room, and told my girlfriend as much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out that that sneeze had come at a time when my torso was particularly tense after coughing, and the force of my giant awesome body fighting against itself tore a small hole my abdomen, after which the hematoma that was forming in there produced enough pressure that I vomited, tearing a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; hole in my abdomen. Fortunately it wasn&amp;#39;t severe enough to warrant surgical intervention, so this story ends with the anticlimax of me being pumped full of paint meds and then trying not to bend my torso for two weeks, which is surprisingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_63ozeb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/63ozeb/what_made_you_go_from_meh_to_oh_crap_i_need_to/dfwnzbg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/63ozeb/what_made_you_go_from_meh_to_oh_crap_i_need_to/", "name": "t1_dfwnzbg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1491484710.0, "created_utc": 1491484710.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/63ozeb/what_made_you_go_from_meh_to_oh_crap_i_need_to/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vi0z", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Eastern Screech-Owls are most commonly found in two morphs (or colors): red morph and gray morph.

The fact that the civilian government is officially horrified by the idea that Section 31 might exist is symptomatic of the same military/civil balance problem that the Federation appears to suffer from due to the continued insistence that Starfleet isn't a military: the Federation government's \"principled\" insistence that the Federation maintains no military has resulted in an obviously military organization that also oversees a large number of non-military state functions, and has also created an intelligence agency with no apparent oversight by the ostensibly governing body.\n\nIdeals aren't a suicide pact, and the acknowledgement that the Federation's very real preferences for peace and diplomatic amity don't necessarily signify in the face of a powerful competitor with differing ideas of how the universe should work is one of the most fascinating things about Deep Space 9.
