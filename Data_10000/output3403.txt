whom the word 'government' is a bad thing. \n\nThe type of people who once heard Reagan's \"The scariest phrase is I'm from the government and I'm here to help\" and unquestionably believe it to be true. The problem isn't necessarily education, though once you scratch past some initial beliefs generally there is some level of ignorance or misinformation on how government operates (ex.] The idea that if I get a raise this year, it bumps my tax bracket on my entire income), but that is part of it.\n\nThe larger part, I think and we saw this with the COVID pandemic, is a general increase in people who just generally don't want to be told what to do...at least explicitly. The 'rugged individualist' type who believes that at the end of the day, they should be allowed to do what they want and when they want. This was a mindset that was fostered heavily in the 80s due to figures like Reagan, Thatcher, and Mulroney who pumped up a lot of the new-wave Neoliberal Conservativism that created many of the talking points still used today (ex.] Trickle-down economics, 'starve the beast', etc.)\n\nThis mindset was already there but this push on the economic front arguably created a generation that took the next step: It went from government shouldn't tell you how to spend your money/aka government should tax you less, to a full embrace of 'government should leave you alone.' A good example is every time any province tries to modernize sex education in the schools; the predominant right-wing rebuttal is that 'parents should choose what is good for their children'.\n\nYou could even see this with some of Harper's boutique tax credits; where the argument was letting 'families' keep more money from their taxes that they could decide how to spend. \n\nIt's been decades of messaging that people know better than government how to spend their money, and this messaging predates Reagan and his lot but they definitely lit the fuse we deal with today, and it was only a matter of time before this group went from \"government leave my money\" to \"government leave\". There isn't much thought about what comes after...or what replaces, there's just this fundamental hatred and mistrust of the initial institution that many of these types would 'side with the Devil himself' over what they perceive to be a worse evil.\n\nFundamentally, this crop has been growing for years. It's been fertilized (heavily) and now it's finally ripe to be harvested...Sadly, I don't know how you reach someone who has bought in so heavily to the concept over the last few years, or decades, in their life; at least, not until after the damage is done and they're affected by it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is fundamentally a group of people to whom the word &amp;#39;government&amp;#39; is a bad thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The type of people who once heard Reagan&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;The scariest phrase is I&amp;#39;m from the government and I&amp;#39;m here to help&amp;quot; and unquestionably believe it to be true.
