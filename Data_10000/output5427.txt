If there is no evidence of it and no mention of it whatsoever then why do you think an apocalypse has happened? Are you basing this solely off of Road Warrior, which is obviously apocalyptic? There is a 5 year gap between the two movies which is more than enough time for Australia to get nuked by the Soviets, remember this was made in the cold war. With nukes destroying most of the worlds civilization in that 5 year period obviously international trade has been interrupted, hence the depletion of oil.\n\nMad max is not apocalyptic and was never intended to be. It is dystopian, society still exists and functions it is just crime ridden, corrupt, and shitty. This movie is a Dytopian Western film, replace the typical bandits with the motercylce gang, Mel Gibson is the Clint Eastwood esque character who's life is destroyed causing him to go on a revenge fueled rampage.  In western films there is still law and order of a sort it is simply difficult for the few law men that exist to cover the massive ammount of land in their jurasdiction, hence the police in MM seeming completely undermanned and underequiped. Society still exists though, which explains why his wife behaves as such, there are still cities filled with people, there is no oil shortage, oil is somewhat scarce in the area due to them being in the middle of nowhere, not due to an actual shortage. If you simply read the wiki page for the movie the very first line read \"Mad Max is a 1979 Australian dystopian action film directed by George Miller\" then in the first line of the plot description \"In a dystopic future Australia, law and order has begun to break down.\" Key word there is begun, law and order has not yet broken down and is still intact. The police force of the country is simply finding it harder and harder to keep order as time moves foreward. Think of it more like Detroit in the modern day, Australia is simply fallen on a bad times and so the crime rate spikes up and police budgets have to be cut.\n\ntl;dr the only reason you don't like this film is based on an incorrect assumption about it's setting that is based solely on the setting of the sequel.", "edited": 1413303480.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I feel like this is a fairly obvious question but why is it you think this film is post apocalyptic? If there is no evidence of it and no mention of it whatsoever then why do you think an apocalypse has happened? Are you basing this solely off of Road Warrior, which is obviously apocalyptic? There is a 5 year gap between the two movies which is more than enough time for Australia to get nuked by the Soviets, remember this was made in the cold war. With nukes destroying most of the worlds civilization in that 5 year period obviously international trade has been interrupted, hence the depletion of oil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mad max is not apocalyptic and was never intended to be. It is dystopian, society still exists and functions it is just crime ridden, corrupt, and shitty. This movie is a Dytopian Western film, replace the typical bandits with the motercylce gang, Mel Gibson is the Clint Eastwood esque character who&amp;#39;s life is destroyed causing him to go on a revenge fueled rampage.
