With that said higher fidelity does have higher requirements, that's how it works, the fact that the higher fidelity on resi5 has higher requirements than 4 is a detriment only to people who cannot afford the hardware, but if you are so poor that you cannot afford to run such an old game maybe you shouldn't be playing games and work a little more, and I don't mean that in a condescending way, but honestly 5 runs on a potato, the mt framework is a solid engine after all.
