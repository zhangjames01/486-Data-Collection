OP, I think the deck you want to emulate here is less the iconic RW Slide-Rift deck from Onslaught-era Standard, and more Julien Nuijten\u2019s GW Slide-Witness deck that won Worlds during the peak of Ravager Affinity. I would go look that list up for reference, as well as examine what it was beating in that Top 8. (https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/694313#paper)\n\nI don\u2019t know the Legacy meta well enough to say whether Rift is viable. But I do think that with a proper mana setup, slide/flicker effects with 3-4 Eternal Witness should be able to grind out very impressive value. The importance of Witness in Slide is that it always lets you get at least your cycler back, or a better one from an earlier turn, which means you should never run dry\u2014and your 2/1 should almost never die\u2014unless they have perfectly timed interaction.\n\nWith that going on as well as creatures that produce metagame-relevant ETB and/or LTB triggers, you should be able to put together a toolbox-y deck with a wide suite of answers. (In the case of GW Slide at Worlds, it was all about recurring Viridian Shamans against Affinity, and recurring Witness for Oxidizes against them and other answers for everything else.)\n\n(Minor correction: What I said about Oxidize is true, but not quite as true as it was for UG ConTroll, a dedicated Block hate deck built on similar principles to this using Troll Ascetic to back up a mountain of Witness+Oxidize and Viridian Shamans, all in the maindeck, with Crystal Shard as the recursion engine. Deck had like a 99.99% win rate against Affinity in my experience but only did okay against the rest of the field because of dead cards and Crystal dying to Oxidize itself. https://www.mtgsalvation.com/articles/16450-ug-control-in-type-ii)\n\nI definitely think you need more cycling cards, as 9 is only 1 in 7, which is only enough to ensure you see 1 in a game where you\u2019re getting hit hard by aggro or combo. 12 would at least bring it to 1 in 5 cards, so you\u2019re usually seeing 2 by turn 3-4 depending on play/draw. 15 sounds better, making it 1 in 4 so that you\u2019re usually finding your second cycler in the opening hand or first draw step.\n\nNuijten was running *20* in his classic Witness list. Granted he had some interaction spells and wincons that just happened to have cycling\u2014but 1) you\u2019re already doing that more efficiently with Cast Out (why not try 2-3 since the 4-mana side is just a throw-in anyway?); and being in Legacy you also have access to much more aggressive dedicated cycling enablers like Street Wraith, which can \u201cgo off\u201d by drawing you several cards for 0 mana off a single Witness if you really need to dig for an answer. (If you do keep testing Rift, Wraith can also be Shock+draw for 1, with the inevitability of Buyback 0 when you eventually dig up your Witness and Drift.)\n\nGranted, more Witnesses does mean you can get away with slightly less cyclers, but until you can test a lot, I wouldn\u2019t count each Witness as more than 0.5 of a virtual cycling card to start out, given that...1) you need to have already drawn at least one cycler for Witness to count as the next; and 2) fairly often you will need to get something else back with your Witness off the Drift trigger, or use the Drift trigger to target something else entirely.\n\nI hope to hear more.
