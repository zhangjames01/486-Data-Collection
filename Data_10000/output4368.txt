The man nods once with a grunt, his stalk of wheat slowly being chewed down.\n\n\"And, ah, you're here for the, er, market... is that right?\" Asks the other. The man nods again, his wheat slowly grinding down between his teeth. The guards looked at the paper again, then to the man, then again at the paper. \n\n\"Well, it all seems in order to me... off you go.\" Says the first guard, and the man nods one last time, flicking the reins to move his mule. A few minutes later, he came to a stall in the market place, an old leathery lady running it.\n\n\"Markus, here with the wheat?\" She asked, receiving nought but a nod as he stepped off the cart.\n\n\"Profits are bad right now, I can only give you three royals for the lot...\" when said as she moved to help unload the sacks. Markus paused for a moment, then began to move thr sacks again. Coin in hand, he looked to her after the cart was empty.\n\n\"Bloodeyes moving in?\" He asked, and the stooped old lady looked away. She spat a brown phlegmy glob on the cobble and shrugged.\n\n\"Its either the Bloodeyes or the Craven...\" she answered after a moment. \"I can maybe spare another Royal if-\" she began, but Markus cut her off. He hopped up onto his cart again and whipped the mule, heading deeper into the town. Soon, he was in what the gentry would call the bad part of town, what he called a second home. He stopped in front of a run down building, glass broken out of the windows and shingles missing from the roof he could see. As he approached the door a man stepped out.\n\n\"That's far enough, whaddya want?\" The burly man asked, clearly a Thug.\n\n\"I'm here to see your boss.\" Markus stated, hands loose at his sides. The Thug snorted and came closer, shoving him back into his cart and ruffling through this pockets, before pulling out the papers. Stepping back he began to read.\n\n\"Surprised a Thug can read.\" Markus taunted, but the man ignored him. Finally he looked up and threw the papers to the ground.\n\n\"Wait a minute...\" he said, then went back inside. Exactly a minute later, the door opened again and Markus was roughly lead inside, past several other Thugs and even what appeared to be a Swordsman, judging by the fact the man had a gladius on his hip. He was shoved unceremoniously into a room occupied by three people, two men and a woman, who's sat behind a desk festooned with papers and coins.\n\n\"Markus Reach, Farmer... thirtieth level... well, what does a farmer want with us?\" Asked the woman behind the desk. The two men shifted their legs, and their hands strayed closer to the swords on their hips, rapiers.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not just a Farmer.\" Markus said in response as his own hands moved behind the small of his back, grasping the handles.\n\n\"Oh really, what kind of Farmer are you then?\" The woman asked, before a spontaneous blast of sound could be heard. Her head snapped back as blood and grey matter splattered across the wall behind her. Markus turned and shot the other two in the room, his guns sounding out angry reports.\n\nThe door was opened by the very same Thug from earlier, who received a slug through his eye for the troubles. As he heard footsteps come down the hallway, he yelled out.\n\n\"I'M A LEAD FARMER MOTHERFUCKER!\"", "edited": 1660889210.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man stood before the guards, his cart behind him, as they examined his papers.&lt;br/&gt;\n&amp;quot;A farmer, you say?&amp;quot; Asks one guard.

The man nods again, his wheat slowly grinding down between his teeth.

A few minutes later, he came to a stall in the market place, an old leathery lady running it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Markus, here with the wheat?&amp;quot; She asked, receiving nought but a nod as he stepped off the cart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Profits are bad right now, I can only give you three royals for the lot...&amp;quot; when said as she moved to help unload the sacks.

She spat a brown phlegmy glob on the cobble and shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Its either the Bloodeyes or the Craven...&amp;quot; she answered after a moment. &amp;quot;I can maybe spare another Royal if-&amp;quot; she began, but Markus cut her off.
