Converting office to residential will occur when it's economically viable. If we have an ongoing trend of 10 years of the offices in the financial district being vacant, maybe some buildings may do this conversion, but overall the trend is to come back to the office. This conversion has happened near St. Clair, Eglinton, I think it would be great for some old business parks that are just dead. The core, not so much since the trend prior to COVID was that we lack new office space. It could also be used for old office towers in Scarborough, North York, Etobicoke and the outer burbs like Sauga even.

Converting office to residential will occur when it&amp;#39;s economically viable. If we have an ongoing trend of 10 years of the offices in the financial district being vacant, maybe some buildings may do this conversion, but overall the trend is to come back to the office.

The City building inspectors already gave her an inspection and occupancy to live in it again I'm assuming. Direction to comply (to heritage items) is not an order under the Ontario Building Code Act.\n\nThe building inspector cannot make this an unoccupied building anymore just because of the heritage items. If she legally has the occupancy permit then the only thing they can do is choose to sue her, but would City of Markham do that? Also she just gets flack from her neighbors or whatever.\n\nThe City would have more teeth in enforcing if they were withholding the occupancy permit due to not building to the application drawings. If they granted her occupancy and then flagged the heritage after the fact, the city still has to play by the Ontario rules. Does the Markham By-laws list a fine for the actions, then I guess that's what it would be. She should maybe ask a lawyer specializing in construction/development for their opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nFrom the Ontario heritage Act, most of the power of the Municipality seems to be at the permit stage that has requirements when the permit is applied. Considering that the architect/builder will submit elevations with the design, including windows and the facade, fascia etc. why wasn't it flagged at the permit stage? Did they submit with false drawings and build a different home? Or was it missed at permit stage? What happens legally if the city granted the owner the permit for construction, and for occupancy, then comes back after for this \"direction to comply\". The building code doesn't cover reverting work for things like this because the focus is on life and safety items. But the heritage act has this rule:\n\n*\"Building standards by-law*\n\n*45.1 (1) If a by-law passed under section 15.1 of the Building Code Act, 1992 setting out standards for the maintenance of property in the municipality is in effect in a municipality, the council of the municipality may, by by-law,*\n\n*(a) prescribe minimum standards for the maintenance of the heritage attributes of property situated in a heritage conservation district designated under this Part; and*\n\n*(b) require property that is situated in a heritage conservation district designated under this Part and that does not comply with the standards to be repaired and maintained to conform with the standards.  2005, c. 6, s. 34.\"*\n\nDoes it count?

Also she just gets flack from her neighbors or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The City would have more teeth in enforcing if they were withholding the occupancy permit due to not building to the application drawings. If they granted her occupancy and then flagged the heritage after the fact, the city still has to play by the Ontario rules. Does the Markham By-laws list a fine for the actions, then I guess that&amp;#39;s what it would be.
