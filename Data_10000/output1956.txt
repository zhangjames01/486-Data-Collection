I'm not a doctor, and I'm not a lawyer, so don't take this as legal nor medical advice, but I quit drinking 5 years ago, starting with a stint in an outpatient program which had an emphasis on alcohol education. I don't usually post about that on this account, but I think you're missing something.  Let me try to put this from the doctor's likely perspective:\n\nFirst off, two assumptions are being made by the doctor, and I'm going to make similar ones here for the sake of narrative.  My apologies if they're incorrect, but here goes:  1) your drinking and subsequent withdrawal caused the BP spike, and 2) you're an alcoholic. I can't speak for #1, that's for a doctor to say.  #2 is going to be assumed from #1, and you admitting that you've been a heavy drinker for a while.  From there your heavy drinking *itself* coupled with your attitude was viewed as an actual threat to yourself here.\n\nYou were drinking heavily for a period of months, which can be enough to lead to physical dependence on alcohol. Alcohol is one of the rare substances where withdrawal can no-shit actually kill you.  It's a central nervous depressant, which means when you drink heavily, consistently, your body compensates over time to, y'know, keep you alive.  So what happens when you stop drinking?  Your body has to de-compensate, but that also takes time.  But y'know what? Until your body can compensate, which can take a week or two, you wind up with the shakes, the sweats, and things like crazy high blood pressure (on the low end), and delerium tremens and death (on the high end). \n\nSuddenly removing a heavy depressant (aka being sober when you're a heavy enough drinker) is akin to taking a ton of a stimulant, only you can't really control the dosing of that \"stimulant\" - it's a function of your body becoming more efficient at getting rid of alcohol, but having a ton of it for part of the time. Also it can take a few days to hit the peak of withdrawals, so you may not have been at the worst when you went in there, depending on timing. \n\nIf their assertion was that your drinking caused the blood pressure spike (and I don't hear anything where you refute that), and you were at risk of stroke (which can cause death) and needed to go to the ER, it follows that they believe your drinking was heavy enough to potentially kill you if you continued drinking.  Unfortunately, if it's potentially enough to kill you if you continued, that means it's also enough to kill you if you stopped cold turkey, and alcoholics aren't exactly known for their ability to taper off.  \n\nIf you were also flippant about the situation (\"I would have never gone to the ER unless my doctor had told me to\" sounds suspiciously like \"I don't think this is actually a problem\") you probably -were- a danger to yourself, because at that point, because you weren't understanding or accepting the danger that the withdrawal put you in. To safely stop drinking at that point, you'd need to taper down the depressants over time, and there are three ways to accomplish that.\n\n* Taper down your drinking slowly.  Like meticulously reducing your drinking by exactly half a drink per day. Good fucking luck, and more power to you if you can pull it off.  Hard, and given that alcohol fucks up your judgement, impossible for some people. I couldn't do it. \n* Out-patient + benzos or equivalent - daily check-ins with a doctor plus a week-ish long course of benzos to allow your body to slowly adjust back to the \"sober\" point.  You have to be trusted to follow the regimen, which implies A) that you take the problem seriously, and B) that they don't think you're at risk to simply abuse the benzos on top of the alcohol.  Because that's a favored pasttime of some repeat drunks as well. \n* In-patient - depending on the severity / how much medication you'd need, this is sometimes the only option. You came in already showing what they deemed severe withdrawal symptoms, so this is likely what you needed, from a medical perspective. You needed medical supervision.\n\nSo, from the doctor's view:\n\n* Your drinking was putting you at risk of stroke or death.\n* You didn't think it was a problem, and were 'only at the ER because your doctor said so'.\n* Alcoholics tend to lie, lie, lie. To themselves and to others, to minimize their problems. I had historically lied to my doctors about how much I drank (even when my liver tests came back bad), and minimized things, most of the people in rehab with me did as well. We were fairly open with one another though.  If you're admitting to X, you may well have been drinking far more.  Unfortunately you're going to be hard to trust at that point.\n* Alcoholics are addicts, and relatively unlikely to change spontaneously. Expecting an alcoholic to taper down drinking on their own would be reckless. \n* You didn't (and don't) seem to acknowledge that your drinking was an active risk to yourself that could warrant them involuntarily committing you. You were already at the point that needed medical supervision for your own safety because your BP was high enough to cause a stroke because of your drinking, and you may not have been at the peak of physical withdrawal symptoms. Unclear if you didn't volunteer to commit yourself, or if there was a reason they wouldn't have done that, but it seems objectively fair that you needed to be under medical supervision until physical withdrawal was complete. \n\ntl;dr - They had the legal power to commit you for being a risk to yourself, and they had reason to think you're a risk to yourself (severe alcohol withdrawal can cause death, and the fact that you're upset enough that they committed you a year later means you probably weren't taking it as seriously as it needed to be taken at the time, either).
