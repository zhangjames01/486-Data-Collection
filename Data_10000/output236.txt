I think our graduate statistics are a nice in-between for junior to mid-level dev salaries because we have a good mix of Japanese &amp;amp; foreigner students taking our course so it&amp;#39;s a good sampling of the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A big issue with pay scale reports that we see is that they&amp;#39;re either done all in Japanese, surveying 100% Japanese companies or they&amp;#39;re done by foreigners and don&amp;#39;t really survey Japanese-speakers. So you have to look at the two sides together to form a fuller picture. There&amp;#39;s also the issue where the foreigner community defaults to Western, which is also not the case. There are a lot of foreign engineers from Vietnam, India, etc. that don&amp;#39;t make quite as much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that&amp;#39;s helpful!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_hnq8m7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Tokyo/comments/hnq8m7/interview_with_code_chrysalis_cto_on_working_in/fxehpkh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Tokyo/comments/hnq8m7/interview_with_code_chrysalis_cto_on_working_in/", "name": "t1_fxehpkh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Tokyo", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1594281167.0, "created_utc": 1594281167.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://youtu.be/q3TSb_LwI6o"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r812", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Interview with Code Chrysalis CTO on working in Japan as a Software Developer", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Tokyo", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fxeh662", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "yanarchy", "num_comments": 43, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fxde24u", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_7uhox", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hi, I'm the person in the video.\n\nI definitely don't condone lying at all on anything and some of our graduates don't even know five kanjis.\n\nYou can definitely find jobs over $35k/year in Japan---our average salary is currently \u00a55.7MM for people coming out of our program.

This is a big investment and we want to make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. That means learning coding basics on your own and making the effort to learn enough to get in. I wrote about what we look for and how to get in [here](https://medium.com/code-chrysalis/how-to-get-into-code-chrysalis-all-about-our-admissions-process-3b4a52c4bfad). Our training begins from the application/interview stage, where we look for knowledge gaps---you'd be surprised how many supposedly seasoned developers fail their first interview with us. For those who don't do well in the admissions/technical interview, we give feedback/resources/homework and then reschedule them for another interview after a few weeks of study.\n* There have been different salary numbers getting thrown around. Our average salary is around 6.5 million; our median hovers between 6-6.2 million depending on the class. We currently have 100% job placement within 3 months in software engineering positions in Tokyo.\n* While yes, [our curriculum](https://codechrysalis.io/static/media/Immersive-Syllabus.pdf) is in JavaScript, we are here to graduate software engineers, which means that **language doesn't matter**. Case in point, [our most recent graduating class](https://www.codechrysalis.io/cc7) had [final projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UZ8xIfQKkA) built in C# &amp; Unity and Raspberry Pi &amp; React Native. We don't teach those. We also have a week where our students are required to build an app in a language of their choice that they have no experience in.\n* Not multiple, but a couple. We have two graduates at Google Japan. One is about to start on the Google Maps team as a software engineer, another is a customer engineer for GCP. We also have graduates working as software engineers at Paidy, Zehitomo, CurveGrid, Quoine, PlayStation, etc. Pretty good considering our classes have been small.\n* Yes, we provide job support. Everything from resumes/cover letters to technical/non-technical interviews to salary negotiation training.

Bootcamps can be a great way to get a structured education. Software is a broad, broad field and it's quite daunting to know what exactly to study or do if you're new. As long as you're a happy working dev, who cares how you obtained your education?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, co-founder of Code Chrysalis and the CTO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy to chat further but here are some things I wanted to address that I saw in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;#39;t take beginners and we don&amp;#39;t make it easy to get in. This is a big investment and we want to make sure you know what you&amp;#39;re getting yourself into. That means learning coding basics on your own and making the effort to learn enough to get in. I wrote about what we look for and how to get in &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/code-chrysalis/how-to-get-into-code-chrysalis-all-about-our-admissions-process-3b4a52c4bfad\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Our training begins from the application/interview stage, where we look for knowledge gaps---you&amp;#39;d be surprised how many supposedly seasoned developers fail their first interview with us. For those who don&amp;#39;t do well in the admissions/technical interview, we give feedback/resources/homework and then reschedule them for another interview after a few weeks of study.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There have been different salary numbers getting thrown around. Our average salary is around 6.5 million; our median hovers between 6-6.2 million depending on the class. We currently have 100% job placement within 3 months in software engineering positions in Tokyo.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While yes, &lt;a href=\"https://codechrysalis.io/static/media/Immersive-Syllabus.pdf\"&gt;our curriculum&lt;/a&gt; is in JavaScript, we are here to graduate software engineers, which means that &lt;strong&gt;language doesn&amp;#39;t matter&lt;/strong&gt;. Case in point, &lt;a href=\"https://www.codechrysalis.io/cc7\"&gt;our most recent graduating class&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UZ8xIfQKkA\"&gt;final projects&lt;/a&gt; built in C# &amp;amp; Unity and Raspberry Pi &amp;amp; React Native. We don&amp;#39;t teach those. We also have a week where our students are required to build an app in a language of their choice that they have no experience in.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not multiple, but a couple. We have two graduates at Google Japan. One is about to start on the Google Maps team as a software engineer, another is a customer engineer for GCP. We also have graduates working as software engineers at Paidy, Zehitomo, CurveGrid, Quoine, PlayStation, etc. Pretty good considering our classes have been small.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Yes, we provide job support.

We have a lot of former beginners take our course after studying on their own. Here&amp;#39;s our current cohort: &lt;a href=\"https://medium.com/code-chrysalis/code-chrysalis-cohort-7-student-introductions-4403d089ddab\"&gt;https://medium.com/code-chrysalis/code-chrysalis-cohort-7-student-introductions-4403d089ddab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;ve had older students in our program. Our average age is around late 20&amp;#39;s-early 30&amp;#39;s, so you would be on the older side, but not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How long will it take to study up to the admissions level? It really depends because everyone learns differently. I encourage you to use our admissions process as a roadmap for where you need to go. First goal: get past our coding challenge so you can submit.
