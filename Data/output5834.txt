It has been a ton of fun but I have had to make quite a few repairs.  I got pretty tired of this with the Rustler and a Typhon 3s which was equally delicate so I got a couple of race buggies (Serpent SRX8e Pro and Losi 8ight) which have been far more durable and capable under aggressive driving.  The brushed Rustler motor was prone to overheat so I had to add a heat sink and fan.  Eventually the motor bearing disintegrated, I replaced with an Arrma 3s brushless motor and esc from Jenny's. My opinion of the Traxxas gear is that there are some nice features, but at a questionable price premium.  I really like the clipless body system and the strapless battery hold down, but I can't say I would actually spend more money on them.  These features and the proprietary battery charging ID system make it a little simpler for kids to operate but I would still recommend supervision with LiPo batteries.  In my opinion it is easy to overdrive the Rustler which makes it rather prone to breaking; however, I have been impressed with its durability when driven slightly less aggressively.  I had to make a lot of repairs under brushed power so I expected to more or less destroy the car with the 3s setup even with cautious driving.  To my surprise, it didn't break at all when driven with the volume turned down.  I have slowly turned up the intensity and it is still intact.  I am driving it less aggressively than I was with the brushed motor, but the added power provides more flexibility and the longer battery life with the brushless motor is nice.

It has been a ton of fun but I have had to make quite a few repairs.  I got pretty tired of this with the Rustler and a Typhon 3s which was equally delicate so I got a couple of race buggies (Serpent SRX8e Pro and Losi 8ight) which have been far more durable and capable under aggressive driving.  The brushed Rustler motor was prone to overheat so I had to add a heat sink and fan.  Eventually the motor bearing disintegrated, I replaced with an Arrma 3s brushless motor and esc from Jenny&amp;#39;s. My opinion of the Traxxas gear is that there are some nice features, but at a questionable price premium.  I really like the clipless body system and the strapless battery hold down, but I can&amp;#39;t say I would actually spend more money on them.  These features and the proprietary battery charging ID system make it a little simpler for kids to operate but I would still recommend supervision with LiPo batteries.  In my opinion it is easy to overdrive the Rustler which makes it rather prone to breaking; however, I have been impressed with its durability when driven slightly less aggressively.  I had to make a lot of repairs under brushed power so I expected to more or less destroy the car with the 3s setup even with cautious driving.
