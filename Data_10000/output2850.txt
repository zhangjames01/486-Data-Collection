And I absolutely think it's a problem when people don't use gender neutral pronouns. What I was talking about more was when people use it as a derailing tactic. Mostly I don't see people bringing it up as it's own point, but when there is a discussion about rape culture (which contributes more to the acceptability of raping women and their silencing as victims; whereas men's forced silence is due more to different societal problems). Basically, it seems to be brought up in a way that isn't on topic.\n\nAs to the talk at University of Toronto, that sounds like it was a critique of feminism more so than supporting men's rights. And that's the issue I have with the MRM. It seems predicated on tearing down feminism, when it *should* be focusing on helping men by breaking down the parts of patriarchy that hurt them.\n\nAlso I'm all for critiquing feminism. It's often racist, classist, transphobic, homophobic, biphobic, and sometimes even misogynistic. But calling it out for not supporting men when your group isn't doing that either? That doesn't make sense to me.\n\n1) Women are now being pressured to take on the same high-stress careers in *addition* to the pressure to have a family (and that latter one is more of a problem for women than men). But yeah, the US really needs to take a cue from Europe and cut down work hours and stress in general. It's not helping *anyone*.\n2) This is a more recent trend. A few decades ago, girls were being told they weren't good enough at math and science (or even writing or art at higher levels) to do anything. When my aunt got a perfect score on a physics problem set in college, the prof said, \"Your boyfriend must have helped you.\" Even when I was in grade school, there were more men than women in the gifted program.\n3) This is just messed up. The draft needs to either include women or go away entirely. The scholarships are also a holdover from a time when women weren't going to college in the same numbers as men. Maybe it's time that changed.\n4) Then bring attention to it! I didn't know that! There should be groups addressing that issue and why they think it might be happening. Do men also *attempt* suicide at 4x the rate of women? Is this number so high because men dominate high-risk jobs and military service that increases their likelihood of PTSD?\n5) Again, why is this happening! Why isn't the MRM taking a look at these numbers? Is this because men are more encouraged than women to do more dangerous jobs? Or is it partially higher simply because men work more than women?\n6) This probably has a lot to do with veterans (who are mostly male). But again, delve more into this! Why is it happening? Maybe the MRM should be focusing on improving life for veterans!\n7) Yeah, this one is suuuuper messed up. Fucking patriarchy.\n8) I've never heard that almost half of men are the victims. Where do those numbers come from? Again, call attention to it!\n9) So what is the MRM doing about it?\n\nFeminism (as flawed as it often is) calls attention to issues that are being ignored and tries to change attitudes that cause those problems and tries to fix things! The MRM doesn't seem to do that. I looked at the A Voice for Men page, and every article talked about \"why feminism is wrong\" or \"how feminism hurts men.\" It's not feminism that's doing that, it's the patriarchy.

And I absolutely think it&amp;#39;s a problem when people don&amp;#39;t use gender neutral pronouns. What I was talking about more was when people use it as a derailing tactic. Mostly I don&amp;#39;t see people bringing it up as it&amp;#39;s own point, but when there is a discussion about rape culture (which contributes more to the acceptability of raping women and their silencing as victims; whereas men&amp;#39;s forced silence is due more to different societal problems). Basically, it seems to be brought up in a way that isn&amp;#39;t on topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to the talk at University of Toronto, that sounds like it was a critique of feminism more so than supporting men&amp;#39;s rights. And that&amp;#39;s the issue I have with the MRM. It seems predicated on tearing down feminism, when it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be focusing on helping men by breaking down the parts of patriarchy that hurt them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#39;m all for critiquing feminism. It&amp;#39;s often racist, classist, transphobic, homophobic, biphobic, and sometimes even misogynistic. But calling it out for not supporting men when your group isn&amp;#39;t doing that either? That doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Women are now being pressured to take on the same high-stress careers in &lt;em&gt;addition&lt;/em&gt; to the pressure to have a family (and that latter one is more of a problem for women than men). But yeah, the US really needs to take a cue from Europe and cut down work hours and stress in general. It&amp;#39;s not helping &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;.\n2) This is a more recent trend. A few decades ago, girls were being told they weren&amp;#39;t good enough at math and science (or even writing or art at higher levels) to do anything. When my aunt got a perfect score on a physics problem set in college, the prof said, &amp;quot;Your boyfriend must have helped you.&amp;quot; Even when I was in grade school, there were more men than women in the gifted program.\n3) This is just messed up. The draft needs to either include women or go away entirely. The scholarships are also a holdover from a time when women weren&amp;#39;t going to college in the same numbers as men. Maybe it&amp;#39;s time that changed.\n4) Then bring attention to it! I didn&amp;#39;t know that! There should be groups addressing that issue and why they think it might be happening. Do men also &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; suicide at 4x the rate of women? Is this number so high because men dominate high-risk jobs and military service that increases their likelihood of PTSD?\n5) Again, why is this happening! Why isn&amp;#39;t the MRM taking a look at these numbers? Is this because men are more encouraged than women to do more dangerous jobs? Or is it partially higher simply because men work more than women?\n6) This probably has a lot to do with veterans (who are mostly male). But again, delve more into this! Why is it happening? Maybe the MRM should be focusing on improving life for veterans!\n7) Yeah, this one is suuuuper messed up. Fucking patriarchy.\n8) I&amp;#39;ve never heard that almost half of men are the victims. Where do those numbers come from? Again, call attention to it!\n9) So what is the MRM doing about it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feminism (as flawed as it often is) calls attention to issues that are being ignored and tries to change attitudes that cause those problems and tries to fix things! The MRM doesn&amp;#39;t seem to do that. I looked at the A Voice for Men page, and every article talked about &amp;quot;why feminism is wrong&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;how feminism hurts men.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s not feminism that&amp;#39;s doing that, it&amp;#39;s the patriarchy. So do something about it! Talk about these issues and get some organizations to lobby for more veteran support or stricter workplace safety regulations.

I actually used to think men&amp;#39;s rights sounded like a perfectly reasonable idea, but I have changed my mind since I have never seen anything from the MRM that isn&amp;#39;t misogynistic or dismissive of feminism and women&amp;#39;s issues. If you have an example, I would love to see it!]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think one really telling thing about the MRM is that I don&amp;#39;t know of any men&amp;#39;s rights group that actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; anything to help men. If you know of any, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also feminism is HUGE and lots of people with very different ideas claim the title &amp;quot;feminist.&amp;quot; I think, though, that the biggest problems with feminist groups are when they ignore underprivileged groups (like trans women, women of color, disabled women, etc), and ignoring an overprivileged group like men is really &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fault with the feminist movement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit #2: I guess my main point is that I think MRM is almost entirely (Not)MRM, whereas only a very small part of Feminism is (Not)Feminism. MRM=(Not)MRM is a reaction to Feminism, though they claim to be a reaction to (Not)Feminism. So the MRM is mostly based on a straw man fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1t7s57", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/1t7s57/i_believe_that_at_least_on_reddit_the_feminist/ce5cu2t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1t7s57/i_believe_that_at_least_on_reddit_the_feminist/", "name": "t1_ce5cu2t", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1387433399.0, "created_utc": 1387433399.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1t7s57/i_believe_that_at_least_on_reddit_the_feminist/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Funny responses to catcalls", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "link_author": "ShiftyXX", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ce4iig3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tangoing", "num_comments": 179, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ce4ibg1", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_5mxw5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 1, "body": ":( I'm sorry.
