All extremely low threshold or sub-threshold dose. First, you would need to allergy test*^(PLEASE tell me you know what this means...) all of them, okay, NBD even being really safe and slow that shouldn't take more than a few days if you're just constantly doing 1mg or less allergy tests and giving each a half hour or so, especially if you've already tried any of them.\n\n&gt; Now, we want to be safe about this, right? We don't want an ADE, especially a fatal one. So, to do this experiment responsibly, we have to check -- at the very least -- each of the ~10000 pairs of drugs for the possibility either of synergistically increasing effects (and keep track of this over all) or causing an ADE. Now, if you had 100 pharms you could actually do this. It would take a long-ass time but all the information is there on drugs.com. But wait. You want to do this with RESEARCH CHEMICALS. Which means nobody has a fucking clue what ADEs they have or which combinations synergistically increase. We can *surmise* and try to make educated guesses based on known structural and functional relationships, but do you really think we'll be 10000/10000? Drugs are quirky man, Tramadol is the only opioid that is serotonergic and so even though you can ignore the whole rest of the group of opiates in terms of risk of serotonin syndrome, there's that ONE exception that is different. Because it'll only take one bad ADE that we didn't catch to maybe kill you or make you freak out or just give you a really uncomfortable experience. In general we don't expect dissociatives (NMDA receptor antagonists) to be serotonergic. But guess what? Both [dextromethorphan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextromethorphan)/its active metabolite [dextrorphan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrorphan) (just look at that pharmacology! Try and predict the effect of combining 100 drugs that act on that many different systems) and [methoxetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxetamine) are serotonin reuptake inhibitors -- I learned this the hard way when I took some 25C-NBOMe (a typical dose) while on (a typical dose) of MXE. If I hadn't had a handful of benzos on hand I definitely would have freaked out, probably would have had a seizure, and maybe a heart attack. It was WAY TOO intense. Just because I stupidly did not realize that MXE was an atypical dissociative in terms of its serotonergic activity. Drugs, especially ones with a short history of human use, aren't always predictable. Not to mention individual differences in brain and body chemistry. And that was just **two** drugs man. Come to think of it, one other time all I did was mess up my timing taking my daily sertraline dose (an SSRI), a mescaline cactus (serotonin agonist) dose I was planning on tripping on that day, and then 5-HTP to supplement since I had rolled the night before (stupid, definitely should have excluded it; it's a supplement which is a precursor to serotonin so you replenish it quickly). I took them all around the same time. This was at a festival again. Anyway, I hardly even started feeling the mescaline before serotonin syndrome hit me hard, and I got to miss the night away from all my friends feeling like shit in the med tent. It was nowhere near fatal but it was nowhere near fun. And it was just from my regular prescribed medication, a supplement (no active effects), and a single recreational drug, exacerbated or caused by taking them too closely together. This stuff is serious man.\n\n&gt; Look at all the possibility for human error. Even with perfect knowledge of these chemicals, which we don't have, this would be a very difficult experiment to perform at all safely. And for what? When you can gain so much from just...doing them the normal way? I just don't get it. Anyway, I hope you are at least smart enough to realize that I didn't spend hours of my time making these posts to fuck with you or put you down or lie to you. I am really hoping that I can get through to you and that you will finally see the logic of what (everybody else and) I am telling you. We don't know you, but we don't want you to die!

This stuff is serious man.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at all the possibility for human error. Even with perfect knowledge of these chemicals, which we don&amp;#39;t have, this would be a very difficult experiment to perform at all safely. And for what? When you can gain so much from just...doing them the normal way? I just don&amp;#39;t get it. Anyway, I hope you are at least smart enough to realize that I didn&amp;#39;t spend hours of my time making these posts to fuck with you or put you down or lie to you. I am really hoping that I can get through to you and that you will finally see the logic of what (everybody else and) I am telling you. We don&amp;#39;t know you, but we don&amp;#39;t want you to die! Go have some fun doing drugs the safe way!

There was a time in my life when somebody definitely needed to look me in the eye and tell me I needed to get professional help.

Then, since Wikipedia isn't a real source, I followed it up with \n\nB) A recent technical report (I also included a link to the authoring agency, HPUC, so you could verify its legitimacy) detailing actual statistics of adverse reactions (many serious, including death) happening *in a hospital* which by definition is a more controlled environment run by better-trained individuals than anything you can hope to set up. Which should hopefully make you realize that if they can make mistakes (not just a few -- a LOT -- and this is usually with just a few poorly chosen drugs! Definitely &lt;20 drugs being taken in almost all cases and usually just one specific combination of a few that should not have been co-administered lead to the ADE), you can MUCH MORE EASILY make the same mistakes, *especially when working almost exclusively with substances far less well-understood* than the thoroughly tested and FDA-approved and pharmaceutically sterilely produced medications used in a hospital setting. Do you see how on every level you are stacking extra risk? And they already mess up! Just think logically, or try, please.\n\nFinally, still trying to drive the point home I came up with and presented what I thought would be a very illuminating example. Lots of people take SSRIs. People sometimes supplement with 5-HTP. Then if they were to take just a *single* powerful recreational serotonergic such as MDMA or MDA or 6-APB, even at a reduced dose, this would almost invariably produce serotonin syndrome. I guess I could have explained more about [what that is and provided a resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome). Anyway, this is a really basic example where just 2 or 3 drugs when combined can lead to fatal outcomes.\n\nIt doesn't matter that \"you'll just take threshold of everything\" you're talking about ***100 DRUGS***. I don't know where you got the figure but even a quarter of that would be pretty much just as risky and guaranteed to wind you up in the ER or jail (depending on whether the physical or mental aspects end up being too much to handle respectively).\n\nI'm not out to make you feel bad. I'm trying to help you and teach you because somehow, sometime in the past, something happened or someone taught you something that was very very wrong. That's tough to come to terms with.

Those three possibilities I posted, again, were not exaggerated to scare you, they are the MOST LIKELY AND ONLY POSSIBLY outcomes of doing what you are proposing. Please trust that I know what I'm talking about.\n\n\nAnd maybe most importantly...do you even want to enjoy drug experiences? Or is this some weird game for you? Like I'm just so confused because every single drug is valuable and special in its own right (okay maybe some more than others, but they still have effects to be appreciated on their own). After you get familiar with things on their own (which is extremely rewarding! or can be anyway), yes some combinations can be very enjoyable -- being extremely cautious with what is being combined and in what dose! And we're still talking at most &lt;10 chemicals, ***IF AND ONLY IF*** the user has extensive experience with each and how each affects the user and knowledge of potentially dangerous interactions -- but it seems like you just want to skip past the whole part of the \"doing drugs\" thing we all seem to enjoy (where we take the time to enjoy the chemicals we obtain...) and jump straight to this weird idea that, naively, is just like getting to try all the drugs at once but, realistically, is just going to make your brain and body freak the fuck out. You will be lucky to survive with your life and freedom.\n\nAnyway, you'll probably ignore this so I don't even know why I try.
