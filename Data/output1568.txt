It isn't easy.  \n\nA teacher has to take information, break it into digestible chunks, and present it in a meaningful way.  That can take a lot of time, depending on the subject.  \n\nTry wandering into a sophomore English class and going through Shakespeare.  No one's going to understand it.  The students will quickly get bored and quit on it.  It's the teacher's job to prevent that by making it accessible.  \n\nAlright, so you're thinking you've got some good ideas and could definitely create some stellar presentations.  I'm sure a lot of people could.  \n\nThe next problem is that there's any number of people stopping you from doing that.  Students, parents, administrators, as well as local AND national government are constantly throwing a stick in the spokes.  \n\nStudents may not like the material at all.  They find it too difficult or irrelevant.  Constant disruptions in class will derail your plans.  \n\nSome students have special designations where they require additional planning required by law, essentially doubling your work.  There can be several of these students in one class, each requiring a different plan and different material.  This is non-negotiable, too.  \n\nParents might take issue with the material.  They'll call you, the administrator, or even the government to complain about whatever it is you're doing.  This may take you by surprise as you had no idea anyone could possibly be offended by this.  Sometimes they'll complain about something you're not even doing.  \n\nAdministrators *do not* want to hear from or about you any more than they have to.  If they even *think* you're going to cause them to work more, you'll get grief.  The students being over-the-top disciplinary issues?  That's on you.  You have to handle that.  The parents being a thorn in your side?  That's your responsibility, too.  It's expected that you keep in constant contact with them at all times, because you do *not* want the administration in there.  \n\nAnd to give due respect to the great administration out there, you still don't want to bother them.  Because when you bother them, it means the problems have escalated to such a degree that the entire school itself needs to be aware what's going on.  \n\nMaybe a kid came to class high.  Someone threatened to bring in a gun.  There was a fist fight in your class.  Even if the blame doesn't fall on you, you're going to be touching base with administrators and councilors and maybe even law enforcement.  This is time that you really don't have, because you need to handle the 10 different lesson plans you have to make for first period.  \n\nThen there's the government, which is always pushing some new agenda and some new gimmick.  They have no idea how it works.  They just came up with the idea.  YOU have to figure it out.  Is it No Child Left Behind?  Race to the Top?  It doesn't matter.  It's more standardized testing with some weird punishment for failure.  \n\nWorse, they can start shoving politics into your classroom.  In some places in the US, it's now an offense for kids to be gay, or to openly acknowledge homosexuality exists in the classroom.  Which means that when some poor kid is either outed or they decide to come out of their own accord, the law can now pressure you for not handling it.  So instead of letting this be no big deal that has absolutely no bearing on your class whatsoever, you have to either address the situation as the law requires or face punitive action.  \n\nAnd then there's you.  You could sit down and work for hours, days, or even weeks on a lesson that takes all of this into account.  You jump through every hoop.  Then you present it in class and find out it actually sucks.  None of the kids understand what you're trying to teach.  Everything falls apart right there and you're just lost.  If you're not good at improv, you're in *serious* trouble.  If one of the groups I mentioned above doesn't like you, they'll see this as an opportunity to attack you.  Even if you manage to save it, your ego is wounded and you'll think twice about exerting that much effort again.  \n\nAnd you get all this for barely any money.  And the money you do get goes back into the classroom because the schools aren't very well funded.  When talk of funding comes up, it's typically voted down because no one wants higher taxes. \n\nWhen talk of paying or respecting teachers comes up, people complain that we don't do anything.  We're glorified baby sitters.  We get two and a half months of vacation (unpaid, which in other professions would be considered a lay off.)\n\nAnd this just scratches the surface of the difficulties teachers face.  I couldn't begin to put down the horrors that await people taking this path in life.  \n\nAnother poster mentioned that it's a job in contrast to a passion.  It is a job, but if you aren't passionate, you're going to fail.  This is a job that requires self-sacrifice and suffering.  \n\nThere's good things, don't get me wrong.

They have no idea how it works.  They just came up with the idea.  YOU have to figure it out.  Is it No Child Left Behind?  Race to the Top?  It doesn&amp;#39;t matter.  It&amp;#39;s more standardized testing with some weird punishment for failure.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse, they can start shoving politics into your classroom.  In some places in the US, it&amp;#39;s now an offense for kids to be gay, or to openly acknowledge homosexuality exists in the classroom.  Which means that when some poor kid is either outed or they decide to come out of their own accord, the law can now pressure you for not handling it.  So instead of letting this be no big deal that has absolutely no bearing on your class whatsoever, you have to either address the situation as the law requires or face punitive action.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s you.  You could sit down and work for hours, days, or even weeks on a lesson that takes all of this into account.  You jump through every hoop.  Then you present it in class and find out it actually sucks.  None of the kids understand what you&amp;#39;re trying to teach.  Everything falls apart right there and you&amp;#39;re just lost.  If you&amp;#39;re not good at improv, you&amp;#39;re in &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; trouble.  If one of the groups I mentioned above doesn&amp;#39;t like you, they&amp;#39;ll see this as an opportunity to attack you.  Even if you manage to save it, your ego is wounded and you&amp;#39;ll think twice about exerting that much effort again.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you get all this for barely any money.  And the money you do get goes back into the classroom because the schools aren&amp;#39;t very well funded.  When talk of funding comes up, it&amp;#39;s typically voted down because no one wants higher taxes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When talk of paying or respecting teachers comes up, people complain that we don&amp;#39;t do anything.  We&amp;#39;re glorified baby sitters.  We get two and a half months of vacation (unpaid, which in other professions would be considered a lay off.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this just scratches the surface of the difficulties teachers face.  I couldn&amp;#39;t begin to put down the horrors that await people taking this path in life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another poster mentioned that it&amp;#39;s a job in contrast to a passion.  It is a job, but if you aren&amp;#39;t passionate, you&amp;#39;re going to fail.  This is a job that requires self-sacrifice and suffering.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s good things, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong.  But the amount of bullshit you&amp;#39;ll hear from people who&amp;#39;ve never set foot in classroom is absolutely infuriating.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11sea4a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/11sea4a/whats_something_that_people_often_misunderstand/jce2vv6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11sea4a/whats_something_that_people_often_misunderstand/", "name": "t1_jce2vv6", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678939213.0, "created_utc": 1678939213.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11sea4a/whats_something_that_people_often_misunderstand/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What is one thing in today's society that you believe will have a large negative impact on the future?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "Leo9991", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcdydmy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Frapplo", "num_comments": 197, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcb48kf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8jyqw", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "And that's a good first step.
