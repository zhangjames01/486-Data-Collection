And I bought the Vita because, quite frankly, I felt the Vita was for grown-ups and the 3DS was for children.\n\nWhich isn't to say you're a child if you choose as an adult to buy a device and play games made for children (like Pokemon, lets say). I mean I watch Steven Universe and Gravity Falls -- I'm not one to criticize anyone who enjoys media designed for children as an adult. But my personal gaming tastes are a bit more mature and you can't get games like Borderlands, XCOM and Valkyria Chronicles on the DS and you can on the Vita. It's just that simple.\n\nNow I wouldn't buy the Vita as a primary gaming device. The best way to go for that is still a gaming PC or barring that investment, the console of your choice. But as a handheld gaming device for someone who wants to be able to play [slightly dumbed down versions of] console/PC modern classics like BL2 or XCOM or Uncharted or Assassin's Creed or Need for Speed or Minecraft or Don't Starve or maybe you want to enter the wide, weird world of artistic-y JRPGs like Persona 4 Golden, then the Vita is your best bet. But if you're more into Mario and Pokemon, then get the DS.\n\nBut if you're worried about \"how long will my device be supported\", I wouldn't really worry about it. I mean the Sony PSP is 11 years old and Sony is just now starting to make owning one inconvenient, making you link yours to a PS3 or PC to buy and download games from the market. Given that timeline you've probably got at least 5-10 years of handheld ownership ahead of you before it gets \"weird\" to own one.\n\nWhich isn't to say that I love, love, love everything about the Vita. By far the library [of games that are actually worth owning] is much smaller on the Vita and if you don't care for JRPGs/Visual Novels/shovelware then the library is practically miniscule compared to its portable cousin the DS. And the proprietary storage media is way, way, way overpriced. I mean I was fortunate enough to get a 16gb card second hand from someone who didn't know what they were worth; but that's not something you should rely on -- the full retail price of those things is ridiculous. And then there's the fact that, unlike the DS, the Vita almost certainly won't be getting a bigger, better replacement that will be backwards compatible with my library like my Vita is with PSP games. There just won't ever be an upgrade, so I have to keep that in mind when buying games. They're just not going to be realistically playable in 5-10 years. (Yeah, yeah, emulators. I wouldn't rely on that tho.)\n\nSo if you want a portable unit to use as a secondary gaming device to play modern console favorites and JRPGs on the go with overpriced storage media and a known limited lifespan of 5-10 years, then by all means get the Vita. If you'd rather have Fire Emblem and Pokemon and 30 years worth of Mario and Zelda at your fingertips, get the DS.

And the proprietary storage media is way, way, way overpriced. I mean I was fortunate enough to get a 16gb card second hand from someone who didn&amp;#39;t know what they were worth; but that&amp;#39;s not something you should rely on -- the full retail price of those things is ridiculous. And then there&amp;#39;s the fact that, unlike the DS, the Vita almost certainly won&amp;#39;t be getting a bigger, better replacement that will be backwards compatible with my library like my Vita is with PSP games. There just won&amp;#39;t ever be an upgrade, so I have to keep that in mind when buying games. They&amp;#39;re just not going to be realistically playable in 5-10 years. (Yeah, yeah, emulators. I wouldn&amp;#39;t rely on that tho.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you want a portable unit to use as a secondary gaming device to play modern console favorites and JRPGs on the go with overpriced storage media and a known limited lifespan of 5-10 years, then by all means get the Vita. If you&amp;#39;d rather have Fire Emblem and Pokemon and 30 years worth of Mario and Zelda at your fingertips, get the DS. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null,

I run a sub on polling and while I don't really intend to talk about this poll in specific I will say this about polling in general:\n\nOne of the popular things to do or say when poll X comes out and candidate Y is not performing where you think they ought to be performing is to say the sample was off. There were too many of these people and not enough of those people and so forth. And while that's often true, that's true of every poll. There is no poll that will get the sample right. Period. So I don't generally find one poll getting the sample wrong too troubling especially when it's a pretty reliably okay to pretty good pollster like ABC/WaPo.\n\nBut the question remains, did ABC intentionally underpoll Republicans to get an intentionally skewed result? And the answer is: almost certainly not. And the reason I can say that confidently is because just about all pollsters have a vested interest in being accurate above all else. Because they aren't just polling for fun. These are for-profit companies running these polls and if it looks like they're intentionally skewing results, they'll lose business from politicians and corporations who hire them to get insight on public opinion. So it's highly unlikely they're trying to make one politician look bad intentionally.\n\nSo what is it? The answer is surprisingly simple: there are fewer Republicans intending to vote this November than Democrats or independents. It really is just that simple. Especially if there are several polls out that all show a similar trend: Republicans just aren't that interested this year in voting in the same number as Dems and Indies. Now as far as _why_ that is, I won't personally speculate, though enthusiasm for their candidate might be a bit depressed, possibly.\n\nIn addition it's worth noting that \"the polls are undersampling Republicans\" has been a common complaint in the last two presidential cycles even though the overall polling aggregate has really been quite good in 2008 and 2012. In fact the angst about the sampling was so high that \"unskewed polls\" became a big thing that \"unskewed\" the polls to make it look like Romney was leading Obama big time. In fact it's widely surmised that Team Romney trusted the unskewed polls over the poll-polls so highly he has literally no idea he was going to lose and did not bother to prepare a concession speech.\n\nSo yeah, if ABC/WaPo shows there's fewer Republicans in the sample, it might be just an unintentionally bad sample. Or maybe, just maybe, it's because fewer Republicans intend to vote for President this year.

Because they aren&amp;#39;t just polling for fun. These are for-profit companies running these polls and if it looks like they&amp;#39;re intentionally skewing results, they&amp;#39;ll lose business from politicians and corporations who hire them to get insight on public opinion. So it&amp;#39;s highly unlikely they&amp;#39;re trying to make one politician look bad intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is it? The answer is surprisingly simple: there are fewer Republicans intending to vote this November than Democrats or independents. It really is just that simple. Especially if there are several polls out that all show a similar trend: Republicans just aren&amp;#39;t that interested this year in voting in the same number as Dems and Indies. Now as far as &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; that is, I won&amp;#39;t personally speculate, though enthusiasm for their candidate might be a bit depressed, possibly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition it&amp;#39;s worth noting that &amp;quot;the polls are undersampling Republicans&amp;quot; has been a common complaint in the last two presidential cycles even though the overall polling aggregate has really been quite good in 2008 and 2012. In fact the angst about the sampling was so high that &amp;quot;unskewed polls&amp;quot; became a big thing that &amp;quot;unskewed&amp;quot; the polls to make it look like Romney was leading Obama big time. In fact it&amp;#39;s widely surmised that Team Romney trusted the unskewed polls over the poll-polls so highly he has literally no idea he was going to lose and did not bother to prepare a concession speech.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, if ABC/WaPo shows there&amp;#39;s fewer Republicans in the sample, it might be just an unintentionally bad sample. Or maybe, just maybe, it&amp;#39;s because fewer Republicans intend to vote for President this year. Looking at the polling aggregate and trends will give you a better idea of which of those is the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4pz8tq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4pz8tq/how_come_republicans_were_underrepresented_in_the/d4oxmyb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4pz8tq/how_come_republicans_were_underrepresented_in_the/", "name": "t1_d4oxmyb", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalDiscussion", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1466970449.0, "created_utc": 1466970449.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/4pz8tq/how_come_republicans_were_underrepresented_in_the/"}}], "before": null}}
