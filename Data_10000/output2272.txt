For example, I think &lt;strong&gt;Apex Theropod&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most thematic deckbuilding games around, because virtually all of the actions you take in the game evoke the idea that you are an apex predator: while the basic mechanism of spending cards to purchase cards is familiar from other deck-builders, in Apex you are either spending them to &amp;quot;hunt&amp;quot; prey, which give you a different currency to spend on cards that &amp;quot;evolve&amp;quot; your predator (your deck), making it more effective.  Brilliant immersion.  Conversely, a game like &lt;strong&gt;Kemet&lt;/strong&gt; has a very cool setting, but some parts aren&amp;#39;t really that thematic, like the ability to teleport between obelisks.  Mechanically, it&amp;#39;s very useful to drive the momentum of the game, but it has little to do with ancient military tactics.  Another example is the secret battle cards (I forgot what they&amp;#39;re called); from a mechanical standpoint, they could be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; thematic, simulating the idea that a particular squad or battalion has a hidden tactic to give them an edge in battle, but it ultimately &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; thematic at all because the cards are simply numbered to augment battle strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_lpmfqx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/lpmfqx/what_makes_a_game_thematic/godpcle/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/lpmfqx/what_makes_a_game_thematic/", "name": "t1_godpcle", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1614025923.0, "created_utc": 1614025923.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/lpmfqx/what_makes_a_game_thematic/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qmjp", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Recommend a low-rated game (not in the top 1000 on BGG) that you think deserves way more respect.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "boardgames", "link_author": "Coffeman94", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gmuk650", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "IvorySwings", "num_comments": 197, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gms47ad", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_a85ul", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Awesome, glad you were able to jump in on the expansion Kickstarter!
