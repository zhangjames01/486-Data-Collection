This is of course from the very limited information that I have here, but I am a special education teacher and the sounds very much like a person who has learning delays. This issue is more common than you think... It's not always a thing that people take into consideration when getting into a relationship, because when you fall in love with someone do you really care how *well* they can read a book? Whether or not they can understand a spreadsheet? How well they would do on a test?   \n\nBut the issues that come with having a cognitive delay present themselves in ways like this eventually. Lapses in logical thinking. Interpersonal relationships with social understanding. Finding a career that makes them happy, and understanding the importance of working toward a professional goal. College is not for everyone, and it is awesome that your wife has a loving husband to accept that. But there are other options for her to work and be happy. Are there career centers in your area? Therapy is always a good idea, and you can approach that is helping her solve some of the issues that seem to be occurring with her jobs, rather than a deficit on her part. \n\nAs for having this discussion with your wife, I do not think you ever should. I am someone that believes in being blunt about realistic expectations with parents or guardians of children, but to approach your wife and explain that you think she may have a learning problem which causes her to be unable to keep a job is going to create nothing but grief for you both. \n\nInstead, you should focus on the aspects of this potential learning disability that are affecting your life. Her ability to relate with people can be helped with therapy. Her lack of a job may be helped by a Career Center. You can help her create realistic goals and discuss what she would actually like to end up doing. You mention that she likes cleaning houses. Could you help her set up a website and see if she wants to give that career a try?

This is of course from the very limited information that I have here, but I am a special education teacher and the sounds very much like a person who has learning delays. This issue is more common than you think... It&amp;#39;s not always a thing that people take into consideration when getting into a relationship, because when you fall in love with someone do you really care how &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; they can read a book? Whether or not they can understand a spreadsheet? How well they would do on a test?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the issues that come with having a cognitive delay present themselves in ways like this eventually. Lapses in logical thinking. Interpersonal relationships with social understanding. Finding a career that makes them happy, and understanding the importance of working toward a professional goal. College is not for everyone, and it is awesome that your wife has a loving husband to accept that. But there are other options for her to work and be happy. Are there career centers in your area? Therapy is always a good idea, and you can approach that is helping her solve some of the issues that seem to be occurring with her jobs, rather than a deficit on her part. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for having this discussion with your wife, I do not think you ever should. I am someone that believes in being blunt about realistic expectations with parents or guardians of children, but to approach your wife and explain that you think she may have a learning problem which causes her to be unable to keep a job is going to create nothing but grief for you both. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, you should focus on the aspects of this potential learning disability that are affecting your life. Her ability to relate with people can be helped with therapy. Her lack of a job may be helped by a Career Center.
