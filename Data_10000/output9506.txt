Especially if your m.2 slot is gen 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For gen 4 slots there is the WD Black 770 series which CAN read/write at about twice the speed of this drive.  But, if it is for your OS drive it won&amp;#39;t make much difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then again, spend a bit more and the WD Black 850 series can run about 7000/6000 speeds on gen 4, but again you need to have a need for this, have a gen 4 slot and be willing to pay a bit extra.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Along with these general speed increases also comes random iop increases, which is where you see improvements in OS drives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to sum it up...  buy the fastest that you can afford and your board will use.  Don&amp;#39;t overpay for speed, don&amp;#39;t overpay for gen 4 if you only have a gen 3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_108gsq5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/GamingLaptops/comments/108gsq5/is_this_m2_ssd_good_for_gaming/j3ssdkf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLaptops/comments/108gsq5/is_this_m2_ssd_good_for_gaming/", "name": "t1_j3ssdkf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GamingLaptops", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673383733.0, "created_utc": 1673383733.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/hkyszr5guaba1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3mfgq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "When to upgrade 2700x to new chip?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "realAMD", "link_author": "Sir_Balmore", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j3smla6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Thunder_Bastard", "num_comments": 36, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j3s5hoz", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_5srxq", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Market can be odd with CPUs.
