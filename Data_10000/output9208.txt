The psychology program was much more work overall as it was 5 years of schooling (instead of 3), included 4 years of mandatory practicum and internships, and a dissertation. I never attempted the Bar but had to do a licensing exam for psychology (way way easier than the bar) but also a year of supervised clinical work. Law school was harder in a lot of needless ways because that\u2019s just how law school is taught. The PsyD was more work overall because that\u2019s the way most doctoral programs are. They\u2019re designed to be 5-7 years long with more afterwards for real life work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For what it\u2019s worth, I am called doctor because I work in a hospital. Other psychologists in hospitals are usually called doctor. It becomes less common the farther from clinical work you become.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_wd4x8z", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/LawSchool/comments/wd4x8z/why_dont_jds_call_themselves_doctors/iiioxt9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/wd4x8z/why_dont_jds_call_themselves_doctors/", "name": "t1_iiioxt9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawSchool", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1659368324.0, "created_utc": 1659368324.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/wd4x8z/why_dont_jds_call_themselves_doctors/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yrq6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Someone really doesn't like Sweet Caroline.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 10, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "PublicFreakout", "link_author": "goingsuspension", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "igabvfr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "wakawakathisway", "num_comments": 128, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ig9hfpm", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_6ntkl", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Can you elaborate?
