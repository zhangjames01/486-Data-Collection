Smaller batches will requires less at the same proportion.\n\n7) Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it glistens then slowly whisk in the flour until it makes a syrup-like gravy.  DON'T STOP WHISKING.  Keep whisking until the gravy is a chocolate/coffee color, but no further than that or you'll regret it.

The D/F# chord is just an &amp;quot;inversion&amp;quot; where the F# becomes the lowest note instead of D.  The root note of the chord is usually the lowest note, but in an inversion one of the other notes becomes the lowest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t mute the open-A string, it won&amp;#39;t always sound &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; per se, since it&amp;#39;s still part of the triad, but you&amp;#39;ll be playing both the F# and A notes at lower tones than the root note of the chord, sort of a total inversion of the chord (is there a name for that?). While it&amp;#39;s not wrong, it might not be the voicing of the chord you desire and sound a bit sloppy since it then becomes harder to pick up the D (that&amp;#39;s what she said). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the above comment says, if you fret the low string with your thumb and the rest of it like a normal open-neck D chord you can easily mute the A string with your thumb as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Playing the second fret on the high E-string like you would in a normal open-neck D-chord is perfectly fine as well if you want that higher F# note in the voicing of the chord. If you don&amp;#39;t then mute it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10xipxu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/guitarlessons/comments/10xipxu/how_do_i_cancel_out_those_2_strings_i_have_no/j7tey8a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarlessons/comments/10xipxu/how_do_i_cancel_out_those_2_strings_i_have_no/", "name": "t1_j7tey8a", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/guitarlessons", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675926747.0, "created_utc": 1675926747.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/3r3ee6fl74ha1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rwd9", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Is there a way to have a click track follow transients?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Logic_Studio", "link_author": "TerrificHips", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7magsc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jomofo", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10vumiz", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g8rn", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Another (laborious) way is to analyze the transients on the drum track and then use the beat mapping tool to map the grid to the transients.
