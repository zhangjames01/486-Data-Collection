I preface only to say we probably have different financials, but the problem is the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed the last couple years that I&amp;#39;ve gotten to where I want to be in the &amp;#39;corporate ladder&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;m happy at my job, I&amp;#39;m very good at what I do, and I&amp;#39;d like to continue doing it (and probably improving at it over time).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not allowed in this country(world?) anymore. If you aren&amp;#39;t actively trying to climb, progress your career, pushing for moremoremore, then you are punished. If you aren&amp;#39;t regularly job hopping or gunning for promotions, you wage is stagnating. It does not matter your field, your skills, or who you work for. If you sit at the same title/position, you are losing money every year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My company, like many, is one of those 2% raises a year companies. Basically, you never keep up if you are happy where you&amp;#39;re at. You&amp;#39;re not ALLOWED to stop progressing, lest you begin to immediately slide back financially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a capitalist world, there is no option for &amp;quot;Hey I like what I do and am happy with my amount of income/cost of living ratio, I don&amp;#39;t need more.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like, no fucking wonder mom and pop businesses don&amp;#39;t exist anymore. Because they were happy and didn&amp;#39;t feel the need for ALWAYS INCREASING PROFITS. They were content with their income and weren&amp;#39;t constantly greeding for more shit they don&amp;#39;t need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really dunno where I&amp;#39;m going with this, like I said just wanted to rant and vent, I&amp;#39;m just so tired of &amp;quot;needing to progress my career&amp;quot;....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11aq45o", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Futurology/comments/11aq45o/japan_readies_last_hope_measures_to_stop_falling/j9uno7t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11aq45o/japan_readies_last_hope_measures_to_stop_falling/", "name": "t1_j9uno7t", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677261909.0, "created_utc": 1677261909.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.ft.com/content/166ce9b9-de1f-4883-8081-8ec8e4b55dfb"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rgs7", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[Spoiler: 6.0] It's the New Cape Westwind", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 11, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ffxiv", "link_author": "EdgeWardog", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j9ucbi8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "PantWraith", "num_comments": 454, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j9u109w", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_6i89p", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;
