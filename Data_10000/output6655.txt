In order to get more, I&amp;#39;m going to have to find another doctor, or more likely a psych, which I&amp;#39;m doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say that doing all this stuff is easy and obvious, but once you actually start trying to do it, there&amp;#39;s so many roadblocks and it takes a long time. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to go to a psych since I was ten. And if I land a job, all those poverty benefits fly out the window, even if I still need them. You get punished for success. So we&amp;#39;re going through some complex shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s no excuse&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;there is help available&amp;quot; is fine and everything. But it&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re living in a utopia here. The internet cares about mental health issues but the government doesn&amp;#39;t give a rat. You have to really fight for this stuff.

That is the first most necessary thing, and we can break down in detail all other things.\n\nFirst point of discussion: You're gonna feel weird about it. It happens. When you think one way about a person for a long time, and then the core idea seems to fundamentally change, you can be thrown for a loop and feel dizzy. But remember, to your sister, she has always been the way she is, and nothing about her has actually changed beside how she is interacting with the world. It will take everyone time to adjust.\n\nBut you must try to adjust. Just like if your friend lost an arm, or you adopted a dog, or you move to a different house, change happens and even if it's awkward, you must adapt or risk hurting yourself and others. It gets easier over time, but only if you're making at least a little effort.\n\nThe person you thought was your brother was really your sister the whole time. She was pretending to be a boy in order to fit in. Now she isn't. You should be happy for her, because she is improving her life and self-esteem.\n\nRemember that transitioning is a choice, but transgenderism isn't. It's a biological fact that she is a girl with a boyish body. Trust me, if we had the choice, many of us would chose to be cis, but that simply isn't how nature works. People are complex, life is complex, and sometimes things happen we don't expect. But the science all points to gender being a natural, unchanging part of the self. If she denied this, she would be unhappy her whole life. She is not making the choice to be a girl. She is making the choice to stop pretending that she isn't one.\n\nIt's good that you say you will always love her. Just remember that her gender matters to her as much as yours does to you. You loving her does not change the fact that what she is going through is important. Love does not give you a pass to ignore it.\n\nI hear some people say to me \"I will always love you no matter what, I don't care what gender you are as long as you're a good person\", and then proceed to misgender me purposefully and make my life hard to try to change me.\n\nWhat you should take from this is that you *should* care what gender your sister is. Let her being a girl influence how you interact with her. She wants to be treated as a girl. So you should care that she is one.\n\nI know pronouns and names and such seem trivial, or uncomfortable, or perhaps they seem like a control or fantasy thing, but they are actually at the very core of what hurts or helps trans people. It is vital that you try to use female words for and with her, or at least correct yourself and accept corrections. Calling her a boy will hurt her as much as calling you a girl. Imagine being in her place. Imagine being misgendered constantly. Every \"she/he\" swap will hurt you or make you feel less of a person.\n\nSo be a good person and accept that she is who she is. If you still think its an opinion, or that you can somehow \"disagree\" with the idea of transgenderism, (I \"disagree\" with the existence of a lot of things, but that doesn't make them less real) then simply start researching the science behind it and you will see soon enough.\n\nIf you must do something, call her a girl. Call her a she. That's the least you can do. Even if it takes time, try to do it. It will make her very happy. And since you love her, you will see that she deserves to be happy.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "trans", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, in the end, if you love them, you must not sabotage them by purposefully misgendering them or things like that. That is the first most necessary thing, and we can break down in detail all other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First point of discussion: You&amp;#39;re gonna feel weird about it. It happens. When you think one way about a person for a long time, and then the core idea seems to fundamentally change, you can be thrown for a loop and feel dizzy. But remember, to your sister, she has always been the way she is, and nothing about her has actually changed beside how she is interacting with the world. It will take everyone time to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you must try to adjust. Just like if your friend lost an arm, or you adopted a dog, or you move to a different house, change happens and even if it&amp;#39;s awkward, you must adapt or risk hurting yourself and others. It gets easier over time, but only if you&amp;#39;re making at least a little effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The person you thought was your brother was really your sister the whole time. She was pretending to be a boy in order to fit in. Now she isn&amp;#39;t. You should be happy for her, because she is improving her life and self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that transitioning is a choice, but transgenderism isn&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s a biological fact that she is a girl with a boyish body. Trust me, if we had the choice, many of us would chose to be cis, but that simply isn&amp;#39;t how nature works. People are complex, life is complex, and sometimes things happen we don&amp;#39;t expect. But the science all points to gender being a natural, unchanging part of the self. If she denied this, she would be unhappy her whole life. She is not making the choice to be a girl. She is making the choice to stop pretending that she isn&amp;#39;t one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s good that you say you will always love her. Just remember that her gender matters to her as much as yours does to you. You loving her does not change the fact that what she is going through is important. Love does not give you a pass to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear some people say to me &amp;quot;I will always love you no matter what, I don&amp;#39;t care what gender you are as long as you&amp;#39;re a good person&amp;quot;, and then proceed to misgender me purposefully and make my life hard to try to change me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you should take from this is that you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; care what gender your sister is. Let her being a girl influence how you interact with her. She wants to be treated as a girl. So you should care that she is one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know pronouns and names and such seem trivial, or uncomfortable, or perhaps they seem like a control or fantasy thing, but they are actually at the very core of what hurts or helps trans people. It is vital that you try to use female words for and with her, or at least correct yourself and accept corrections. Calling her a boy will hurt her as much as calling you a girl. Imagine being in her place. Imagine being misgendered constantly. Every &amp;quot;she/he&amp;quot; swap will hurt you or make you feel less of a person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So be a good person and accept that she is who she is. If you still think its an opinion, or that you can somehow &amp;quot;disagree&amp;quot; with the idea of transgenderism, (I &amp;quot;disagree&amp;quot; with the existence of a lot of things, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make them less real) then simply start researching the science behind it and you will see soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you must do something, call her a girl. Call her a she. That&amp;#39;s the least you can do. Even if it takes time, try to do it. It will make her very happy.
