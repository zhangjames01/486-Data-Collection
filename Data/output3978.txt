Giving a show 2/10 because it&amp;#39;s not your style of humor is asinine; not everyone has the same type of humor, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make a show bad, and certainly doesn&amp;#39;t make it 2/10 bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Addressing your &amp;quot;I wish they had...&amp;quot; Thoughts, the show was always meant to be a spoof on the &amp;quot;unwitting hero&amp;quot; trope; the villains are boring because if you read old comics, the villains are remarkably boring and one-dimensional. They&amp;#39;re also made to be trivial to accentuate the triviality of Jen&amp;#39;s life; she&amp;#39;s a superhero but still has to deal with the bullshit any woman has to deal with daily. Titania was an incredible red herring, because her character has no reason to be more of a villain than she is (a rich, entitled influencer), and if she turned out to be some grand mastermind it would have subverted the show&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s intentions; that the &amp;quot;villains&amp;quot; aren&amp;#39;t actually that villainous, just entitled and arrogant assholes, usually with money, who have never been told &amp;quot;NO&amp;#39; in their entire life. They&amp;#39;re not meant to be feared, they&amp;#39;re meant to be pitiful (if that) because most of the &amp;quot;villains&amp;quot; in any slice-of-life sitcom are exactly that; mundane, pitiful, petty assholes. Intelligencia being just a random conglomeration of internet trolls is, unfortunately, very real and something we struggle to deal with currently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I respect your opinion, it&amp;#39;s still valid and I understand your views, I just disagree with your reasoning and the conclusion you come to&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null,
