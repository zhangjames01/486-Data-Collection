First, just like capitalism, socialism comes in many different forms. Some versions require an authoritarian regime, some do not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst let's define what socialism is because it's meaning has eroded so much, particularly in America. Socialism is when the mean of production are owned by the community.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo one example of socialism is a coop, where the workers own the company they work for. This is sometimes called \"market socialism\" as it functions within a market economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut even more, generally, I believe the main difference between communism and the more traditional version of socialism, is that communism requires a dictatorship whereas socialism is ruled by a form of democracy. For example, if in the united states, we nationalized car manufacturing, so that Ford and GM were operated and owned by the US government. That would be socialism as long as the government was populated by people that we elected in free and fair elections. One thing advocates of socialism will bring up is that it's a natural extension of democracy, and is more democratic than our current system.

The VA, the post office, or the oil industry in Norway. Norway is an interesting case, they own 2/3 of the shares of Equinor, and use those profits to fund various government programs. This is socialist, it's working fairly well, and is definitely not a dictatorship. Of course, Norway on the whole is Capitalist  (or more accurately a mixed economy.) But this shows how socialism can exist within capitalist frameworks, and how the divide isn't always as clear as we might think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain I'm not a socialist, but I think we need to have better conversations about systems of government and economics. Personally, I think of hardcore socialists and libertarians as two sides to the same coin. For every single problem we face as a society the hardcore socialist or libertarian will have the same answer, either we need the government to take control of that industry, or we need the government to be completely removed. Each problem is unique, and there is no one size fits all solution. Sometimes we need less regulation and less government involvement. Sometimes we need more regulation. Sometimes the private sector isn't a good fit for a given problem and the government needs to take control because their incentives more align with the outcome we desire. But this requires a detailed examination of each problem, which requires a lot of work, and it means you can no longer have an opinion on every single topic.

The VA, the post office, or the oil industry in Norway. Norway is an interesting case, they own 2/3 of the shares of Equinor, and use those profits to fund various government programs. This is socialist, it&amp;#39;s working fairly well, and is definitely not a dictatorship. Of course, Norway on the whole is Capitalist  (or more accurately a mixed economy.) But this shows how socialism can exist within capitalist frameworks, and how the divide isn&amp;#39;t always as clear as we might think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again I&amp;#39;m not a socialist, but I think we need to have better conversations about systems of government and economics. Personally, I think of hardcore socialists and libertarians as two sides to the same coin. For every single problem we face as a society the hardcore socialist or libertarian will have the same answer, either we need the government to take control of that industry, or we need the government to be completely removed. Each problem is unique, and there is no one size fits all solution. Sometimes we need less regulation and less government involvement. Sometimes we need more regulation. Sometimes the private sector isn&amp;#39;t a good fit for a given problem and the government needs to take control because their incentives more align with the outcome we desire. But this requires a detailed examination of each problem, which requires a lot of work, and it means you can no longer have an opinion on every single topic. In general, people would rather have a simple ideology that they can apply to literally every problem without having to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_111b2wa", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Libertarian/comments/111b2wa/socialist_friend_basically_shoots_his_ideology_in/j8dtoml/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/111b2wa/socialist_friend_basically_shoots_his_ideology_in/", "name": "t1_j8dtoml", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Libertarian", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1676304142.0, "created_utc": 1676304142.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/111b2wa/socialist_friend_basically_shoots_his_ideology_in/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s4tv", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What are people\u2019s thoughts about JRE\u2019s place on the most updated media bias chart?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "JoeRogan", "link_author": "PowerfulSquirrel4", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6t0e5k", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "unholyravenger", "num_comments": 1208, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10qwaze", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3wgcb", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Since no one is discussing methodology I will. \n\nFor each article/podcast they have 3 people who have consumed that media.

I remember pretty recently reading art was going to be one of the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; things AI would be able to do. Turns out we were pretty close to good text-&amp;gt;image. It&amp;#39;s going to be really hard to predict the path that AI takes. Problems we think are hard are going to be easy, and problems we think are easy will be hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10lnfy7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Futurology/comments/10lnfy7/are_most_of_our_predictions_wrong/j5zv1ne/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10lnfy7/are_most_of_our_predictions_wrong/", "name": "t1_j5zv1ne", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1674758837.0, "created_utc": 1674758837.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10lnfy7/are_most_of_our_predictions_wrong/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s5ti", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "meirl", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 7, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "meirl", "link_author": "Survivor_Oceanic815", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5ypp2g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "unholyravenger", "num_comments": 2230, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j5ya5hd", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_3wgcb", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It may be, definitely go get a sleep study done and find out.
