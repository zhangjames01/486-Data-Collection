There were definite days I did less than I should and resented my kids for needing me.  Yes, that is exactly as bad as it sounds, but it was my most honest struggle.\n2) different learning styles and abilities in multiple kids. This is difficult for the obvious reason of having to divide your time and attention differently.  But the other less obvious part is it plays into the self-doubt.  When one child can do something the other cannot, it is easy to start down the path of wondering what is normal. Then you start looking around and asking others, and you've entered the compare, panic, justify and be miserable loop.  My kids being just 16 months apart made this so exhausting for me early on, as I questioned everything I did.\n3) Curriculum. I have ideological opinions for education styles and the matching curricula that I found hard to implement with my kids.  We eventually got there, as they got older, but I had to \"compromise\" in the first few years. For example, I am a bit of a snob about literature, history and writing.  My son's auditory processing disorder made the first years in those subjects be a struggle.  He could not read aloud, write dictation or spell anywhere close to grade level.  I had to read to him more, \"dumb down\" his dictation and go over spelling words way too many times.   Meanwhile his little sister breezed through those things at a pace way beyond grade level.  I questioned if I should do different curriculum for each.  Eventually, about 4th and 5th grades, he found his stride.  He's a fabulous student now, but some of it is because I sort of created a curricula model myself (classical education is what we did and it works well in catering to individual abilities and styles but is incredibly intensive from a teacher prep and presentation standpoint.). Had I used a boxed curriculum, both of my kids would have been miserable.  If you have average kids, with average learning styles and strengths, you will be rare and lucky.  I know plenty of people who are successful with boxed curricula and modify for different needs, but it seems like that wouldn't fit what we were facing.  Picking curricula is important and expensive and overwhelming.\n4) Social stuff.  Yes, there are downfalls for social influence in brick and mortar schools.  Just because we choose to avoid those doesn't mean we can't be honest that homeschooling has some social struggles as well.  My kids did not mesh AT ALL with the kids in our homeschooling groups.  We tried many, and it was a pain.  They went to a private school for a year while I was sick, and they found friends there- and they were the kids whose parents I didn't really care for. When you homeschool, you as a parent have to spend time with other parents, as much if not even more than your kids.  Chances are, you will find parents whose kids you like.  But you might not.  My kids are also way more social than I am, and they wanted more interactions than I wanted.  Not really liking the parents of the kids they liked was draining on me.  To be honest, I'm still not a big fan of most of the homeschooling families we run into.  My kids now find most of their friends through their sports and the neighborhood, and we have very few other close homeschooling friends.

I encourage you to try to keep being polite and consistent.  Perhaps go out of your way for them to see you rejecting other peoples&amp;#39; food, not just theirs.  Make a big production of reading your packaged food in front of them &amp;quot;I have to make sure they haven&amp;#39;t changed processing facilities or ingredients since the last time I bought this&amp;quot; and maybe even mention your allergy when ordering food at restaurants.  Even things you have already done, do again in front of them so they see that your diligence isn&amp;#39;t personally directed at them.  Just check off your list the things to try and hope they come around.  But, at the end of the day, I would just learn to let it roll off your back.  It may never fully go away, but you really can choose to not let it bother you.  They can choose the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_47e6do", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/47e6do/me_25_f_with_my_boyfriend_26_m_of_one_year_his/d0dfyg7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/47e6do/me_25_f_with_my_boyfriend_26_m_of_one_year_his/", "name": "t1_d0dfyg7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1456420766.0, "created_utc": 1456420766.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/47e6do/me_25_f_with_my_boyfriend_26_m_of_one_year_his/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_377ps", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What's the single dimmest thing your MIL has ever said?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 45, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "JUSTNOMIL", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d0cb7s1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "SuperDuperLily", "num_comments": 513, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_47cym5", "score": 45, "author_fullname": "t2_70bp0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The only reason we are required to use baby car seats these days is because of the Damn Democrats.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only reason we are required to use baby car seats these days is because of the Damn Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_47cym5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/47cym5/whats_the_single_dimmest_thing_your_mil_has_ever/d0cb7s1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/47cym5/whats_the_single_dimmest_thing_your_mil_has_ever/", "name": "t1_d0cb7s1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/JUSTNOMIL", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1456342877.0, "created_utc": 1456342877.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/47cym5/whats_the_single_dimmest_thing_your_mil_has_ever/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Me [28 M] with my girlfriend [24 F] of 5 years, have different sleep patterns - says im selfish", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "relationships", "link_author": "sleep_patterns1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "czu9yek", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "SuperDuperLily", "num_comments": 47, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cztytge", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_70bp0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have her research the blue light/screen affects on sleep.

We are now, ironically, super thrilled with our public school.  We found a brand new charter, classical school that opened in our neighborhood this fall, and we jumped at the chance to join it.  (If you homeschool, I highly encourage you to look into using the classical method, it is my favorite for kids with language struggles.  I'd be happy to share with you why, if you'd like.

There are many ways that schools can approach language education, and kids will all respond a little differently to each.  My daughter is the kind of student who can and does learn language and math easily, anywhere.  The classical method is great about keeping her engaged in science and history.

I do believe the people behind public schooling have decent intentions, to try to make education pluralistic and accessible to all.
