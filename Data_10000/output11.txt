A romantic partner should find this sort of trait in you to be very admirable.  If you can grow to contain yourself, especially when you are angry or frustrated, then you will be greatly prepared to deal with life's challenges.  Children can be the most annoying or the most adorable creatures around; you have the mental power to decide that for yourself before ever having any kids of your own.\n\n&gt;I really don't know why people don't like me\n\nYou are not alone in this way.  I lived under the assumption that I was a constant nuisance to everyone around me, so I sought to minimize my social foot-print, so to speak.  I still felt like everyone wanted me gone, so my minimalism didn't help me at all.  This was not a conscious belief, but a deeply embedded mental framework, built up during my childhood.\n\nMy question for you: can you recall a specific time when someone went out of their way to demonstrate dislike towards you, something you did, or something you said?  Don't analyse those instances; just count them.  Through all of high school and college, I can count the times I was explicitly disliked on one hand; I nevertheless felt unwelcome everywhere there were people.  I was utterly disconnected from reality.\n\n&gt;im kind of a loner and prefer it this way, but at least a bit more human interaction wouldn't hurt.\n\nIf you feel drained after extended social interaction, especially in a group setting, then you could be an introvert.  This is a relatively common personality trait, but it gets treated like an oddity by unknowing extroverts.  Further, many introverts learn how to manage their time alone vs time with others in order to maximise their creativity.  Neal Peart is a good example thereof.\n\n&gt;two of the \"popular\" girls came to me and said they find it's a shame that I come to school so rarely because they think I'm a cool guy.\n\nHow often have you heard these girls call other guys cool?  Further, how often do you hear any girl call any guy cool?\n\n&gt;Yet, we really rarely talk with each other at school.\n\nCan you remember the last time you started a conversation with someone?  You possibly have two girls that would talk to you if only you started talking to them.  Perhaps there are more who just aren't as brave as those two.  You won't know until you start the conversations.\n\n&gt;I mean, if they thought I was a \"cool guy\", why would they ignore me all the time at school? Well, they didn't really ignore me, *but they don't make an effort to talk to me either.*\n\nBased on the two girls's remarks, I think they are assuredly *not* ignoring you.  Girls are often more shy than guys; its partly genetic and partly societal.  Good news is that you have essentially been told that they would like to talk to you more.  If you are interested in a specific girl (not necessarily one of those two), then start a conversation with her to learn more about her.  Ask yourself what you would like to learn about her and use that to guide the conversation.  As long as you are reasonable and calm, you will probably do fine.\n\nLast thing for now: be as open as you can with your therapist.
