Shifts were in the middle of the day, and max shift length was 6 hours, avg being 4-5 hours.  \n\nI remember at 23 i was making $15k a year working 6-7 days a week (because insanely i could work 7 days a week and not hit 40 hours still).  Literally could not afford anything except bills associated with my car.  All my friends were starting to get careers and traveling and enjoying life.  Even my older brother (who strangely my parents completely supported his young adulthood)\n\nAnd it's like the revelation i had later that basically my dad was using that job to as you said, \"maintain social dominance\" over me was just fucking difficult to deal with.\n\nI remember bringing up the issue approaching my 10 year mark with my parents after my girlfriend had dumped me for being unable to get past their emotionally manipulative behavior to keep me from quitting. Literally one thing my dad would do would just refuse to talk to me for a full week if he even got wind i was thinking of quitting.  Makes it really hard to quit if you can't physically talk to your boss to quit, lol.\n\nBut like i remember talking to them on how i'm literally a loser in life, the type of people they would make fun of, but ironically the \"losers\" they make fun of actually made more money than i did.\n\nRemember going to them and being like \"I've been in the same job, in the same *position* in that job for near 10 years now, I make a dollar above minimum wage, every high schooler you hire and quits a year later makes more than me.  I still live at home, i can't afford to move out, i can't even afford to feed myself really 3 meals a day if i were to move out.  i'm not even building a savings because i make so little.  My girlfriend also dumped me because i'm not able to support myself and she doesn't want to take care of me if i can't even make a proper full time minimum wage salary.  You guys wont let me get a second job really because you require me to be on call for every shift, so any business i tell 'yea i can't work 9-6M-F, 9-5sat, and 12-4 sundays' just laughs me out the door\"\n\nAnd the gaslighting in their response was fucking insane.\n\nMy dad actually telling me i didn't need to worry about building a savings because i shouldn't want to retire anyway, that retiring would be \"boring\" ^(trust him), and that i'm fine and not a loser and just need to understand that im *supporting the family*.\n\nand my mom telling me to don't worry i was a real catch and any girl would be lucky to have me, and that there's no reason a girl my age should see my work and financial position as a red flag.\n\nAnd then both just really lay in to me on how i needed to understand i was supporting the family and insinuating they'd be in financial trouble if i left.  Which i would believe because my dad would often empty my savings account to pay the rent for his business, telling me if i didn't let him borrow it that we could lose the store and then lose the house.\n\n\nProbably the grossest thing though is, some major companys started up their own private brands of our 3rd party type franchise store, and i probably easily could have gone to any one of them and been hired at $20/hr on the spot to manage one, which i almost did after getting in to a fight with my dad, but he made sure to tell me that i signed a \"non-compete\" agreement when i started at his store, which meant i legally couldn't.  Thing is, we live in California, California has banned noncompete clauses for over a century.  So he lied to me, so he could tell me i would get fired right away the moment they found out so he could keep me poor and working for him instead.\n\nStill makes my blood boil to this day thinking back on it.", "edited": 1674381390.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man this brought back bad memories of working for my boomer father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He paid me minimum wage for &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; years.  basically the only time i got a raise was when the government raised the minimum wage, outside a couple of raises of literally a 25 cents&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He forced me to work for him at 14, and then once i turned 18 became grossly emotionally manipulative to keep me from quitting and basically used that job to control my life.

Makes it really hard to quit if you can&amp;#39;t physically talk to your boss to quit, lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But like i remember talking to them on how i&amp;#39;m literally a loser in life, the type of people they would make fun of, but ironically the &amp;quot;losers&amp;quot; they make fun of actually made more money than i did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember going to them and being like &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been in the same job, in the same &lt;em&gt;position&lt;/em&gt; in that job for near 10 years now, I make a dollar above minimum wage, every high schooler you hire and quits a year later makes more than me.  I still live at home, i can&amp;#39;t afford to move out, i can&amp;#39;t even afford to feed myself really 3 meals a day if i were to move out.  i&amp;#39;m not even building a savings because i make so little.  My girlfriend also dumped me because i&amp;#39;m not able to support myself and she doesn&amp;#39;t want to take care of me if i can&amp;#39;t even make a proper full time minimum wage salary.  You guys wont let me get a second job really because you require me to be on call for every shift, so any business i tell &amp;#39;yea i can&amp;#39;t work 9-6M-F, 9-5sat, and 12-4 sundays&amp;#39; just laughs me out the door&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the gaslighting in their response was fucking insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My dad actually telling me i didn&amp;#39;t need to worry about building a savings because i shouldn&amp;#39;t want to retire anyway, that retiring would be &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; &lt;sup&gt;trust him&lt;/sup&gt;, and that i&amp;#39;m fine and not a loser and just need to understand that im &lt;em&gt;supporting the family&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and my mom telling me to don&amp;#39;t worry i was a real catch and any girl would be lucky to have me, and that there&amp;#39;s no reason a girl my age should see my work and financial position as a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then both just really lay in to me on how i needed to understand i was supporting the family and insinuating they&amp;#39;d be in financial trouble if i left.  Which i would believe because my dad would often empty my savings account to pay the rent for his business, telling me if i didn&amp;#39;t let him borrow it that we could lose the store and then lose the house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Probably the grossest thing though is, some major companys started up their own private brands of our 3rd party type franchise store, and i probably easily could have gone to any one of them and been hired at $20/hr on the spot to manage one, which i almost did after getting in to a fight with my dad, but he made sure to tell me that i signed a &amp;quot;non-compete&amp;quot; agreement when i started at his store, which meant i legally couldn&amp;#39;t.  Thing is, we live in California, California has banned noncompete clauses for over a century.  So he lied to me, so he could tell me i would get fired right away the moment they found out so he could keep me poor and working for him instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still makes my blood boil to this day thinking back on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10i9hv1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WorkersStrikeBack/comments/10i9hv1/a_daughter_tries_to_explain_why_her_mom_isnt_able/j5e5rcz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersStrikeBack/comments/10i9hv1/a_daughter_tries_to_explain_why_her_mom_isnt_able/", "name": "t1_j5e5rcz", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WorkersStrikeBack", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1674380792.0, "created_utc": 1674380792.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://v.redd.it/c0554hdqujda1"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Justice Department conducts search of Biden\u2019s Wilmington home and finds more classified materials", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 11, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "link_author": "Beckles28nz", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5e1pty", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "FoxRaptix", "num_comments": 1491, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10i5m4x", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_az1gd", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Remember, Biden was searched because he was voluntarily cooperating with investigators to make sure they could return all classified material that might still be at his residence.\n\n\nTrump was searched because the government had enough evidence he was still *intentionally* hiding classified material from the government after he was ordered to return it and they had to issue a search warrant to do it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, Biden was searched because he was voluntarily cooperating with investigators to make sure they could return all classified material that might still be at his residence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trump was searched because the government had enough evidence he was still &lt;em&gt;intentionally&lt;/em&gt;
