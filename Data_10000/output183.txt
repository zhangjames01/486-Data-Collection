We found it to be a good starting place.  \n\nAs to selecting an inspector, the first rule is to NEVER go with the inspector suggested by the realtor.  There is a major conflict of interest present with that relationship.  \n\nWe looked for an inspector who would provide a thorough inspection with clear dialogue in his findings.  Our inspector took pictures of everything, walked us through every issue, answered all of our questions, and even told us how much to expect in repair costs.  The whole inspection of our 2 flat took close to three hours with the vast majority of the time being spent in the basement (inspecting structure, boiler, foundation, piping, etc) and outside (looking at the roof, siding, garage).  He was limited by that he couldn't break into any walls, but we took a few small liberties ourselves since the place was a dump to begin with.  He sent us a 32 page report with pictures that had the issues circled and flagged.  He missed that the siding was asbestos until the top layer, but he couldn't see it, couldn't pry up the aluminum siding (so we didn't hold that against him).  We'll know that for the next place that we buy.\n\nMy advice is to learn everything you can about the most expensive issues you may find and how to identify them.  You will want to concentrate on structure, roof, plumbing, electrical, and HVAC.  Those are your big ticket items.  Anything with asbestos (siding, tiling, pipe insulation) is a huge problem, so learn what that typically looks like and what era of houses are most at risk for having it.  Same thing with lead paint and piping.  Don't worry overmuch about pests (roaches, rats, etc) unless they are affecting the roof or structure of the house.  A good exterminator can take care of most pest issues within a few months.  Plus, most people are scared off by pests, so those houses can be hidden gems.  The last piece is to know and understand what to do about unwanted tenants or squatters if you are trying to buy an occupied building.  We found that cash for keys was the most effective method of getting people out. \n\nGood luck with your house hunting!  If you are curious where I am getting this information from, my husband and I are [blogging](http://twoflatremade.com/) our house renovation which includes a lot of technical details in the posts.

He missed that the siding was asbestos until the top layer, but he couldn&amp;#39;t see it, couldn&amp;#39;t pry up the aluminum siding (so we didn&amp;#39;t hold that against him).  We&amp;#39;ll know that for the next place that we buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My advice is to learn everything you can about the most expensive issues you may find and how to identify them.  You will want to concentrate on structure, roof, plumbing, electrical, and HVAC.  Those are your big ticket items.  Anything with asbestos (siding, tiling, pipe insulation) is a huge problem, so learn what that typically looks like and what era of houses are most at risk for having it.  Same thing with lead paint and piping.  Don&amp;#39;t worry overmuch about pests (roaches, rats, etc) unless they are affecting the roof or structure of the house.  A good exterminator can take care of most pest issues within a few months.  Plus, most people are scared off by pests, so those houses can be hidden gems.  The last piece is to know and understand what to do about unwanted tenants or squatters if you are trying to buy an occupied building.  We found that cash for keys was the most effective method of getting people out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck with your house hunting!
