There are basically a few levels of quality for the different methods of getting a picture from your pc to your VR Headset. From Best to worse is\n\nDisplayPort or HDMI to the headset. This is a wired connection. (Think the Index where you get an uncompressed signal from the PC to the headset through a cable) Not applicable here because the quest pro doesn\u2019t use an HDMI or DisplayPort cable.\n\nNext would be a USB-C as Display port Alt mode. Wired connection with USB-C requires the headset to support the alternate display port mode over USB c. It is basically just like above, except a compatible graphics card and headset that supports display port-alt mode. (Not applicable here)\n\nNext is going to be the Oculus Link cable that uses video compression to send the video over the USB C cable from any USB c port on the computer (not a usb C port from the graphics card) as a USB 3.1 connection. The video is encoded and sent over the USB 3.1 connection at a high bit rate. This connection is the first wired connection with compression and bitrate adjustments to the signal image, but in the case of the Oculus quest and quest pro headsets, this is the only thing it supports via a wired connection.\n\nFinally is to use Virtual Desktop or Oculus Airlink to stream the video signals and controls wirelessly over your home network, or through an optional D-Link VR Air Bridge for $99 plugged directly into your pc (search D-Link Air Bridge)   \u2026   Basically this compresses the video signal and lowers the bitrate a little more, but offers the ability to play wirelessly. The better wireless networking you have, for example Wi-Fi 6 on the 5ghz band, the higher the bandwidth you can use to crank up the quality settings. Not only are you dealing with a bandwidth issue, you\u2019re also adding a bit of latency.\n\nSo to summarize, $80 for a special Oculus USB-C cord that makes you wired to  your PC with a no fuss connection for PC VR. You can also search Amazon or Reddit for other USB-C compatible cables that are MUCH cheaper than $80. (This oculus one is an optical cable\u2026but still expensive) Or you can you Air link with your current network equipment to stream from your PC to your headset to play PCVR games. Or you can use Virtual Desktop on your networking equipment (The original streaming app by developer Guy Godin. It costs money, but the app is supported very well by a developer that truly cares. This was created before Oculus developed their own streaming application). Finally you can buy the optional $99 D-Link Air Bridge so that you don\u2019t have to worry about your router, the Air Bridge will just connect your headset to your PC.\n\nThere may be some details that are incorrect, but I wanted to get as much information to you as quickly as possible. I\u2019m sure other people will be able to correct my errors in how DisplayPort alt mode works, but that\u2019s my understanding (and it really isn\u2019t applicable to the Quest Pro anyway\u2026just for reference)\n\nBest of luck!", "edited": 1669927157.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link cable is a USB C cable that connects from your pc to the headset.

Removing cost from the equation, I personally feel that the Meta Quest Pro is better for me. The clarity of the image between the Index and the MQP is night and day difference. The Quest Pro is clear throughout the entire field of view. No more \u201cBatman\u201d or owl turning of your head to look at something in focus; you can just move your eyes. The sweet spot on the MQP is so much larger than the Index as well.\n\nThe field of view is very subjective but I would say that they are similar. Index may have a smidge more fov\u2026but honestly it\u2019s like a Phillips hue light behind the tv where the expanded fov of the index might as well be colored light as that is what you\u2019ll see at the edge: a smeary, pixely, godray -filled, peripheral expansion. [I\u2019m being a little harsh here. The Index isn\u2019t bad, but when you compare it to the Quest Pro, there is a difference that you won\u2019t forget.]\n\nIn regards to the frame rate\u2026for me\u2026I have solid 20/20 vision, I appreciate graphics, but I live for buttery smooth frame rates. Index will get you 144 frames per second, assuming you have the machine that can push those frames. With the Meta Quest Pro, the maximum you will get is 90. John Carmack said that it is a hardware limitation of the panel on the MQP. Unfortunately, I hadn\u2019t used the Index in many months since using the MQP\u2026and I\u2019m happy that I can\u2019t really tell you the difference between the 120 or 144 frames versus the 90hz. 90 hertz works for me on the Quest Pro, although I feel like I would always be happier with a few more frames even with the degradation of graphic settings if necessary.\n\nTracking\u2026The knuckles controllers are awesome. Strap them on and you can squeeze, use finger tracking, naturally grasp and let go. The knuckles are my favorite lighthouse based controllers. The Touch Pro controllers on the other hand are both better and almost as good in different ways\u2026\n\nSo the knuckles controllers can be occluded if you are putting your hand under a desk where your base station doesn\u2019t shine. Another example is if you are rotated in your play space where you have two base stations and one is behind you, one is in front of you, you have your hands in a boxing \u201cfists up\u201d location with left in front and right behind\u2026.it is possibly, albeit unlikely, that the right hand could become occluded and lose tracking.\n\nWith the Touch Pro Controllers on the Meta Quest Pro. I haven\u2019t been able to lose tracking under normal circumstances. (I have been able to have a little bit of drift when in complete darkness using an IR flood light. I need more IR light) When I boot up the headset and controllers, the controllers can take about three seconds to show up\u2026(be in a general area but not quite lining up with where they are) and then about four more seconds to snap to exactly where they are in the world. After that I\u2019ve had no issues with my hands under my desk, in front or behind one another, quickly moving or rotating the controls, etc. Unfortunately, there is no knuckles like strap, and that is the downside. No capacitance finger tracking and a grip button instead. The controllers are much smaller than the knuckles and once you had a 3rd party strap, they could be more comfortable than knuckles controllers for some hand types. Again, that would be down to personal preference as I find that they are both great controllers.\n\nSpeakers on the headsets\u2026.there is no contest here. Index still has the best audio system on a VR headset in my opinion. Quest Pro isn\u2019t bad\u2026but it is in the minor leagues compared to the Index. MQP is fine, it is passable, you\u2019ll enjoy it, but the Index is 100% better in audio quality.\n\nWith the \u201cquick\u201d answers out of the way here is my story so you can possibly see from my point of view a little:\n\nI bought the Index when it came out. It was a huge upgrade from the HTC Vive for me and the knuckles controllers we leagues better than the wands. The Index is one of the most comfortable headsets stock, and lighthouse tracking was the absolute best tracking then and still is as amazing now.\n\nBefore I bought the Index, I purchased the TP Cast wireless adapter for the HTC Vive and wireless VR was so freeing. I ultimately returned the TP CAST and went back to wired VR, because spending about $500 for a wireless adapter didn\u2019t make sense to me at that time. Also,a cord isn\u2019t really a big deal and yes, anyone will get used to it and either do spins to untangle or get a pulley system in place to help. But experiencing the TP Cast, and then the Quest 1 coming out, followed shortly by the Quest 2 and then Virtual Desktop\u2026.that was the game changer for me.\n\nSo I had a the Index for a year before the Quest 2, and I purchased (and returned) a Rift S in the meantime. There were noticeable improvements for me that made me put away the Index.\n\n1.) The Rift S and the Quest 2 (and also Quest 1) has a much better play space defining mechanic. As another user mentioned, the friction of getting into VR when a base station changes or needs adjustment, or having to reset steam VR. I would have to drag my wand or knuckle controller physically around my play space. [Yes, I sound like an old man, but the Oculus devices made that setup process feel very Apple-simple of point-click-drag-done.]\n\n2.) Wireless. I can spin around, I don\u2019t have to worry about tripping over my cord, I don\u2019t have to worry about my dog or cats becoming curious about a cable and needing to replace a damaged cable or headset. If I needed to put away my headset and cords, that was just another barrier to entry when it came to playing VR. With wireless I could pop the headset on a shelf, or in a case and be good.\n\n2a) Wireless that doesn\u2019t have to be in the same room. I\u2019m not limited to the 60GHZ wireless TPCAST connection that is line-of-sight, now I can just use the network Wi-Fi in the master bedroom to play walkabout mini golf, or move to the larger play space if something like Gorn is on the menu.\n\n3) The ability to also just play standalone titles. With the simplicity of the oculus setup, then the ability to just bring a headset with me (not a PC, basestations, etc) to use it while traveling or showing friends/family. I can boot up a less graphically impressive version of After the Fall to play on the go, but when I get home, I can play the PCVR version with the enhanced graphics and lighting.\n\nThis has probably gone way off the rails, but I hope you have at least gotten a little bit of enjoyment out of it. If I had to boil me hanging up (and selling) the Index headset in favor of the Meta Quest Pro, it would probably be the high quality visuals combined with the low friction of getting in and out of VR quickly and easily. This doesn\u2019t even go into face tracking, or eye tracking\n\nA last thing I will mention is the comfort. The Meta Quest Pro is fine, for my head. I don\u2019t have any pain using the headset for a few hours. The Index is more comfortable. The materials used on the Index, the fabric that touches your skin are more premium. The front can be removed, washed, replaced via the magnetic gasket. The Quest Pro is just snapped in and uses a leatherette type material that doesn\u2019t absorb sweat, but isn\u2019t as comfortable.", "edited": 1669840550.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long reply incoming, but I will start with short answers to your questions and expand afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have used both platforms.
