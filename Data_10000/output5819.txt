playing compactsky and don't have access to matter overdrive reactors,\n\nmy progression was roughly this:\n\ntier 1: obsidian generator using the block that turns water source blocks into obsidian, block breaker from industrial foregoing to harvest them, cyclic melters to melt the obsidian into lava, then a number of geothermal generators to create power, i generated \\~2000 rf/t with 10 geothermals\n\ntier 2: mekanism furnace fully upgraded to cook the excess logs from bonsai tree farm into charcoal, autocraft into charcoal blocks, then feed into industrial foregoing petrified fuel generators, i can run around 20 of them off of my bonsai farm for 16,000 rf/t\n\ntier 3: nuclearcraft fusion reactor, size 3\n\npretty much the biggest i can make it in a compact machine, and the way i have it set up it runs in 3 \"modes\"\n\nIdle: Generates \\~100,000 rf/t fusing hydrogen+hydrogen into deuterium, storing the deuterium in a black hole tank.\n\nDeuterium: Generates \\~300,000 rf/t fusing hydrogen+deuterium into helium-3, storing the helium-3 in a secondary black hole tank while the deuterium drains out into the reactor\n\nHelium-3: generates \\~900,000 rf/t fusing hydrogen+helium-3 into helium, storing the helium in the secondary black hole tank.\n\nOnce helium-3 runs out, the helium is voided and the reactor switches back to idle.\n\nWith this setup i can produce enough power to get the empowered parabox to \\~63 points per run without supervision, as the entire cycle is autonomous.\n\ni just need to switch the reactor to not overflow the hydrogen for long enough that the internal buffer drains completely, then back to allow overflow.\n\nThe rest is entirely automated, though i'm using a small opencomputers script to turn off the reactor initially, as it needs to cool down a lot for the deuterium fusion and active cooling doesn't work for that (even at 130% cooling rate the temperature would keep increasing)\n\nFor a tier 4 i might try to make a build that i've planned out a reality where i have a massive molten salt reactor into several heat exchangers for steam, into a massive mekanism turbine, but using AE as an intermediate for storing

far produces 38400 H/t, which translates into (if i'm getting this correct) 170,000 mb/t of steam.  \nIt should produce around 12 million rf/t once it's completely up and running, while consuming less than 1 mb/t of molten u-235 fuel (so on 1 solid U-235 fuel pellet it can run for about a minute)", "edited": 1608838783.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null,

have access to matter overdrive reactors,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my progression was roughly this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tier 1: obsidian generator using the block that turns water source blocks into obsidian, block breaker from industrial foregoing to harvest them, cyclic melters to melt the obsidian into lava, then a number of geothermal generators to create power, i generated ~2000 rf/t with 10 geothermals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tier 2: mekanism furnace fully upgraded to cook the excess logs from bonsai tree farm into charcoal, autocraft into charcoal blocks, then feed into industrial foregoing petrified fuel generators, i can run around 20 of them off of my bonsai farm for 16,000 rf/t&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tier 3: nuclearcraft fusion reactor, size 3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;pretty much the biggest i can make it in a compact machine, and the way i have it set up it runs in 3 &amp;quot;modes&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idle: Generates ~100,000 rf/t fusing hydrogen+hydrogen into deuterium, storing the deuterium in a black hole tank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deuterium: Generates ~300,000 rf/t fusing hydrogen+deuterium into helium-3, storing the helium-3 in a secondary black hole tank while the deuterium drains out into the reactor&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Helium-3: generates ~900,000 rf/t fusing hydrogen+helium-3 into helium, storing the helium in the secondary black hole tank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once helium-3 runs out, the helium is voided and the reactor switches back to idle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this setup i can produce enough power to get the empowered parabox to ~63 points per run without supervision, as the entire cycle is autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i just need to switch the reactor to not overflow the hydrogen for long enough that the internal buffer drains completely, then back to allow overflow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rest is entirely automated, though i&amp;#39;m using a small opencomputers script to turn off the reactor
