Maybe he showed he was a good listener, a caretaker, community oriented, practices reciprocity, or seemed like a great human after the conversation. \n\nNope. Went over all of that. (Again, we spent over an hour talking about this in a car ride.)\n\nIt came down to one statement made her feel uncomfortable and the next one made her feel special. \n\n&gt;Maybe he showed he was a good listener, a caretaker, community oriented, practices reciprocity, or seemed like a great human after the conversation. \n\nThat's how they were conversing in the first place. At this point, it was hours in. This isn't about how they met or connected. It's about why: \n\n* \"Would it be okay if I kissed you?\" = Creepy \n* \"I would like to kiss you.\" = Attractive  \n\nI would propose that you could take four women, go through the same events, and all four would come to differing conclusions. First one is creepy, second is attractive; first one is attractive, second one is creepy; both are creepy; both are attractive. \n\nAnd this falls into the \"women are not a monolith.\" Which I agree... But somehow they still want men to treat them like a monolith in that we're supposed to be able to read all of your minds equally. \n\n&gt;What works on men rarely works on women. You need to know your audience.\n\nThat wasn't my intent. My intent was: \n\nYou say look for enthusiastic consent (and I 100% agree and support this; if anything I'm the one trying to point out to women... please, we need enthusiastic consent, for my sake I need that), but I'm pointing out that doesn't actually happen, not the way you think it does. I'm *all for enthusiastic consent*, and I just gave you an example of what that *actually* looks like.\n\nThis is what enthusiastic consent looks like: \n\n* \"Hey, just to be clear. I think you're hot and I want to have sex with you tonight.\" \n\n*That* is enthusiastic consent. That is \"if it's not a hell yes, it's a hell no.\" Anything less than that above is a \"hell no.\"\n\nWhat women *think* they are portraying as interest is indistinguishable from disinterest or just being friendly. \n\nFor instance: I was a server/bartender for most of my 20s and early 30s. Yes, we flirt the hell out of things because it gets us tips. And yes, I would also flirt with girls that I found attractive. However, I also knew that even though the intent was different in my head, the actual presentation was indistinguishable. \n\nI *had* to leave some sort of unmistakable sign that could not be translated as \"just being nice because he's serving you and wants your tips.\" The difference is that I was consciously aware of that and acted accordingly. I made the adjustments to showcase the difference between just flirting for tips and actually flirting, I had to add another variable or action because until that addition...

Went over all of that. (Again, we spent over an hour talking about this in a car ride.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It came down to one statement made her feel uncomfortable and the next one made her feel special. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe he showed he was a good listener, a caretaker, community oriented, practices reciprocity, or seemed like a great human after the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s how they were conversing in the first place. At this point, it was hours in. This isn&amp;#39;t about how they met or connected. It&amp;#39;s about why: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Would it be okay if I kissed you?&amp;quot; = Creepy &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;I would like to kiss you.&amp;quot; = Attractive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would propose that you could take four women, go through the same events, and all four would come to differing conclusions. First one is creepy, second is attractive; first one is attractive, second one is creepy; both are creepy; both are attractive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this falls into the &amp;quot;women are not a monolith.&amp;quot; Which I agree... But somehow they still want men to treat them like a monolith in that we&amp;#39;re supposed to be able to read all of your minds equally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What works on men rarely works on women. You need to know your audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That wasn&amp;#39;t my intent. My intent was: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You say look for enthusiastic consent (and I 100% agree and support this; if anything I&amp;#39;m the one trying to point out to women... please, we need enthusiastic consent, for my sake I need that), but I&amp;#39;m pointing out that doesn&amp;#39;t actually happen, not the way you think it does. I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;all for enthusiastic consent&lt;/em&gt;, and I just gave you an example of what that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what enthusiastic consent looks like: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, just to be clear. I think you&amp;#39;re hot and I want to have sex with you tonight.&amp;quot; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is enthusiastic consent. That is &amp;quot;if it&amp;#39;s not a hell yes, it&amp;#39;s a hell no.&amp;quot; Anything less than that above is a &amp;quot;hell no.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What women &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they are portraying as interest is indistinguishable from disinterest or just being friendly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For instance: I was a server/bartender for most of my 20s and early 30s. Yes, we flirt the hell out of things because it gets us tips. And yes, I would also flirt with girls that I found attractive. However, I also knew that even though the intent was different in my head, the actual presentation was indistinguishable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to leave some sort of unmistakable sign that could not be translated as &amp;quot;just being nice because he&amp;#39;s serving you and wants your tips.&amp;quot; The difference is that I was consciously aware of that and acted accordingly. I made the adjustments to showcase the difference between just flirting for tips and actually flirting, I had to add another variable or action because until that addition... It&amp;#39;s the same appearance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the intent is exclusively in your head and your actions (not you personally, but women in general) are exactly the same when you&amp;#39;re interested or just being friendly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point still stands that any action or statement will be seen as attractive/assertive from a man she&amp;#39;s already interested in, but the exact same action or statement will be seen as creepy from a man she&amp;#39;s not already interested in.

That's not what I'm talking about, at all. We're not talking about those.\n\nI'm taking about the big middle grey area in which is unknown, and women don't always any substantive sign for interest, or they do only in ways that can also be excused as just being friendly. We're talking about when the same thing works one time and doesn't another, with no explanation as to why. I'll give you a couple of real life examples:\n\nFirst: Guy and a girl were talking for a while, he said: \"would it be okay if I kissed you?\" She wasn't into it and declined. \n\nAbout an hour later he said: \"I'd still really like to kiss you.\" And she said it made her feel special and accepted, and they later hooked up.\n\nWe talked about this for about an hour in the car on a road trip. And said the first one made her feel gross but the second time made her feel special. They weren't drinking, it's not like she loosened up after alcohol. What? I still have no idea what the difference was.\n\nI'm not asking you to read her mind, but if you have insight as to why one was creepy and the other was sweet, I'm all ears.\n\nSecond: I already mentioned hearing my friend tell a story about how she was absolutely gushing, like fanning her face blushing, over a guy using the \"I like that beret, it looks good on you. It'd look better on my floor.\" How many times have we heard about how horrible pickup lines are? Especially that one? And it was in a larger conversation about how lame pickup lines are, and she was sharing hour this one time or was so hot that a guy used that one. \n\nHe was attractive, sure, she mentioned that. But is that it? Pickup lines are gross unless it's from a hot guy? \n\nI will ask her about that one sometimes. She still doesn't see it as a problem or a conflict in logical consistency that she can hate pickup lines in bars but that time it was so hot.\n\nI have many many more, but this is getting long and I doubt you even read this far.\n\n&gt;If you have that many female friends that \"talk non-stop shit behind men's backs,\" then you are hanging around with the wrong type of people. Why would you want to surround yourself with negative women who do nothing but complain and talk shit about people?\n\nYou're not getting it. \n\nI have *never* met a woman or group of women that don't do this once they're comfortable with people. I truly believe women do not notice how they talk shit on men, it's just ingrained culturally that it's acceptable.\n\nThis is also individually, women share with their friends some shockingly private details about their husbands/boyfriend/dates that men would never dream of sharing about their wives/girlfriends/dates. You may not personally, but you have to at least know that most women talk about their sex life, including partners penises and performance. It freaked me out to find out the first time that my girlfriend talked about that to her friends, and every girlfriend/partner after has revealed they do too. Shocking rude to do, but it's very commonplace.\n\nIf I refused to hang out with women that do not talk negatively of men in general or refuse to share intimate and private details about their men... I'd be gay and only hang out with gay dudes. Unfortunately, I'm not.\n\nOnce you notice how common it is... Kinda hard to not see it. But if you don't know it happens, you're probably participating and never noticing or caring.\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;No... it's not leave us the fuck alone. That's not what I said at all.\n\nThis directly conflicts with your earlier statement: \n\n&gt; With a smile and a hello. If the response isn't enthusiastic, stop there. That's literally it\n\nSo literally... Never. This is what I'm pointing to... Most women *think* they're sending positive vibes, but they're almost always in ways that can be dismissed as \"just being friendly.\" And that's a no, because it often is actually a no; only the woman knows in her head that it's secretly a \"possible\", but the actions and presentation are the same as the \"not an enthusiastic yes, which is a no.\"\n\nI've only had one woman in my entire life just say what she wanted without playing games and it blew my mind. We became amazing fuck-buddies for months until she moved away.
