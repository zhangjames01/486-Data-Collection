It sounds super weird, like you\u2019re encouraging parents only to punish children, never reward them?

So letting kids watch tv with extra time born from getting ready early makes sense because it\u2019s extra time they have earned. Letting kids watch tv because they brushed their teeth would not make sense because those two things aren\u2019t connected.\n\nHowever, children often don\u2019t understand delayed benefits of an action (i.e. brushing their teeth will keep their teeth healthy and not rotten) because their brain hasn\u2019t developed the necessary areas fully enough to understand. So parents are encouraged to bridge this gap so that children learn that good behavior does reward them, and as they get older, the rewards relate more and more to the real world benefits.\n\nFor example, a teen may understand that if they don\u2019t dress themselves, their friends will see their pjs and judge them. Also being better dressed will give them benefits in their social circle. A younger child won\u2019t fully understand that pjs are for inside the house, nor the benefits of being well dressed, and so won\u2019t understand why its bad to not be properly dressed. This is why you (usually) don\u2019t need to reward a teen for simply dressing themselves, but you do need to for a younger child. You do however need to sometimes moderate what a teen is wearing. They may not fully understand the consequences of what they\u2019re wearing, just that it fits in with their friend group. Once again, this is where the parent steps in and rewards or punishes appropriately based on culture and parenting styles.

Most therapists are not prepared to handle people who suffer with delusions or are detached from reality like it sounds like Bev is. However the therapist needs to point that out to the mother so Bev can get a psychologist or psychiatrist who CAN handle Bev\u2019s issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it is, it sounds like OOP wasn\u2019t the healthiest mom, but that she was trying. Bev just needed a LOT more than simply a talk therapist, and no one realized that until too late for a mix of reasons\u2014including that the therapist may not have been taking Bev very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, if your child has a therapist, make sure you\u2019re keeping up communication with them.

One thing is that your guilt is perfectly normal. That may sound weird and backwards compared to what others have said--but hear me out. It's perfectly normal to feel guilty even when something isn't your fault. You have nothing to be guilty of, but it's okay that you feel that way. Emotions don't have to be logical, they're just there. People can tell you until they're blue in the face not to feel guilty, but you still may feel guilty--and THAT'S OKAY. It's important that you logically understand it's not your fault, but your emotions may need extra time to come to the same conclusion.\n\nThat said, somethings that may help relieve that guilt (which again, you don't have to feel, but if you do, these actions may help subdue it) are caring for your gf's bruise. Get her some ice and a towel and ask if she needs painkillers. Taking care of the physical reminders of an emotion can help untangle the emotion and smooth it down. You don't need to apologize, but you can thank her for her help and seek to do something nice for her. As a people pleaser, doing nice things for others sometimes helps me get out of my own brain. But if that doesn't work for you, also make sure you're taking care of yourself. Comfort items and warm drinks/foods are good ideas right now to help calm down your body and deal with the recovery from a PTSD trigger. Taking care of yourself also helps take stress off of her, as she may need time to sort herself as well. But it's also perfectly fine if you both just cuddle up together for comfort and take care of each other.\n\nA less immediate thing to do to help, is to make sure your gf has a support network. You said she's talking to a discord friend, that's good. Having other friends and a support network means that she can work through if she did have any emotions about your PTSD reaction, as well as receive advice (if appropriate) and her own support. This is very good, because right now you need her support. Later on, when you're supporting her through something, also make sure you reach out to a support network for the same reasons. Humans aren't meant to be islands, we're meant to help one another and two people alone don't make a good foundation.\n\nMental health can be scary, but having good friends and good partners means that the support is being supported and everyone can handle shit a lot easier.\n\nAlso not immediate, but important, is that as part of a support network, having a good professional such as a therapist is important so that the support network's support stays healthy and you have guidance in how to recover. So if you're able to/can afford/have access to therapy, I would highly recommend seeking it out if you haven't already.\n\nHopefully some of this helps.
