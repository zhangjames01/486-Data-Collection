If and when you're ejected from a vehicle during an accident, you will sustain more serious injuries due to the decisions you independently made.\n\nObviously this isn't the case because we understand that societal resources will be used to manage the fallout from your poor choice. If you become paralyzed, fall into a vegetative state, or are otherwise unable to look after yourself because of this accident, society will intervene and you become a cost to everyone.\n\nHealthcare systems around the world currently rely upon healthy people to subsidize sick people. Until that is fundamentally changed, there will be a pressure to decrease obesity-related costs, which currently cost the US [hundreds of billions of dollars](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/economic/).\n\nNow as far as how we go about that, I 100% agree that shaming people is not only immoral, but counterproductive. Studies show that negative reinforcement is a poor motivator to help people manage weight-related illnesses.

So have Viserion spilling blue dragonfire (the same way he did at the very end of the episode) and show Drogon/Rhaegal spilling red dragonfire. You instantly add visual clarity without even changing the surrounding gloom and you can even add &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; tension by doing this because the audience can finally tell when their dragon is on the bottom of the fight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about the battle&amp;#39;s most memorable moments. Jorah leading the fire-arakh-wielding Dothraki charge while flamming shot flies overhead, the dragons &lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bqpfpiq7y7v21.jpg?width=960&amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c001212a19013d77bbf0daf3557806bd00023626\"&gt;breaking free&lt;/a&gt; of the fog, the dragons &lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/lKURuXt.jpg\"&gt;strafing&lt;/a&gt; the wights. These scenes still conveyed fear because you can see the Dothraki lights extinguished. You can worry about an ice spear striking a dragon from the fog below. You can see the tide of icy fog creep forward unabated by fire. Light and contrast allow for visual clarity which you can use for suspense.
