You get better at interviews but your resume gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is that most unemployed folks won&amp;#39;t considering doing those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I disagree but if that&amp;#39;s true, that&amp;#39;s a good thing. The people that need work should be able to get work but that&amp;#39;s not happening right now as much as you may think. If anyone is getting work, it should be the people that need to in order to survive instead of 28 year old guy living with his parents taking a min wage job from a guy that is trying to pay his own bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2ihz5m", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/funny/comments/2ihz5m/my_experience_after_9_months_of_unemployment/cl34o1a/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2ihz5m/my_experience_after_9_months_of_unemployment/", "name": "t1_cl34o1a", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funny", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1412713154.0, "created_utc": 1412713154.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.imgur.com/tc5h8Tu.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "My experience after 9 months of unemployment", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "funny", "link_author": "juanjoli", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cl2mqdi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "throwaway983524", "num_comments": 2537, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cl2ia67", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_bn8uq", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, the going door-to-door strategy does not work anymore.
