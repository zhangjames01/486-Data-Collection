Noting the the latter is just an example of the former, helps dodge a lot of needless seeking around (which can be fun, but it&amp;#39;s nice to have the choice to do it or not without misunderstanding what such a &amp;quot;seeking experience&amp;quot; is).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_cn5lm4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DimensionJumping/comments/cn5lm4/randomly_stumbled_on_this_guys_posts/exb062v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DimensionJumping/comments/cn5lm4/randomly_stumbled_on_this_guys_posts/", "name": "t1_exb062v", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DimensionJumping", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1566119822.0, "created_utc": 1566119822.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DimensionJumping/comments/cn5lm4/randomly_stumbled_on_this_guys_posts/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3gmet", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Randomly stumbled on this guy's posts...", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DimensionJumping", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ew7enjx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TriumphantGeorge", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ew75ysy", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_hxmy6", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This sub is not actually a direct sequel to the other one.
