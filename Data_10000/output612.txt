To suffer through real adversity that no mortal man seemingly could and still triumph is the literal backbone of American sports history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of other reasons too but the biggest reason is the over exaggerated time wasting fake injuries that is just antithetical to the foundational elements that Americans widely love about sports. Its seen as weak, cheap, and ( for lack of a better term) &amp;quot;pussy&amp;quot; behavior. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its one thing to embellish a foul to gain advantage but its entirely different for a player to scream like they were just shot and deathroll on the ground like their leg is broken, waste game time, all from minimal or sometimes no contact and then get up and run another couple of miles like nothing happened. The &amp;quot;gamesmanship&amp;quot; just isn&amp;#39;t something most American&amp;#39;s dislike, the distain for it is ingrained in our sports culture and history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_z7hj92", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ussoccer/comments/z7hj92/i_dont_understand_why_americans_love_to_hate_on/iy6vdcl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ussoccer/comments/z7hj92/i_dont_understand_why_americans_love_to_hate_on/", "name": "t1_iy6vdcl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ussoccer", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1669696245.0, "created_utc": 1669696245.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ussoccer/comments/z7hj92/i_dont_understand_why_americans_love_to_hate_on/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r1rw", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What passage gives illegal non-citizens constitutional rights?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 7, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "supremecourt", "link_author": "Overt__", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iwdw31p", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "I_am_just_saying", "num_comments": 180, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_yv30vb", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_73i36", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Outside of the discussion on Locke's natural rights of man or divine rights that you and others have touched on it is perhaps better/easier to think of the codified negative rights outlined in the constitution as restrictions on what the government can not do. \n\nIts not that illegals or non citizens get the same rights or certain rights its much more that the restrictions on the State (what many people can call \"rights\") are so broad and strong that they still apply regardless of citizenship status.\n\nTo be clear I'm not specifically advocating for a position one way or another but I think that the question is more clear when asked \"In what situations and context does the (insert specific government restriction/amendment) not apply, and why?
