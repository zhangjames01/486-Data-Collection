It was *intense.* I saw palliative care, neuro, trauma, cardiology, med-surg, and oncology. I had some issues with palliative care - I don't do well with death. But really the major intensity of it was the pace. I wore a FitBit and usually in psych I average 7k steps a day at work. On medicine, I was hitting 10k by lunchtime.\n\nAnyway, I had many conversations with the social workers over there about what life is like as a social worker on medicine and they all told me - especially the ones who have done psych or outpatient - they wouldn't trade their jobs for anything. They love it. They like the high velocity days, solving problems, finding placements, helping families, and the teams they work on.\n\nDo you have any opportunities to job shadow?
