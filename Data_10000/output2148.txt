We have a loooooong history, but have never really been able to make it work in an actual relationship. There was a lot of built up sexual tension because we had been talking and texting for a while and I had been adamant that we needed to keep it platonic b/c I was in a LTR. Also, I had been his first back in HS, and he's always told me that meant a lot to him.\n\nAnyway, I was over at his place hanging out, and was in a bad place in my relationship. He was really supportive and a good listener, without crossing the line. We were in his hot tub, drinking a little, and pretty much sharing stories after not having hung out for several years. It was really intimate, and we had the chance to talk a little about why things never worked out for us in the past. \n\nAfter the hot tub, we cuddled on the couch and watched a movie. It was very comfortable, but still a lot of sexual tension. He put his arm around me and was kind of stroking my back and neck. I leaned into him, put my hand on his leg, and we ended up kissing. We made out for probably 30-45 minutes, clothes on, and of course we were both getting really worked up. At one point we ended up on the floor, with me on top of him straddling his waist as we continued to kiss. \n\nI suggested we move to his bedroom, still not sure at this point how far I was going to let it go. Once in his bed, we continued to kiss and he asked me if he could go down on me and I said yes. It was amazing, of course, and something that my bf had kind of stopped doing without me asking him to do so, so it felt really good not to have to initiate to receive. As he made me cum with his mouth, I knew we were going to fuck.\n\nI can't even remember how we transitioned to sex, but I remember at one point he was lying back on his bed with his clothes off, and I got my first real good look at his dick - it was huge. I'm really bad at estimating size, but suffice it to say it was the largest I had ever seen IRL, even when we had been together in HS. I think I even said something like \"Holy crap, I don't remember you being that big in HS,\" and he said something like he wasn't even all the way hard yet. (Per the interwebs, men's penises can keep growing until the end of puberty - so I guess he had a growth spurt after age 17 when we had been together before.)\n\nI never considered myself a size queen; my three LTR relationships have all been average, and that has always been just fine for me. In fact, I probably have shied away from large endowments in the past, because I have sometimes had trouble with tightness, especially if I haven't had sex for a couple of weeks. But as ready to go as I was, there was definitely no room for trepidation!\n\nI told him that I wanted him to fuck me. He rolled over on top of me and we started going. At first missionary, while I played with my clit and gave myself a couple more orgasms. We then switched to me on top, but only for a short time because he needed more control to be able to pull out when needed since we weren't using any protection and I was not on the pill. Finally we ended up going at it doggy style (my fave). At this point I am not even playing with my clit because I've had 3-4 orgasms already, but am still definitely enjoying the ride. \n\nI know there are probably lots of (lucky) girls out there who climax easily from penetration alone, but that has never really been my experience. I think it has happened to me once or twice in the past, but it has always been so much easier to climax through clitoral stimulation while being penetrated that that has been my go-to. But that night, whether it was his size, the angle, the pent-up sexual tension, or a mixture of the three, I came so hard while he was pounding me from behind. I could feel my body seize up and waves of sensation pass through me. The muscular contractions in my pussy almost literally pushed his cock out of me (he even commented on it after we were done, so I know it was not my imagination). This happened probably about 2-3 times over the next 5-10 minutes as he continued to fuck me. \n\nI have never felt anything like it before or since, and it definitely goes down as the best sexual experience of my life. As an added bonus, it is a lot easier for me to cum from penetration alone now, even with more moderately endowed men. Not every time, but I'll take it!\n\nTL;DR - I had sex with an ex with whom I have a lot of history.
