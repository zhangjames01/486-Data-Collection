The author of the next study &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t want to publish his findings but couldn&amp;#39;t find a way around the results:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/world/americas/05iht-diversity.1.6986248.html\"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/world/americas/05iht-diversity.1.6986248.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But even after statistically taking them all into account, the connection remained strong: Higher diversity meant lower social capital. In his findings, Putnam writes that those in more diverse communities tend to &amp;quot;distrust their neighbors, regardless of the color of their skin, to withdraw even from close friends, to expect the worst from their community and its leaders, to volunteer less, give less to charity and work on community projects less often, to register to vote less, to agitate for social reform more but have less faith that they can actually make a difference, and to huddle unhappily in front of the television.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, Glaeser and colleague Alberto Alesina demonstrated that roughly half the difference in social welfare spending between the US and Europe -- Europe spends far more -- can be attributed to the greater ethnic diversity of the US population. Glaeser says lower national social welfare spending in the US is a &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot; version of the decreased civic engagement Putnam found in more diverse communities within the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11u5evq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/11u5evq/and_then_for_reason_at_al_shut_the_fuck_up/jcntosj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/11u5evq/and_then_for_reason_at_al_shut_the_fuck_up/", "name": "t1_jcntosj", "author_flair_template_id": "42a2355c-e950-11e9-b1c0-0ecdd039149e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PoliticalCompassMemes", "author_flair_text": ":right: - Right", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679114661.0, "created_utc": 1679114661.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/b9dzxr23cdoa1.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3ipa1", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "An explanation of the Rosa Parks story in a Florida textbook.
