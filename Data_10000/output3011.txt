I love babies, I adore 3 year olds. They're so much fun. I actually just got a job working in a preschool and I've been dancing around, so happy. I've wanted babies for years, a very overwhelming urge that most people think is a bit crazy- including my husband. As a teen, I couldn't wait to have children. But then something changed: my sister got purposefully pregnant as a teenager.\n\nMy sister had a lot of problems, which I don't need to go into, but she was convinced her boyfriend was the love of her life and if they had the baby their parents would all say \"OK you can get married\". Yeah none of that happened, their relationship fell apart before the baby came. (Note I'm not saying your relationship is doomed, but seriously how long have you been with this man? It would really be a good idea to have a few years together. From all my friends have told me, after a baby comes your relationship changes and you would be glad to have those first few years alone together.) Anyway, when my niece was 2 months old, my sister got back into drugs and partying and I became the default child sitter. \n\nAs my sister got more and more into drugs and feeding her addiction, I got the baby. The \"joys\" of parenthood as a teen shocked me. I **couldn't** go out with friends. I **never** had friends over. ALL day at school I was constantly thinking of the baby at home, worrying about her safety. The second I came home from school, I got handed a baby. I played with her and yeah I did enjoy that time. But until I put her to bed at 8/9, I didn't have a life of my own. I didn't talk to my friends; I didn't make or receive phone calls; I didn't get online; I didn't do my homework; I had no time for myself. After putting her to bed, I would do my homework, waiting for my sister to come crawling home and only falling asleep when I heard her. I ended up averaging 4-5 hours of sleep at night. During the weekends, if I was lucky I got to escape. With my mom there, my sister wouldn't party as hard. So I would be able to spend a night with friends. But these times were few and far between, and again I would constantly worry about that baby girl at home. I knew my sister was a shitty, addicted mother and didn't want my niece involved with whatever she was into. When my sister went into rehab, my mom took custody for the time and still I was there because my mom couldn't do it all herself. I would wake up with her every morning and get her ready for the day- wrestling a screaming child into clothes at 6 am is not fun. Because my mom sometimes couldn't get out of work to take care of her: I dropped out of fast pitch, I skipped school when she was sick, I took her to the doctors on the bus (which is a royal pain with a 4 year old!), I took her to band practice and other things that seriously a 4 year old doesn't want to be at. And the entire time I was out with her, I would get looks. Side-long glances, whispers and even a dick or two actually coming out and saying something like \"babies having babies, ugh!\"  or \"Are you easy? I heard all teen moms are easy.\" I was seen as a slut for caring for my niece. I knew it wasn't true, but it was hurtful. \n\nSocially, having a baby even part time was hard. Whatever little childhood I had, whatever freedom I had to think and be myself was taken away. I was constantly stressed and none of my friends understood. \"Why don't you just say no?\"; \"You don't always have to babysit for her.\" How do I explain that I couldn't- that yes, in fact I did have to be there? I found myself withdrawing from these friends and visa versa because all I did was stress and never hung out with them, and they couldn't understand what I was going through. It caused a lot of strain and fights with friends. Looking back I can't blame them- they were teenagers, not ready to deal with that bullshit. And they and I shouldn't have had to. Now this doesn't including the hours of screaming and crying that will inevitably happen. My niece was an awesome baby- what they actually call an \"easy baby\". Now it's been a while since I studied babies for my degree (in Early Childhood Education) but I think they said something like 30% of babies are \"easy\" and 30% are \"difficult\"- often with colic. So you have up to a 30% chance of having a child with colic which can last the first 6 months. I was fortunate enough to take care of an easy baby and it still wasn't easy. There was screaming, there was night terrors, there was cave paintings with shit. There was throwing of food, coloring on walls, pooping in the bathtub, vomit and diarrhea. All that is all normal and very, very stressful to deal with. I can't imagine how hard a more difficult baby would be to deal with. \n\nNow what does that mean for you- well you hun, have the baby full time. Yes there are moms who have friends- they're often moms too. Because unless you've had one, it's hard to understand how much time, effort, and stress a baby takes. Yes there is joy, but it is fucking hard. You won't sleep. You won't eat well. You will not see your friends for potentially months on end. It is possible you could lose friends. You could find yourself depressed and alone. Even with a good partner, being young and not being able to do what your friends are doing will get to you. You could be angry, you could be sad- but there will be a time where you would wish you waited. And trying to study on top of it?? My mom did that. She went back to college after I (the baby) started school and she told me, \"it was the hardest thing I've ever done- I wish I did it earlier.\" Those four years I barely saw her. My siblings would get me ready for school and take care of me after, and my mom would come home around 7ish. She would spend maybe a few minutes talking to us before she had to study. High school was hard enough, I have no fucking clue how she did university. Doing university myself, I think she's super woman. I don't know how she didn't go crazy. \n\nThis is just the stress too. That doesn't take into account the finances. Disposable diapers can be like 30 dollars a box easy, baby may go through that in a couple week they could go through that in a few days. And non-disposable diapers. SO MUCH FUN- until they go through all the clean ones you have because they have explosive diarrhea and you haven't been able to get five seconds to do a single load of laundry so you end up wrapping them in a towel. If you decide to do formula or can't breast feed- dear god the formula is extortion! It's shocking how much they charge for something so necessary. Then there is the trips to the doctors, the trips to the ER, the crib, the clothes, the blankets, the rent deposit/fixing cost after they drew all over the walls or shat on the floor, the car seats, booster seats, little cute training toilets, adorable toys, the babysitter (who often charge 10 dollars an hour if they're cheap)... seriously the list goes on and on. There is a reason they say it takes *thousands of dollars every single year*. And this is a developmentally typical child. A special needs child, which believe you me happens a lot more than you probably think, costs hundreds of thousands of dollars more. Now if you can afford that, have no doubt about job security, no fear that your partner could leave/die and leave you with nothing but a high school degree and no career experience (which happened to my aunt- who had to declare bankruptcy and got evicted after my uncle passed away young).. well that is awesome. In fact I'm honestly a little jealous. Even in a country that guarantees paid maternity leave, free medical coverage, reduced dental for under 18's, has a wonderful tertiary support network, and an awesome welfare system if god forbid anything happens to my husband's really good job- my husband and I have been waiting and saving for *years*. And after being together for as long as we have, I'm confident that we'll be ok once babies come along. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous about it all. And that's just the baby part- not pregnancy. Pregnancy honestly terrifies me. Your body changes so much, and so many things can go wrong.. it's scary. \n\n**TL;DR: my advice- wait.** Having a small taste of mother hood as a teenager- while I love my niece and I'm very glad to have that time with her- was some of the hardest, most stressful, most frustrating, and darkest time of my life. Now what can you do to deal with the baby cravings, which I promise I understand better than most... babysit. Get the credentials to become a nanny. Try to work or volunteer in a daycare or preschool. You can do these part time as you get your education. It's not the same, but you will find that it helps. And if none of that even makes a dent in it- get counseling. In the end you'll be glad you waited.

And after being together for as long as we have, I&amp;#39;m confident that we&amp;#39;ll be ok once babies come along. But I&amp;#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&amp;#39;t a little nervous about it all. And that&amp;#39;s just the baby part- not pregnancy. Pregnancy honestly terrifies me. Your body changes so much, and so many things can go wrong.. it&amp;#39;s scary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: my advice- wait.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a small taste of mother hood as a teenager- while I love my niece and I&amp;#39;m very glad to have that time with her- was some of the hardest, most stressful, most frustrating, and darkest time of my life. Now what can you do to deal with the baby cravings, which I promise I understand better than most... babysit. Get the credentials to become a nanny. Try to work or volunteer in a daycare or preschool. You can do these part time as you get your education. It&amp;#39;s not the same, but you will find that it helps. And if none of that even makes a dent in it- get counseling. In the end you&amp;#39;ll be glad you waited. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2h2o1c", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2h2o1c/seventeen_and_wanting_to_be_a_mom/ckoxo93/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2h2o1c/seventeen_and_wanting_to_be_a_mom/", "name": "t1_ckoxo93", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1411349693.0, "created_utc": 1411349693.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 500, "id": "gid_2", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 100, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png", "days_of_premium": 7, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Gives 100 Reddit Coins and a week of r/lounge access and ad-free browsing.", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Gold", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png"}], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2h2o1c/seventeen_and_wanting_to_be_a_mom/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How do I tell my kids WHY their biological father is in prison?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Parenting", "link_author": "imusingsarcasmfont", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cknjfow", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Ducky9202", "num_comments": 70, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_2gwjgc", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_78gie", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My own father was caught attempting to rape my elder half sister right after I was born.

I would definitely recommend it, but use caution for all parties. Some things about my experience:\n\nFor me, it did start out mainly as a curiosity thing. I was still getting over an ex, but the theme of the dating site peaked my interest. So I joined and I put my file to \"looking for friends\" only. However, being a lady on these dating sites is honestly scary. I got messaged tons -nothing as bad as creepy pms, but seriously it gets a little overwhelming. And lets admit it, I'm so not a 10 and I'm still getting a tremendous amount of attention so god help you if you're a lady rocking a hot body. I mean- you have the guys who know nothing about you just messaging you - some looking for sex, some creepy as fuck, and then the one or two that are worth the time and effort. And even after you put in that time, you still may end up with just a friend. Which could be cool, but still if that's not what you're looking for that get's a bit old. Additionally, a lot of the messages and people who talk to you do so regardless of whatever you put on your file. Just looking for friends? Oh well this person has decided to try to change your decision by sending strange sound things/ inviting you to join them and visit them several states away. Unfortunately you will likely see red flags, just message the mods as needed and they will deal with it. That being said, don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Unless you're willing to make an effort, you won't get anywhere in any relationship. Yes, it can be a little scary, but so is life. Just use common sense- for example: don't give out personal details until you done some googling, meet publicly after getting to know the person and if you are ever even the slightest bit uneasy- don't go/ don't do it/ avoid and block that person. \n\nAnd if you're a guy- honestly I \"initiated\" a message once- to my husband. We talked for *hours and hours* on the forums several months before and then we parted ways before I sent him this message out of the blue. He was already familiar and a friend. Part of me never looking through the men and messaging was because I just I went on the website just wanting to talk to people with a similar interest as me (it was one of those theme dating sites) so I was only hanging out and talking to people in the relevant forums. But part of never initiating any other contact was also because I was overwhelmed trying to sort through these random messages from guys. It's not fair, not evening a little, but a lot of ladies on those sites are already a bit jaded because of all the odd messages. No matter how lovely you are as a person, are probably not going to get ladies fawning all over you. You're going to have to work for it. And by that I mean use tact, common decency, words without numbers thrown in them, and common sense. If at all possible don't just send private messages. Because they could get buried, they are easily overlooked (sometimes not highlighted well to show there is new messages), and if your presence is nowhere else on the site, then you're summed up in those few words and may not get a second chance. Head to the forums, if there's meet ups go, be social. This makes you seem like a normal human being and less scary.\n\n**TL;DR** In the end, dating online does not make dating easier. Half-assing your way doesn't work well at anything else, so it won't work very well for dating. You still have to hike through the shit to find someone you are willing to spend time with and you have to make an effort. However, the pool you're looking through is a metric fuck-ton bigger. Seriously my husband and I getting together meant me immigrating to a different country on the other side of the world- so the whole world is now your dating pool thanks to the internet. That is overwhelming, but you can meet some pretty awesome people. And if you're careful picking the dating site- you've potentially got a better chance at finding people who share the same interests as you. Personally, after 6 years of happiness, I think that chance worth it.
