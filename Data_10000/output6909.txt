I checked all the corners, closing the door to make sure debris wasn't hiding behind it. Fortunately my girlfriend Carrie had already done a good bit of cleaning, but had run out of time. *Everything looks pretty good,* I observed. The landlord, a short, balding man named Chet Barnes, struck me as a bit of a stickler when it came to move out inspections. *We need that deposit back.*\n\nMy eyes fell on the tank behind the toilet rim. *I should probably check inside,* I thought, *just in case it's dirty. Chet will probably charge us $20 if he has to clean it.* It was a newer toilet, so I was sure he'd be extra picky. \n\nI pulled the porcelain lid off the tank, and sure enough there was a little bit of residue built up around the line where the water met the air. I grabbed the toilet brush and started scrubbing at the line. It was quick work. As I grabbed the lid to replace it I noticed a folded note on the underside, a single piece of tape running across it diagonally, holding it in place. I peeled it away and unfolded it.

I tried shouting and banging on the doors but no one has come to help, and my cell phone is dead so I can't call you. The lights went out, but fortunately I hadn't taken the candles out of the bathroom yet. I have a headache that seems to be getting worse by the minute. Please help me, Seth. I don't know what's going to happen...\" I looked up and around the empty, off-white bathroom. The note was signed, \"Love, Natalia.\" \n\nI dropped the note to the floor and reached for the door handle. Locked. I pulled my cell phone out of my pocket. Unlike Natalia's, my phone was charged. *Fuck,* I realized, looking at the signal indicator and seeing a large X next to the tower icon. *No signal.* I raised the phone, trying to see if I could connect long enough to call 911 or even send a text to Carrie. Nothing. \n\n\"FUCK,\" I screamed, sitting down on the closed toilet seat. I could feel a growing pressure at the back of my skull, where it met the neck. \"It's just stress,\" I said, talking to no one but hoping the sound of my voice would help me calm down. *Why did I close that God damn door?* I wondered. Sweat formed on my brow. I wiped it away with my forearm.\n\nJust as I was about to stand and try the door again, then put my shoulder into it to see if I could break my way through, the lights went out. There were no windows in the bathroom, so I was immediately plunged into darkness. I reached blindly in the dark and felt along the wall until I found the round door handle again. When my hand connected with it I received an unexpected shock. \"Ow,\" I said involuntarily. *Static electricity?* I wondered, reaching out to touch it again. The shock was just as strong, numbing my arm as I held on for longer than the split second my reflexes wanted to enforce. *No,* I realized as I let go of the handle, *it's an active circuit.*\n\n*What is Chet playing at?* I thought in a panic. I pounded at the door with both fists. \"Chet?\" I cried. \"Are you out there? I will fuck you up if you don't let me out of here, man. Right fucking now!\"\n\nNo response. A hissing noise came from the floor. \"Chet?\" I asked again. My headache was getting worse, and my arm hurt from getting shocked. I pounded one more time at the door. \"Not funny, dude. Please let me out. I'm not... this isn't a joke.\" No response again, but the hissing noise intensified. \n\nMy head pounded in time with my racing heartbeat. I tried to think, but my brain would only thrum in time with my heart. I sunk to the floor, resting my back agains the wall. I felt so weary, so tired, like I just wanted to sleep. *No,* I thought, *stay awake. Don't give up...* \n\nI took two more breaths, then was swallowed by the darkness in the room.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cleaning is always the worst part,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, scrubbing at the tile around the base of the toilet. &lt;em&gt;Every single fucking time.

When my hand connected with it I received an unexpected shock. &amp;quot;Ow,&amp;quot; I said involuntarily. &lt;em&gt;Static electricity?&lt;/em&gt; I wondered, reaching out to touch it again. The shock was just as strong, numbing my arm as I held on for longer than the split second my reflexes wanted to enforce. &lt;em&gt;No,&lt;/em&gt; I realized as I let go of the handle, &lt;em&gt;it&amp;#39;s an active circuit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is Chet playing at?&lt;/em&gt; I thought in a panic. I pounded at the door with both fists. &amp;quot;Chet?&amp;quot; I cried. &amp;quot;Are you out there? I will fuck you up if you don&amp;#39;t let me out of here, man. Right fucking now!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No response. A hissing noise came from the floor. &amp;quot;Chet?&amp;quot; I asked again. My headache was getting worse, and my arm hurt from getting shocked. I pounded one more time at the door. &amp;quot;Not funny, dude. Please let me out. I&amp;#39;m not... this isn&amp;#39;t a joke.&amp;quot; No response again, but the hissing noise intensified. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My head pounded in time with my racing heartbeat. I tried to think, but my brain would only thrum in time with my heart. I sunk to the floor, resting my back agains the wall. I felt so weary, so tired, like I just wanted to sleep. &lt;em&gt;No,&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;stay awake. Don&amp;#39;t give up...&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took two more breaths, then was swallowed by the darkness in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_37ytef", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/37ytef/wp_you_are_cleaning_out_your_apartment_and_you/crrcrr8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/37ytef/wp_you_are_cleaning_out_your_apartment_and_you/", "name": "t1_crrcrr8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1433119418.0, "created_utc": 1433119418.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/37ytef/wp_you_are_cleaning_out_your_apartment_and_you/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rske", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[Pics] [M] The side by side comparison really shows a difference!

It's long but hopefully worth it? If people are interested I can write more...*\n\n&gt; **Oct 29, 1986**: Four years, twelve days\n\nI never expected to lose my life over a phone. A fucking *phone* of all the dumb things. There was this kid--A kid! It's weird how young these kids look to me now, even though I'm only in my mid-30s--who turned to me right as the otherwise empty light rail car pulled up to a vacant platform dimly lit by aged lighting. He turned to me and said, \"Gimme that iPhone, bro.\"\n\nIt was all so casual. So... insignificant. It's not exactly like I'm a Big Deal^TM or anything, but I really thought my last words would be something a bit more impactful. Memorable even. At least funny? Instead they were, \"Haha, what?\" as I looked up from a device that had consumed so many wasted hours and opportunities. Oh, I guess I said, \"Whoa!\" too, because when some scrawny kid is drawing a gun from his hoodie and leveling it at your face, your mind isn't really geared toward eloquence. \n\nThe kid had his finger on the trigger. I didn't really notice it at the time, but again I wasn't in the state of mind to pick up on details. Pretty sure I tried to duck and sort of groaned. I do remember thinking, *Wait,* as if trying to parse whether or not this was actually happening. I guess I took too long for the kid and he was spooked by my movement, because there was a distinct **POP** as the gun spewed smoke and fired. Every time I'd shot guns I was at a range with ear protection. Turns out guns are really fucking loud when they discharge two feet from your ears with nothing in between.\n\nI didn't see the bullet of course, but I did see the casing as it arced to the ground. We followed a similar trajectory. Dying is weird. I can tell you this: I didn't go right away. I felt the kid pull the iPhone from my hand, a blur of grey hoodie and brown unkempt hair and the ceiling of the MAX car my last sights as my vision slowly dimmed to black. What's strange is how much longer I could hear and feel things touching my head, though I guess it's possible my perception of time was a little skewed. I'm not going to talk about it any more because it still freaks me out a little.\n\nAs a pretty convinced atheist, you can imagine my smug satisfaction as all feeling and awareness finally faded to nothing and my life slipped away. It's somewhat difficult to describe nothingness. I've tried some drugs and some sensory deprivation, and the experience was nothing like any of that. There was a distinct peace to it unlike anything I'd ever felt. *Hey, wait a minute,* I thought. *If I feel smug and peaceful, then I still have awareness.*\n\nIt was a frightening realization. Was *this* eternity? *A fate worse than Hell,* I thought, feeling oddly unaffected by the idea of eternal suffering, which would at least be *something* compared to an eternity of total silence and solitude. As I contemplated the lesser of two tortures, a pinpoint of light appeared in the far-off distance. Don't ask me how I saw it without eyes, but I felt, saw, and understood that I was meant to go there.\n\nThe light began growing in my perception, joined by a sound that was reminiscent of wind. The sound intensified as the light grew, rising to a roar. I seemed to be approaching the light quickly, so I tried to slow down through force of will. Within what seemed seconds the light had grown to take up my entire vision, its flat, featureless glow beginning to feel warm. Suddenly I had the most dreadful thought, seeing nothing but white and feeling a searing heat deep within the core of my existence: I knew that whatever this was, it was now unavoidable.\n\nHave you ever seen the movie *Being John Malkovich*? I only ask because what happened was something like that. The light sort of... shattered--Like if pieces of glass could fall away and then disappear--and I found myself sitting in the kitchen of the house on Negley Road, looking down into a bowl of Rice Krispies.\n\n*I always did like Rice Krispies*, I thought. *Wait, WHAT THE FUCK?* I watched as a very small hand lifted a dripping spoon toward my mouth. I tried to say something. I tried to scream. All I could do was shout inside my own head, with the sound of crunching cereal in the background as I chewed. I tried to stop chewing. I tried to wave. I could do nothing. At the edge of my periphery I could see the clock. A quarter til eight.\n\n\"Daniel, are you almost done with your breakfast?\" a voice asked from behind me.\n\n\"Yes, dad,\" I replied. I mean, *I* didn't reply. Again, the experience is a bit hard to describe. I could feel my mouth opening while talking, I could feel my hand moving. I could even feel my teeth crashing together as I ate, the baby-tooth incisor on the lower left tender and probably near falling out. It was *me* in every sense of the word, except I lacked any sort of control.\n\n\"Ready to go to school?\" Dad asked.\n\n\"Do I have to?\" I asked. \"Since it's my birthday and all,\" I finished. My voice sounded so full of hope. *Is this Hell?* I wondered. *Hell is living your own life over without being able to do or say anything at all?* Sounds about right if you ask me.\n\nMy dad chuckled. \"Yes, you have to. Besides, I have to work.\"\n\nThe rest of the day was uneventful for other me, being a typical day in the life of a kindergartner. I found it torturous. I tried all day to affect any sort of control over my younger body without success. Not so much as a wrinkle of the nose or a bend of the finger. I sat through dinner with my dad, screaming inside my own head about how something had happened, how he had to listen to me, trying to say something... anything. No words came. The other me talked about his day and the pointless crap I'd already had to endure once--no wait, technically twice since I'd already lived through it once before. *This time travel shit is confusing,* I thought.\n\nAt last I found myself in bed for the night. My dad tucked me in, gave me a dry kiss on the forehead, and pulled the door closed so there was the smallest sliver of light shining through from the hallway. Other me closed his eyes. *Open your eyes,* I thought. Nothing happened. I tried to move any part of my body. I suddenly thought of my big toe on my left foot. I'm not sure why, but it just popped into my head. The joint on that toe has always cracked, ever since I was a baby.\n\nI focused on my left big toe, forcing all of my attention and energy to that location on my body. *I have to do something,* I thought. *There's no way I'll make it if I have to stay like this.* I was keenly aware of my left big toe, recalling the sound the joint makes when it pops, how it felt sort of like cracking my knuckles, only a bit muffled. I tried with all my might to move the toe. Nothing. \n\n*Fuck,* I yelled in my head, but then realized I could see the sliver of light from the hallway. Other me had opened our eyes! I focused on that sliver of light and again channeled all my effort into cracking the joint on my big toe.\n\nI felt and heard the joint pop.\n\nI had moved my big toe.\n\n... part 2, coming soon (?)", "edited": 1429758233.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I took this one pretty personally.
