I&amp;#39;ve never touched Aranessa and while I did try Khalida I got bored 10 turns in and abandoned that one. Some campaign simply aren&amp;#39;t unique enough to warrant a play throught when i have limited time to spend across many game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its a shame we didn&amp;#39;t get Shar&amp;#39;tor but apparently they do consider him AOS despite his history so there is little to be done there. Hopefully Tordrek Hackhart safely makes it into a VCoast DLC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11reemk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/totalwar/comments/11reemk/in_regards_to_the_new_3_ll_and_a_lh_policy/jcaplkg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/11reemk/in_regards_to_the_new_3_ll_and_a_lh_policy/", "name": "t1_jcaplkg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/totalwar", "author_flair_text": "Let the bell scream-scream!!", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678890518.0, "created_utc": 1678890518.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/11reemk"}}], "before": null}}
