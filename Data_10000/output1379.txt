He or she likely sees a lot of patients who also suffer from depression and may be aware of colleagues or other local mental health specialists (mhs) that have good reputations. Also, not sure about anxiety, but depression can be a sign of more strictly physical issues as well (poor sleep cycles, for example) so it's important for your GP to know. \n\nAs far as the actual finding of a good therapist, there are a few things to do. One thing to keep in mind as you carry out your search is that finding a mhs is a process. You have to find someone that is a good fit for you, which can take some experimenting. First, find out what mhs your insurance covers in a vicinity that you won't mind traveling. Then, start looking at reviews online (zocdoc can be a good resource for this). For me, I look for mhs that are described as being easy to get a hold of, punctual, have 45min-1hr long appointments, and specializes in both depression and couples counseling (I have a lot of anxiety about relationships so having someone that regularly deals with relationship issues is comforting for me).  Remember that this is matching process, so a mhs may be a good fit for you even if they weren't a good fit for someone else. Also, think about whether you're more comfortable with a psychiatrist (can prescribe medication) or a therapist (can't provide medication), as this can be a factor in the dynamic of your relationship. An antidepressant and talk therapy can be a dynamic duo of depression ass-kicking, but if you don't want medication, or would prefer for your gp to handle that, a therapist may be better suited to your needs. Finally, schedule yourself an appointment with someone (depending on the dr you may be able to do this online).  \n\nBefore your appointment, there are a few things that you can do to make the process a bit easier. If you're not already familiar with it, find out about your family's history of mental health problems. You may be asked to fill out a family history form. Think about whether you have specific goals for therapy  and make a list. Finally, let someone you trust know that you're starting therapy, and you might need their support in the future. Therapy can be hard work, and future you will have an easier time if you have someone that you know in advance is ready to play some video games or work out or eat chicken wings no questions asked if you've had a rough session and need a buddy. This is extra important if you might be starting any medications. Let someone that you talk to frequently that you're starting a new medicine, and to let you know if you're acting strangely over the next few weeks. Most antidepressants will take a few weeks to begin to kick in, and any sudden personality change (even exuberance) means that you need to talk to the dr who prescribed it to you immediately. \n\nFinally, on the day of, do everything you can to get yourself stoked for becoming a depression and anxiety slaying warrior. You're looking for your dojo. The first mhs that you see may not be your sansei, and that's totally fine. Use your first appointment to discuss your goals and find out what their style is. If you two are a match, great! If not, there is someone that will be better for you and you never have to talk to this person again. You're looking for someone that you feel able to trust, and that is ready to make a commitment to you. Take the mindset from the start that you will probably see several mhs on your quest for the right one and that's normal and fine. \n\nHopefully this is helpful. Sorry there isn't really a tldr. If you ever want to talk, feel free to pm me! Best of luck!\n\nEDIT: Thanks whomever gave me gold!
