You can have a very incompetent commander or a godly squaddie. Never forget that just having that crappy commander around in the skyranger will greatly reduce morale hits from casualties. Also bear in mind that ranks are assigned largely based on the total number of soldiers employed AND the total number of missions and kills a given soldier has.

It had almost nothing to do with the game itself and everything to do with my group's chemistry. See, as we got used to our powers we began to notice some our powers really synced up well together. For example, between my fighter's and the wizard's powers we found we could heavily control and hamper our foes, while our ranger and rogue could play cleanup at their leisure. These relationships showed up in our RP eventually, as these characters would end up getting along really well together outside of combat as well.\n\nI still remember my favorite session of that game. There was no \"combat\" per se, but our group happened upon a town during a festival with tons of games and contests going on. The first day was sort of a harvest festival and the second day was sort of a winter festival. During the harvest festival my fighter participated in and barely won the arena greco-roman wrestling match (basically forced to go with unarmed strikes only and had to use lots of exalted style stunting to actually fight well) and went through a couple of skill challenges to win the eating and drinking contests. I recall an archery contest that played out similar to the arena for our ranger. The next day, after the first snow settled in there was a town wide snowball fight that played out almost exactly like a standard encounter with a two-hit elimination rule, anything goes. Our wizard eventually won with creative use of his teleportation powers, but the rogue gave him a good run for his money with her stealth. I managed to defeat the ranger by meleeing him with snowballs, but drew everyone's attention after that. There was a sled race afterwards where we paired up into teams of two and used our powers to hamper the other teams. My fighter would opportunity attack and slow the opposing sleds with his powers using a wooden sword when they would try to pass us while my wizard buddy would use his powers to freeze the other sleds and eventually use his Thunderclap power as a sort of nitro boost for us to eke out a win. All of these events were basically skill challenges and combat encounters with loot and everything. The only difference was the window dressing.\n\nI guess, **tl;dr**:\n\n1. Use good \"window dressing\". Encounters can be many, many things for a creative DM. Also never forget, talking is a free action for both the players AND their opponents.\n\n2. Play to the party's synergies. Let character relationships develop from their power synergies as well as their backgrounds. I recommend using power cards to help cut down on looking up power effects if that's an issue.

Really sped combat up having almost all of your options right there in your hand, ready to go. Just had to get used to how they worked after that.\n3. Don't be afraid to reward the player for \"stunting\".  I would say \"stunting\" in a rules heavy system is best expressed as [Player action/ability + Outside factor (environment or other player's action/ability or enemy ability) = unique effect] Don't give them anything for stuff like \"I attack it's legs to knock it down!\". After all, that's solely dependent on the players already defined abilities. Why should this time be any different than all the other times? On the other hand, \"I time my knock back power to try and make him stumble over that chair/barrel/table/etc.\" is a bit different, wouldn't you say? We've got an established ability and an outside factor working to create a new effect. Remember to populate the environment with all kinds of objects like that and also to have their foes use the environment against them from time to time as well. Monkey see, monkey do is more true than you might think. The downside with this idea is that it places a lot of descriptive responsibility on the DM, as players will never interact with things they aren't aware of or don't think will work from the beginning.\n\nWhile it sounds like you won't continue using 4E, I hope my post can at least serve as inspiration with whatever you decide to do.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, D&amp;amp;D in general isn&amp;#39;t a system that encourages role playing at all as many have already stated.
