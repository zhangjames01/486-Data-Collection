I loved playing as the trapper, still do but he just needs some TLC from the devs. We eventually switched to other games and I forgot about DBD. \n\nThen with the hype of the nemesis chapter, even though I never really played resident evil, I wanted to see the changes that\u2019s happened over the years.\n\nAll the new killers, survivors, maps, skins, I figured alright let\u2019s hop back in. Bought a few killers during a steam sale this year and I was off. \n\nStarted out with the doctor. I found a survivor and zapped him, the sound, the visual, his laughter, instantly became my main. I loved the static blast finding everybody around me. Couple that with the reward you could get for prediction, good vision and good listening, and the doc\u2019s kit gave so much info on where they were to bump up anything you were slacking on. Really good middle of the line killer in terms of power, IMO. \n\nThen I gave a few more killers a try; Myers (jump scaring is so fun), GF (I suck with him), Freddy (also suck), Spirit (fun to play and I love the design/aesthetic of the ghost zombie style),  and then Pyramid Head (love him, but I suck). \n\nThen my last two I tried: Huntress and Gunslinger. I love them both. Gunslingers chuckling, his design (love that long coat), he\u2019s great. Huntress love the Lullaby, (and the song it\u2019s based on too!) the jank hits that somehow connect with the axes, shes just fun to play.\n\nThen I had a day where I had 3 dailies for survivor even after clearing. Fiiiiine I\u2019ll play survivor. Chose David for his design, and honestly, I had a lot of fun. Sure I died a lot and realized playing surv can be just as hard or easy as killer; I\u2019ve stuck with David since then. What really sold me for survivor was the sounds you hear when you aren\u2019t a killer; going up against a doctor and *hearing the distant electrical pulses, holy shit.* or the gunslingers gunshots, oni\u2019s roaring, faint chainsaw noises *RAPIDLY APPROACHING*, I freaking love the sound design. Hearing it as a killer vs being hunted, so good. You feel powerful as a killer and you get worried hearing them as a survivor. The terror radius of the clown was great too and chase songs. So good. \n\nNow I\u2019ve got a little over 100 hrs (I know, rookie numbers), and between surv and killer I\u2019m right around 8-10 rank, staying pretty even. I\u2019ve gotten better at hiding/looping, and better at finding/anti-looping. \n\nThat said, wraith, cannibal, and pig seem to all have my number because I suck surviving against them. \n\nI do think the community can be bad at times. The subreddit here is always posting hackers, but I\u2019ve played a fair number of matches on both sides and have yet to encounter a hacker. Granted, I\u2019m not in super high ranks. \n\nCampers/trolls? Yeah sure I\u2019ve seen them, any game has them really. Been gaming for 24+ years and I\u2019ve learned to live with it when you play online. \n\n I\u2019m on PC, and I do agree that console needs to be fixed.\n\nFinal opinion of the game? I love it. There\u2019s so much detail (despite the generators still looking dated graphic wise), and also there\u2019s so much potential with new killers/survivors and what they still can do or add to the game, I\u2019m looking forward to it all. \n\nI just bought some skins for David with my iridescent shards.
