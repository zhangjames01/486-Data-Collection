So, actually, the whole thing makes a lot more sense in that context. In any case, time for my wall of text because I'm getting everything off my chest. Shooting my load, if you will.\n\nThe fact that there is such animosity between nations in East Asia is not just Japan's fault. Nor is it just other nations'. It's partly a misfortune of circumstance. Nation's aren't people, and you can't think of them that way. And so moving on from war is a very organic process which comes in fits and starts and pulls and pushes, and this process was seriously screwed up in Asia for the reasons I mentioned in earlier posts. If China and Korea were democratic countries after 1945, they probably would have put more leverage on Japan sooner after the war about the ways it wasn't living up to its responsibility. But they weren't. The governments didn't really care because they had other priorities or didn't care at all, and the people's thoughts in China and Korea weren't going to be reflected at an international level because of the anti-democratic nature of their governments. Plus the political division meant that these countries weren't really linked together all. There wasn't a lot of exchange. That's one of the reasons why most of these historiographical conflicts exploded in the 90s and not far earlier, and with such ridiculous passion (and sometimes violence).\n\n&gt; they have defended the fact that oh boy, alot of Koreans, and people in general, wont like this for justifiable reasons.\n\n**The only point I ever really wanted to make** was that I think these justifiable reasons are less justifiable than people would like to admit. East Asia has a history problem but its *not just Japan's problem*. By which I mean, it's not just a problem Japan has to deal with. Yeah, it makes a lot sense. I totally understand. Getting your country fucked up that bad, I get it. But after a certain point, its just a grudge. But it's not a harmless grudge. It not something that exists in isolation. It's like an international feedback loop of retardation. Japan needs to put pressure on its domestic right-wing faction to go the fuck away, yes. If that happened, Japanese politicans wouldn't have to worry about appearing weak or unpatriotic to its conservative vote and the pandering would go away and a lot of issues would probably resolve themselves. And people living in Korea, for example, need to figure out who they're really mad at, what they're really mad about, and why they're actually still mad about it! Koreans need to figure out why they make people nervous about drawing a picture of a guy whos been dead for 400 years. Don't they want people to not worry about that?! 400 years! That's like 13 generations! That's a really fucking long time ago! And I think saying that they're angry because of its connections to imperial Japan is a cop-out. It's *easier* to say that. It sort of makes sense, right? Invading Korea, yadda yadda... But that's what makes it \"easy\". Because it's not the same thing. And saying that two events separated by 300 years of history, involving two completely different Japans and Koreas and completely different people is both horribly ignorant of history, but it appeals to an emotional response that is entirely irrational, sometimes dangerous, and **completely unproductive**. If you keep thinking that way, you're only going to have the same shit problems you've always had!\n\nIf this was 1950, yeah, you could say that Japan needs to \"own up\". You could put it completely on them. But all those people responsible? They're dead now. The Japan of today has done jack shit. You can't treat them like the same thing. Japan still has responsibilities- being respectful, not whitewashing history, all that good stuff. But they're not the same thing. Why should I feel bad for the slaves my great-great-great grandfather kept? Why should a Japanese kid feel the same way? I would expect him to feel empathetic. To have a sense of tragedy and regret that it ever occurred. Do I feel the need to apologize to the Japanese for the atomic bombs? No. Do I regret that it happened? Yes. Time passes. Life goes on. It is entirely unreasonably to expect people today to feel as connected to and responsible for shit that happened 3 or 4 generations before they were born! It's just unrealistic!\n\nNationalism is dangerous and it exists everywhere in East Asia because it feeds into itself. It doesn't make the nut-jobs in other countries less crazy.. it sort of does the opposite, and vice versa. I mean, killing pheasants in front of an embassy over some unlivable piece of shit rock in the ocean? Because the Japanese government puts out the same press release they do every year saying that Takeshima is part of Japan? Like every country does in the region for all of their silly territorial disputes? For what? *Maybe* some oil and fishing rights? What the fuck should the average Korean care about that? The answer is they don't. Instead Japan exists as like some kind of boogeyman or political scapegoat slot machine. It should be a complete non-issue. Who gives a shit, they control it! But instead, you have Korean groups putting up billboards in New Jersey and Texas of all places saying \"Dokdo is Korea!\" And the world echoes back... \"We don't give a shit!\" and \"What the fuck is a dokdo?\" Saying that its reasonable for Koreans to be so upset over these issues is a cop out. It embraces ignorance. Lets take Dokdo for example. Koreans use Dokdo as a nationalist icon and they see Japanese claims to the rocks as echoes of its militarist, expansionist past. Which, I mean, sounds very appealing doesn't it? The Japanese dogs are coming again to take our land! Not this time! Right? It's very emotional! But it's also dishonest. Most people in Japan don't give a shit, and the only reason Japan still makes those claims because it has to if it wants to keep its other territorial claims legitimate (Northern Territories, Senkaku, etc...). Why do you think China will never give up hope of assimilating \"Taiwan\"? Because a) the CCCP has banked its legitimacy on the image that it's the protector of unified China that expelled the last foreign invaders and letting Taiwan go would be felt as a huge failure by its nationalistic populace and b) giving up Taiwan (despite the fact that it is by de facto its own nation) would give legitimacy to other separatist movements (Tibet, Xinjiang).\n\n**Teaching people to see things for what they are is not being insensitive (although that depends on how you go about it)**. And while its not necessarily for others to tell people to \"move on\" its not stupid to call people out for the irrationality of their behavior.\n\nJapan's got its fair share of right-wing idiots, but these right wing idiots are also very often denounced and criticized. It's not like the crap they pull is *uncontroversial*. Letting people *in every country* persist in their ignorant, simplified conceptions of complicated issues like textbooks and Yasukuni shrine visits only makes the problem worse. People shouldn't be defending their right to hate others just because its convenient or 'feels right'.\n\n**tl;dr Hate less mah niggas!**\n\nFake Edit: Oops I think I pulled an Orb!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, and I didn&amp;#39;t realize this, but someone linked elsewhere that &amp;quot;Naniwa&amp;quot; was a historical name for one of Japan&amp;#39;s capitals when it was in Osaka.
