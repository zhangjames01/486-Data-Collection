My (adult) cats are fed twice a day and poo twice a day, and at about the same times each day, too. But otherwise you can&amp;#39;t make her poo when you want her too, she&amp;#39;s going to go when she feels the need to go - same as you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cats are not good about learning the word NO. Hah, yeah, you&amp;#39;re expecting too much there. For some things you can use a squirt bottle, but understand that your kitty will most likely learn simply to not do things when you&amp;#39;re there as opposed to not doing them at all. As in, counter + owner = water spray, counter + no owner = safe and fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also ended up spending hundreds in vet bills the first few weeks I had my kitties, not to mention adoption fees and supplies. And then they tried to tear up the furniture. But I got two so they could play together and avoided some trouble there.  That said, cats come with different personalities and you seem to have an adventurous one. If you can work with that and connect with her, she will be a blast to have around, confident and fun and full of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1lnsnu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Pets/comments/1lnsnu/does_it_get_better_my_kitten_has_drained_all_the/cc12r2w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1lnsnu/does_it_get_better_my_kitten_has_drained_all_the/", "name": "t1_cc12r2w", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Pets", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1378239471.0, "created_utc": 1378239471.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1lnsnu/does_it_get_better_my_kitten_has_drained_all_the/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2p", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I have never been more proud of my sister.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 12, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "atheism", "link_author": "Thatkidyouknow", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cc0fitk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "pick_a_name", "num_comments": 207, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cc0fbwy", "score": 12, "author_fullname": "t2_ccm3x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; For your sister to allegedly turn around and mock her beliefs is just rude and entirely disrespectful.\n\nI don't see this as mocking.
