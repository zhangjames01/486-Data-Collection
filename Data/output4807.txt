Being a nurse, the homeowner comes in and turns me to my side so my airway can open back up. After he gets me under control, him and a few of our other friends clean up the mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wake up the next morning to everyone in the living room except for my now ex who ditched me. Home owner tells me his wife is still asleep but that I ruined her wedding dress and I need to find a way to fix it our pay for a new one. Still drunk me starts sobbing uncontrollably. At this time homeowners wife comes through the front door with zaxbys and asks what&amp;#39;s going on. I tell get everything and swear to her that I&amp;#39;ll make it right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was at this time that everyone decides I&amp;#39;ve had enough torture. Homeowner and his wife tell me I did not throw up in the dress, only on the storage box which was sealed and that there was no damage to anything.  I deserved every bit of that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr I got dangerously drunk at a friend&amp;#39;s, almost ruined his wife&amp;#39;s wedding dress and was fucked with heavily to pay for my stupidity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3ibku6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/3ibku6/whats_the_craziest_black_out_drunk_experience/cuf057c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ibku6/whats_the_craziest_black_out_drunk_experience/", "name": "t1_cuf057c", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1440507580.0, "created_utc": 1440507580.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ibku6/whats_the_craziest_black_out_drunk_experience/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What are you afraid of?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "coz8req", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "ragermeister30", "num_comments": 251, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_2xdbw0", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_97ik4", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Little people.
