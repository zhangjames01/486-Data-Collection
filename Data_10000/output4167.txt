Or you leverage parents who aren&amp;#39;t going to charge rent, there&amp;#39;s ways to achieve the 25% but realistically without a ton of sacrifice, you&amp;#39;ll probably be a lot like me.  Monthly mortgage + escrow comes out to 45% of my income.  It&amp;#39;s not ideal to be in this range long term but it&amp;#39;s temporary for me.  Granted my house is also rising in value so there&amp;#39;s equity being made (as well as higher taxes) but I don&amp;#39;t realize those gains until I sell so i&amp;#39;m not counting that.I can sustain this because my mortgage is my only debt.  Car is paid off with low mileage and I work from home so it&amp;#39;s pretty ideal for me.  I put as much as I reasonably can into a Roth IRA(I can&amp;#39;t max it but at least it&amp;#39;s something) every paycheck and company match my 401k so i&amp;#39;m working towards retirement.  I then build a savings on top of all of that to cover at least 6 months worth of expenses.  It&amp;#39;s not easy, you always feel like you need to make more money to make it work but it&amp;#39;s doable (I make 65k/year before taxes as a single home owner).  Any extra money left over gets invested in stocks.  Since i&amp;#39;m still building my emergency fund, I don&amp;#39;t invest in stocks at the moment.  I also have pretty inexpensive hobbies that I invested in early in life like musical instruments(I have an electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and piano), free to play PC titles, etc.  I still have a large library of games and can reasonably shell out some money if I want to but as long as you&amp;#39;re being reasonable with your spending, you can still enjoy things, just budget it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_vrho1g", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/vrho1g/what_of_your_salary_should_you_spend_on_rent/ieyvczu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/vrho1g/what_of_your_salary_should_you_spend_on_rent/", "name": "t1_ieyvczu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Frugal", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1657042904.0, "created_utc": 1657042904.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/vrho1g/what_of_your_salary_should_you_spend_on_rent/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s1h9", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Weekly Check in - How are you doing?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Epilepsy", "link_author": "halfkender", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iees7yh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dooyoufondue", "num_comments": 27, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vlq8vu", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_djsyg", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "i'm Not epileptic but a family member of mine that is has had 20+ seizures today.
