I have heard \"20 people\", \"50 people\", \"500 people\" and even \"it depends\". Any sort of universal size limit for a voluntary corporation is arbitrary and subjective. There is no such thing as an objective point at which a corporation becomes \"too big\". It is absurd to say that a corporation of 50 people should become illegal as soon as it gains one more person. It is equally absurd to forbid two people from joining; and likewise up to infinity. It is a non-violent, voluntary association of individuals. To advocate an enforced limit on the number of individuals in a corporation is to advocate the initiation of violence on non-violent people. \n\nThe free market can regulate the size of corporations without the need for arbitrary standards or limits. This is done through the profit mechanism. In general, one organization can only efficiently do so much. If the corporation wants to reap profits, the maximum size of the corporation is the size that allows it to create the most value for the consumers. Any size that hinders its ability to create value will result in a loss of profits, and if the size hinders its ability enough, it will result in losses. The corporation experiencing losses will then need to downsize. \n\ntl;dr: All enforced limits of corporation size must be arbitrary.

Any sort of universal size limit for a voluntary corporation is arbitrary and subjective. There is no such thing as an objective point at which a corporation becomes &amp;quot;too big&amp;quot;. It is absurd to say that a corporation of 50 people should become illegal as soon as it gains one more person. It is equally absurd to forbid two people from joining; and likewise up to infinity. It is a non-violent, voluntary association of individuals. To advocate an enforced limit on the number of individuals in a corporation is to advocate the initiation of violence on non-violent people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The free market can regulate the size of corporations without the need for arbitrary standards or limits. This is done through the profit mechanism. In general, one organization can only efficiently do so much. If the corporation wants to reap profits, the maximum size of the corporation is the size that allows it to create the most value for the consumers. Any size that hinders its ability to create value will result in a loss of profits, and if the size hinders its ability enough, it will result in losses.
