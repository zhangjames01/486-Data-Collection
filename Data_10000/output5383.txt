Unlike termites,  the population does not resolve around a queen and functions more familiar to a more human-like society, a balance of male and female, but all acting as a collective with \"towns\" reaching most edges of their domain. Each \"town\" has a small native caste of larger Gliesians, which could be seen as lords of their domains but with no king to answer to and using messengers to extend agreements to band together to attack neighboring lands.\n\nPerhaps also disappointingly, they are akin to humans in the same way of still being a society dependent on slavery. There are also dispersed groups of more humanoid species with \"true opposable thumbs\" (See reports: Nomadic, Small Societal, and Continent Beta sentient societies) but almost all of the humanoids in the Gliesian Empire have been taken as slaves. These humanoids form the \"disposables\" of Gliesian society for things such as labor, fine motor skill dependent jobs, and cannon fodder for war.\n\nThe Gliesian empire Actively wage war on the far smaller opposing societies that form their neighbors. Diplomacy is near non-existent as Gliesians have very rudimentary methods of producing sounds that successfully convey little more than mood, pheramones and limb movements are the preferred methods of communicating to other Gliesians. Writing is the most effective method for non-Gliesians to communicate but the poor focus on any education in the Gliesian empire means very little chance for success. The main reason for waging war is additional lands and capturing slaves. The advances of metal production in comparison to other societies and sheer number of troops give Gliesians an edge in warefare.\n\nMetal working of the society is still in the early stages as the insect-like population appear to be poikilotherms. Due to being dependent on the ambient temperature for regulating body heat, attending smelters and forges fall upon the slaves to produce all of their metal production. This dependency on ambient temperature ensure the empire is less active and sluggish in winter and active but less violent in summer for risk of heat stroke. Gliesian building  have self-temperature regulating structure to keep the inside around a comfortable 31 **\u00b0C**  year round.

Unlike termites,  the population does not resolve around a queen and functions more familiar to a more human-like society, a balance of male and female, but all acting as a collective with &amp;quot;towns&amp;quot; reaching most edges of their domain. Each &amp;quot;town&amp;quot; has a small native caste of larger Gliesians, which could be seen as lords of their domains but with no king to answer to and using messengers to extend agreements to band together to attack neighboring lands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps also disappointingly, they are akin to humans in the same way of still being a society dependent on slavery. There are also dispersed groups of more humanoid species with &amp;quot;true opposable thumbs&amp;quot; (See reports: Nomadic, Small Societal, and Continent Beta sentient societies) but almost all of the humanoids in the Gliesian Empire have been taken as slaves. These humanoids form the &amp;quot;disposables&amp;quot; of Gliesian society for things such as labor, fine motor skill dependent jobs, and cannon fodder for war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Gliesian empire Actively wage war on the far smaller opposing societies that form their neighbors. Diplomacy is near non-existent as Gliesians have very rudimentary methods of producing sounds that successfully convey little more than mood, pheramones and limb movements are the preferred methods of communicating to other Gliesians. Writing is the most effective method for non-Gliesians to communicate but the poor focus on any education in the Gliesian empire means very little chance for success. The main reason for waging war is additional lands and capturing slaves. The advances of metal production in comparison to other societies and sheer number of troops give Gliesians an edge in warefare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Metal working of the society is still in the early stages as the insect-like population appear to be poikilotherms. Due to being dependent on the ambient temperature for regulating body heat, attending smelters and forges fall upon the slaves to produce all of their metal production. This dependency on ambient temperature ensure the empire is less active and sluggish in winter and active but less violent in summer for risk of heat stroke.
