I can&amp;#39;t speak to other states&amp;#39; counties, but in New York, the more &amp;quot;urban&amp;quot; areas voted Obama.  \nMaybe a bunch of white people voted *against* Obama because he&amp;#39;s black, but that&amp;#39;s something altogether different.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_134rcj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/134rcj/paul_ryan_obama_won_because_so_many_urban_voters/c70xsha/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/134rcj/paul_ryan_obama_won_because_so_many_urban_voters/", "name": "t1_c70xsha", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1352847875.0, "created_utc": 1352847875.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/11/13/paul-ryan-obama-won-because-of-urban-turnout/#.UKJv82guhQo.reddit"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r74k", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Introversion and sexual experience/preference/orientation [NSFW]", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "introverts", "link_author": "stimpakk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c6y4sz8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jchav38685", "num_comments": 53, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_12thkk", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_8wy3f", "over_18": true, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "**1) What is your gender?**  \nMale  \n**2) What is your age?**  \n30  \n**3) What is your sexual orientation?
