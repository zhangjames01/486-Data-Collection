Lebron has the advantage, but when Scottie and Bird got hot they could shoot the lights out.\n\nAt the 4 its Barkley or Malone vs. Anthony Davis. Davis is the best player in the NBA right now and an absolute freak of nature. As much as I don't care for him, there has never really been a player in the league with his particular skill set.\n\nAt 5 its its Ewing or David Robinson vs. Dwight Howard probably.\n\nAll in all, if you are looking at it overall, I think that there is one thing that sets apart the '92 team and that is attitude.

I&amp;#39;ve never been so embarrassed looking back at drunk texts in my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here, I&amp;#39;d spent all this time, not exactly being a person I wasn&amp;#39;t, but trying to be the best person I&amp;#39;m capable of being. She was so amazing, even the best version of me wasn&amp;#39;t close to good enough. Then in one night that I don&amp;#39;t even remember that all crumbled away, but that isn&amp;#39;t even the worst part...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to apologize the next day, it was pretty well thought out and sincere. Little did I know that her and her boyfriend were having problems and he must have been a controlling asshole because he got onto her facebook and saw the message I sent. Apparently it was the last straw. He thought that we were together behind his back I guess. So they broke up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR I have a drinking problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1mswsr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1mswsr/whats_something_you_didused_to_do_that_makes_you/cccc9yk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mswsr/whats_something_you_didused_to_do_that_makes_you/", "name": "t1_cccc9yk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1379716513.0, "created_utc": 1379716513.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mswsr/whats_something_you_didused_to_do_that_makes_you/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What is one of your most memorable times when you were out drinking or experimenting with other substances?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "flying_bacon", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cccb6t4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ares688", "num_comments": 5, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1mswbs", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_81uyb", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think on some level the best ones are the ones that are only vaguely memorable.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think on some level the best ones are the ones that are only vaguely memorable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1mswbs", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1mswbs/what_is_one_of_your_most_memorable_times_when_you/cccb6t4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mswbs/what_is_one_of_your_most_memorable_times_when_you/", "name": "t1_cccb6t4", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1379712945.0, "created_utc": 1379712945.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mswbs/what_is_one_of_your_most_memorable_times_when_you/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What has been your proudest moment thus far?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "traheidda", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cccaxuf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ares688", "num_comments": 2, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1msve6", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_81uyb", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Getting an article published about dealing with depression 3 weeks after trying to kill myself.
