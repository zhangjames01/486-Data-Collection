If it&amp;#39;s the former, yes that&amp;#39;s snapback; you&amp;#39;re basically performing a tilt in the wrong direction due to snapback and then cancelling it with a jump which produces Nair since you are holding the A button longer than the directional input was being held. You can potentially work around this by forcing yourself to hit the jump button before you hit the A button, and not at the same time, but I can&amp;#39;t say for sure without seeing it happen. If it&amp;#39;s the latter of the two, you&amp;#39;re stick box is worn and drifting, but this would only be the case if it only occurs when facing one direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_bqyixb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CrazyHand/comments/bqyixb/where_to_find_a_dedicated_controller/eogcipo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/bqyixb/where_to_find_a_dedicated_controller/", "name": "t1_eogcipo", "author_flair_template_id": "0ace16ae-5671-11e9-ac1e-0ec2a3963ea2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CrazyHand", "author_flair_text": "He She Me We Wumbo", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1558555179.0, "created_utc": 1558555179.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyHand/comments/bqyixb/where_to_find_a_dedicated_controller/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33vle", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Where to find a dedicated controller?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "CrazyHand", "link_author": "Browlon", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eo9pwgr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Delslayer", "num_comments": 17, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eo96c28", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_38rtd", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Pro controllers have the same snapback issues as gamecube controllers, more input delay, and they break down quicker.
