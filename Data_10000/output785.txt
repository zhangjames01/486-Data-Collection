The girl three chairs behind me is my boss, but she's new and we mainly talk about random shit.  In fact, this week I find out I'm reporting to someone else starting next week. Whatever.\n\nGo online and open Google Docs where I write down all the stuff I want to do that day. I actually could decide to do nothing, but that's more boring than work.  I add a few items.  I think yesterdays items looked something like this: \"Figure out where to sit,\" \"Talk to our new CEO,\" \"build relationship with Steve ahead of project,\" \"figure out what causes our company's metric to be bad,\" \"put together presentation on last analysis I did.\"  That's basically a day's work.\n\nI then open Pandora and listen to music the rest of the day.  I do about half my work at my desk, and half my work on a couch.  My office has free everything - coffee, soda, chips, candy bars - and I drink / eat these often.  Thinking about where to sit is important because I have a new boss and I want to make sure I integrate myself in the team.  There's real thinking there, which is tiring, so I do that on the couch.  Next up, analysis.  I fire up excel and start pounding out a model.  I'm good at excel from my years of working in finance.  I'm genuinely curious to see the result.  1 hour later I have it - pretty mediocre correlation - nothing worth presenting. Bummer.\n\nIt's now 11:30 and I can smell the lunch in our company's kitchen.  I wonder what we're eating today.  I figure it's a good time to catch-up on some email and check gmail.  Nothing important so I go back to my to-do list.  I'm going to spend the next 15 minutes thinking about where I'll sit. The front is where all the engineers sit but I'm not one of them.  Hrm, let's move closer to them.  I put in my request to HR - I should hear back in a week.\n\nIt's now 12 and I go to the kitchen.  We ordered for a local restaurant - our favorite actually.  We all sit down and eat together.\n\nIt's now 12:30 and I forgot I have a meeting at 1pm to talk about our company's new initiative that my friend is leading on a new product we are launching.  I'm not leading it, so I'll help out but not much else.\n\nIt's now 1:30 and I go back to my desk and check my to-do list. Oh yea, \"Build relationship with Steve.\"  I email Steve from engineering and say we should grab coffee soon. He emails back \"Sounds Good!\" and I schedule a time tomorrow for us to meet up.  \n\nAt this point, I have my weekly meeting with one of my two direct reports. I start off by asking him how things are going with the sales new vendor search and how's he's feeling.  He then updates me for the next few minutes.  Then I bring up a new project for him to focus on this week and what we want to learn.  He agrees and we part ways. It's now 3pm.\n\nTime to pound out some real thinking. I position myself on the couch and work for 1.5 hours on tomorrow's presentation to the senior management about how we could save the company money by better leveraging our infrastructure.  It's a 15 page slide deck but I think it's convincing.  Satisfied - I fire up Google and check a few of the stocks I own.  No major change.  Ok - let's read reddit for 15 minutes.\n\nOk it's now 4:45 and things are winding down.  I look at my to-do list, \"Figure out why company metric is bad\" remains. It's too late to crank this out. It'll require too much thinking.  I check my email again and respond to things that have come in over the past week that I have starred in gmail.  It's now 5:15.  \n\n\"Bye everyone\" I say.  A bunch of people say bye and I go home. I make mid-six-figures for this job.
