I mentioned harpoons, which let you quickly place loot onto your boat from a distance. There&amp;#39;s crates which let you store and move large amount of supplies easily. There&amp;#39;s a PvP queue mode where you can invade other servers and battle in the adventure map, and they&amp;#39;ve added more world events and random PvE encounters on the seas.

Here's a few words of warning from my perspective:\n\nOne thing is that the game is a bit more sandbox-y than I initially thought. While completing voyages and events are all well and good, you very quickly reach a point where you're just adding numbers to more numbers. At the end of the day the only progression provided is you earn rep + complete commendations to unlock cosmetics and earn gold to buy those cosmetics.\n\nYou have to be prepared to lose EVERYTHING you've worked for in a session, because it will happen. It's an unavoidable fact that you can be sunk by another player mere moments away from turning in your treasure and you won't get anything for all your trouble. Of course, you can do the same to others, which means the game can be very swingy in rewards. Sometimes you walk away with nothing, other times you walk away with the treasure of multiple ships.\n\nFinally, I think the game is MUCH more enjoyable with other players. There is an option to crew with random players, and consider looking for communities via Discord to help you find people to play with! You can be effective when you play alone (referred to as \"solo slooping\") but it can be very punishing and it's very possible to be bullied by sheer numbers. This takes a different playstyle and mentality - plays like tucking (hiding on other ships) or alliances become much more necessary to avoid getting run down by a brig or galleon. This becomes easier the better you get at the game!\n\nSo, with those words of warning, I'd summarize it by saying that you should make sure you love the gameplay before purchasing! At the end of the day, there really isn't much to work for, but the feeling of sailing the seas, fighting bosses, krakens, megalodons, and going on all sorts of epic adventures was definitely worth the price for me. The game is gorgeous, the amount of content is quite high, and they're still doing regular *free* updates that add even more to the game. And that's not to mention the endless possibilities that happen when sharing the seas with other players.
