Criterion: the condition that must be fulfilled in order to achieve a given value. On to the analogy:\n\nSuppose that your circle of friends loves tea, and you like to invite them over to your home for tea parties. Your \"society\" values tea. Now, you might be able to brew the best damn coffee in existence, but that doesn't do anything for your group because, while some people might like coffee, you want to have a tea party.

If the topic is resolved: minors charged with violent crimes ought to be tried as adults, values like justice, mercy and security all have a place in the conversation; on the other hand, values like transparency, knowledge and aesthetic expression aren't particularly relevant.\n\nBut lets say that you and your friends change your minds, and you want to have a coffee party instead. Coffee is accepted as the legitimate value. Now your job is to fulfill the conditions necessary to make as much delicious coffee as possible. In order to do that, you need the raw coffee grounds (arguments/contentions), and a way to filter them into the refined end product. The criterion acts as  your coffee filter. Returning to our resolution above, lets say that we picked the value \"justice\". If I'm the negative, my goal is to demonstrate the trying minors charged with committing violent crimes is ultimately against the interest of justice. To do this, I might argue that minors lack the full capacity to be culpable for their actions; the problem is that there isn't a clear link between this argument and the value of justice *prima facie*. So, it becomes necessary to explicit demonstrate why the argument for negating the resolution leads to the maximization of justice. Enter the coffee filter. What conditions do the arguments have to fulfill in order to demonstrate that they achieve (and maximize) the value of justice? As the negative, I might suggest that preventing unnecessary harm is a necessary criterion of achieving justice. If justice is defined as \"giving each their due\", and harm is not deemed necessary, then that harm is not due; therefore, unnecessary harm is unjust. I can then proceed to reason that trying someone as an adult who doesn't have a sufficient degree of culpability creates unnecessary harm because it results in severe punishment for those who cannot fully comprehend the enormity of their actions, diminishing the value of retributive justice. That's delicious coffee; that gets through the filter. But what about the argument that more trying minors as adults will add to the number of long term inmates, increasing state reliance on private prisons? One might argue that this causes unnecessary harm because it erodes the state's role in law enforcement and exacerbates the moral hazard inherent within the industry, but the connection is weak, and would better be suited to a value of governmental legitimacy (or the like). The filter strains this argument out.\n\nIt's important to stress to novices that the value and criterion are not arguments in and of themselves; they are merely a way for the judge to decide who has better arguments. The corollary to this is that *it doesn't matter who established the value and criteria*, only that the debater demonstrates that their case better satisfy them.

It's an opportunity to enrich yourself, to learn and grow, and to become a better person. Never again will you have an opportunity to be around so many wickedly intelligent people who have made it their life's mission to share their knowledge and experience with you, nor will there ever be a time when you are surrounded by so many people with similar interests and backgrounds.

Unless you&amp;#39;re heading to grad school, probably not a whole lot. Now, you DID mention that you would like to do research, which may lead you down that path; however, getting that credential when you are really just interested in nutrition is largely redundant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, you&amp;#39;ve got electives to fill, and the worst thing you could do is pick easy, irrelevant classes to fill them. Judging by your potential major selections, your not afraid of numbers; a minor in statistics would go a long way in getting you where you want to be career wise (specifically the part about research). There are other benefits to taking a minor instead of a second major too. Every choice you make has opportunity cost; instead of spending all your time on coursework, a minor may give you the necessary time to pursue an internship in your desired field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it&amp;#39;s your decision. From a career perspective, these are some of the key points that I would be considering if I were in your shoes. I will leave you with one last thing to consider: there&amp;#39;s more to the college experience than simply acquiring the skills to land a job. Too many of my peers see education only as a means to an end, and as a result, have lost four years of their lives doing something that they merely tolerated, only to go on and begin tolerating the rest of their lives. I&amp;#39;m not saying you should follow your passion blindly into a sinkhole of debt and unemployment; rather, just remember that an education&amp;#39;s value extends far beyond the money it helps you make. It&amp;#39;s an opportunity to enrich yourself, to learn and grow, and to become a better person. Never again will you have an opportunity to be around so many wickedly intelligent people who have made it their life&amp;#39;s mission to share their knowledge and experience with you, nor will there ever be a time when you are surrounded by so many people with similar interests and backgrounds. Take advantage of this. Don&amp;#39;t tolerate the rest of your life. Remember that money is merely a (necessary) tool, and not the end game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3zoali", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/3zoali/what_would_look_best_for_a_job_college_major/cynrhwq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3zoali/what_would_look_best_for_a_job_college_major/", "name": "t1_cynrhwq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/jobs", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1452059917.0, "created_utc": 1452059917.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3zoali/what_would_look_best_for_a_job_college_major/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfmf", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "If Trump manages to win it all, what does a Trump presidential term look like?
