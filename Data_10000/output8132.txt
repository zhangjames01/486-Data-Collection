Here&amp;#39;s the thing, it would be one thing if the only option or avenue they had was to garner ratings through such exploitation of women.  But, as NXT has shown, there is a crop of female athletes out there that can perform and engage crowds based on facets that any person could aspire to - hard work, fighting for what&amp;#39;s right, may the best person win the title.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, when wrestling fans see an alternative, viable route of garnering mainstream attention that they are proud to be associated with (the women of NXT and the 4 star matches they are capable of), vs. check this girl out, she&amp;#39;s hot - THAT&amp;#39;S a big reason why there is so much hatred.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3k664i", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3k664i/total_divas_just_made_the_best_case_yet_for_why/cuvku7q/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3k664i/total_divas_just_made_the_best_case_yet_for_why/", "name": "t1_cuvku7q", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SquaredCircle", "author_flair_text": "look at my adjective", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1441807367.0, "created_utc": 1441807367.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3k664i/total_divas_just_made_the_best_case_yet_for_why/"}}], "before": null}}
