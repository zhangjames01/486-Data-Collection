I really wish they'd update these forms for the post-Mike Harris era.)\n2. Catholic schools (which comprise about 35-40% of the publicly funded schools in Ontario) are legally permitted to hire only Catholics.

Catholic elementary schools are legally permitted to turn away non-Catholic kids.  If you know of a non-Catholic student in a Catholic elementary school it's because funding is allocated on a per-pupil basis and allowing a non-Catholic in is preferred over an empty seat and a \\~$14,000 loss.\n4. Catholic secondary schools are *not* permitted to turn away non-Catholic kids.
