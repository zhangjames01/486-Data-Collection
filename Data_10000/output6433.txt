But when faced with the choice of your perfect school and LDR vs. a second-choice school and being with your SO... I would pick the latter.  :)  And even if you&amp;#39;re still struggling with the decision, send out the applications anyway!!! Open more doors than you need to, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If he&amp;#39;s expressed wanting you to be closer, tell him you&amp;#39;d like to transfer schools to be with him.  The subject of moving in together should come naturally from that while discussing schools and logistics.  Would you be willing to live in your own place near him if he&amp;#39;s not ready to move in with you?  The only way to not be pushy or controlling is to actually NOT be pushy or controlling.  You can bring it up, but you have to be ready to let him lead the decision by being ready to get your own place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA:  Since he&amp;#39;s out of state, it may be a good idea for you to just move and live there for a while to establish residency.  That will get you in-state tuition if you go to a public university.  Meanwhile, take some classes at a community college and/or work, if you can find work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3qqwij", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3qqwij/give_me_your_advice_on_my_future_in_school/cwhoi49/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3qqwij/give_me_your_advice_on_my_future_in_school/", "name": "t1_cwhoi49", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RedPillWomen", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1446156122.0, "created_utc": 1446156122.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/3qqwij/give_me_your_advice_on_my_future_in_school/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xing", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "She stormed off", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "RedPillWomen", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cwhkpeg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TheLadyPainter", "num_comments": 8, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cwhk5he", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_csxxz", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes, it is.
