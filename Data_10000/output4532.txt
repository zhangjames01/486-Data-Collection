This is bollocks. His stance on Iraq was the same as his stance on the Bosnian genocide in the 1990s. He was a fervent supporter of the Palestinian cause. \n\nThe fact that his views on the removal of a genocidal dictator coincided with those of the Bush administration is, quite frankly, a relief. This does not mean that his motives were the same as those of the Bush administration. There are many theories that attempt to explain the invasion of Iraq. My personal favourite is Ahsan I Butt's performative war thesis, which proposes that the US invaded Iraq as a show of force more than anything else (and is in line with the canned Defense Planning Guidance drafted by Paul Wolfowitz and his cronies a decade earlier). There is nothing to indicate that Hitchens' support for the Iraq War was motivated by anything other than the desire to see the aforementioned genocidal dictator removed from power. \n\nYou seem to conflate what Hitchens believed with what the US government did in a way that is not only extremely misleading but also just... strange. Christopher Hitchens had nothing to do with US arms sales to Iraq during the 1980s, so I fail to understand how that is relevant to the point. I haven't said a word about what \"other Iraq War enthusiasts\" believed, but again, you're not reading what I'm writing. You're arguing against an argument that no one has made.\n\nI'll restate it one more time: Christopher Hitchens supported the Iraq War because it was a war against a genocidal dictator who repeatedly had committed crimes against humanity. This would be in line with just about everything he wrote throughout his life. This is something I personally support wholeheartedly, since I tend not to be a fan of genocidal dictators.\n\nAs to your final point, I will yet again point out that you're not reading what I'm writing.\n\nThere is a world where Saddam stays in power during the 2000s, and keeps systematically murdering anyone who opposes him while dabbling in a bit of light genocide against the Kurds on the side. In this world, there is no power vacuum for IS to exploit and Iraq remains a stable but tyrannical regime. This is the world you prefer.\n\nThere is also the world where Saddam is removed from power, preventing him from systematically murdering anyone. In this world, the immediate fallout of the Iraq War is a clusterfuck as the US government realizes they have taken it upon themselves to rebuild what they broke. This leads to a widespread insurgency, which includes the rise of an organization initially calling itself *al-Qaeda in Iraq*, and a great deal of sectarian violence. In 2007, the US decides to revise their approach, and in what is known as the *surge*, they deal a substantial blow to the insurgents. Between December 2006 and November 2007, there is a substantial decrease in sectarian violence [(Link)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Sec_Violence.jpg). By 2008, the US government evidently thought that the Iraqi government would be able to take over in the near future, and thus they signed an agreement stating that US troops would leave the country by the end of 2011. I'm not saying Iraq was stable, and I'm certainly not saying it is stable today. I'm saying it was *stabilizing*. \n\nBy the time US troops left, al-Qaeda in Iraq had cut ties with al-Qaeda and rebranded itself as the *Islamic State* that we all know and hate. Following the surge, IS had gone to ground, but just six months after the US left the country, they announced their comeback tour. By 2013 they had merged with their Syrian counterparts, kicking off the campaign that saw them slaughter their way across the Middle East until a US-led coalition stepped in (albeit a lot more quietly than the 2003 invasion).\n\nThere is a third world, where Saddam is removed from power but rather than leaving in 2011, the US actually commits to finishing what they started. This is the world I prefer. Maybe Iraq could have been another example of Japan or South Korea, or maybe the roots of sectarianism are so deep that conflict is inevitable and the country is doomed to mindless bloodshed until another genocidal dictator takes power. And in that case, you'd still be watching from the comfort of your own, unrocked boat.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how to respond to this, because you&amp;#39;re not reading what I&amp;#39;m writing.

This is something I personally support wholeheartedly, since I tend not to be a fan of genocidal dictators.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to your final point, I will yet again point out that you&amp;#39;re not reading what I&amp;#39;m writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a world where Saddam stays in power during the 2000s, and keeps systematically murdering anyone who opposes him while dabbling in a bit of light genocide against the Kurds on the side. In this world, there is no power vacuum for IS to exploit and Iraq remains a stable but tyrannical regime. This is the world you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is also the world where Saddam is removed from power, preventing him from systematically murdering anyone. In this world, the immediate fallout of the Iraq War is a clusterfuck as the US government realizes they have taken it upon themselves to rebuild what they broke. This leads to a widespread insurgency, which includes the rise of an organization initially calling itself &lt;em&gt;al-Qaeda in Iraq&lt;/em&gt;, and a great deal of sectarian violence. In 2007, the US decides to revise their approach, and in what is known as the &lt;em&gt;surge&lt;/em&gt;, they deal a substantial blow to the insurgents. Between December 2006 and November 2007, there is a substantial decrease in sectarian violence &lt;a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/Sec_Violence.jpg\"&gt;(Link)&lt;/a&gt;. By 2008, the US government evidently thought that the Iraqi government would be able to take over in the near future, and thus they signed an agreement stating that US troops would leave the country by the end of 2011. I&amp;#39;m not saying Iraq was stable, and I&amp;#39;m certainly not saying it is stable today. I&amp;#39;m saying it was &lt;em&gt;stabilizing&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time US troops left, al-Qaeda in Iraq had cut ties with al-Qaeda and rebranded itself as the &lt;em&gt;Islamic State&lt;/em&gt; that we all know and hate. Following the surge, IS had gone to ground, but just six months after the US left the country, they announced their comeback tour. By 2013 they had merged with their Syrian counterparts, kicking off the campaign that saw them slaughter their way across the Middle East until a US-led coalition stepped in (albeit a lot more quietly than the 2003 invasion).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a third world, where Saddam is removed from power but rather than leaving in 2011, the US actually commits to finishing what they started. This is the world I prefer. Maybe Iraq could have been another example of Japan or South Korea, or maybe the roots of sectarianism are so deep that conflict is inevitable and the country is doomed to mindless bloodshed until another genocidal dictator takes power. And in that case, you&amp;#39;d still be watching from the comfort of your own, unrocked boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11rpp5u", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/MurderedByWords/comments/11rpp5u/opinion_columnist_questions_credentials_gets_owned/jcc9l49/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/11rpp5u/opinion_columnist_questions_credentials_gets_owned/", "name": "t1_jcc9l49", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MurderedByWords", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678911400.0, "created_utc": 1678911400.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/ehk8w3x1hwna1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3hx3r", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Opinion columnist questions credentials, gets owned", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "MurderedByWords", "link_author": "denk2mit", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcbgiv4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "LionoftheNorth", "num_comments": 1623, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": false, "parent_id": "t1_jcb4qky", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_fh3em", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "\"Weapons of Mass Destruction\" is an umbrella term that refers to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
