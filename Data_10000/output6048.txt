It is more that the chaotic structure of the Nazi state was the result of Hitler's distaste for actually governing. Indeed, this is the major contradiction of the Nazi state: although Hitler had total and unrestrained power, he rarely desired to exercise it, having little interest in affairs which did not further his own ideological aims. His total disengagement allowed a chaotic polycratic system of government to evolve in place of a formal government, based on vague personal remits, claimed authority and patronage.\n\nThe explanation for how such an unstructured state could evolve lies not in the structure of but in the nature of power within the Nazi German state. Although individuals could employ their power to achieve their own ends, ultimately they had no real hold on the power they had amassed. Power was derived entirely from individual, personal relationships to Hitler himself. In such a situation, political power was lost, and gained, by the constant political infighting within the organisations of the state and party. Apart from a few notable exceptions, there were few solid positions within a constantly moving morass of power struggles.\n\nWith the death of Hindenburg, and the combination of the offices of Chancellor and Reich President, there were no office within the State to which Hitler was accountable. Within the party, there was no ideological position which could possibly be in opposition to Hitler. The NSDAP was primarily a charismatic movement, and its successes depended almost entirely on the role of Hitler: his position of leader and chief ideologue meant that it was practically impossible to establish any form of ideological opposition to him. The removal of Rohm in 1934, who was 'virtually alone among the higher Nazi satraps in...a position... independent of Hitler', meant ultimately that there was no longer anyone within the party of any importance who did not 'subordinate himself truly to Hitler.' Hitler's authority was absolute, and as a result the state saw increased fragmentation into polycratic groupings from this point, enabled by individual appointments by Hitler.\n\nThe new polycratic institutions were based around figures of 'little Hitlers', those who had an existing personal relationship with the Fuhrer were able to use their own connection to improve their position. NSDAP officials such as Goebbels, Goering, Himmler and Speer were endowed with their own personal fiefdoms, often in direct competition with each other or existing state organisations. Goering's installation to the Office of the Four Year Plan, on Hitler's executive order, put him into direct competition with the Cabinet Minister of Economics, Hjalmar Schacht, Speer's assumption of the position of Minister for Armaments and War Production in 1942 at Hitler's request, put him into conflict with Goering. The personalisation of politics meant that political arguments turned into personal feuds.\n\nHitler's own personal authority functioned as an 'enabler', giving 'implicit backing and sanction to those whose actions however inhumane, however radical, fell within the general and vague ideological remit of furthering the aims of the Fuhrer.' Coupled with the knowledge that any policy which was sufficiently radical would always be understood as 'working towards the Fuhrer', meant that all existing structures of the state could be destroyed and replaced by individuals battling amongst each other for power through the employment of progressively more radical policy. \n\nThis system of government rule is difficult to classify as any particular system, as it destroyed any form of governing structure, and replaced them with nothing but chaos. This chaos was polycratic in nature as power was distributed amongst various agencies, but ultimately its existence was entirely dependent upon Hitler. Hitler held the power, but distributed it almost on a whim, those under him struggling to please him as best they could.

In general, I would agree that there are things that you can learn from history, but to simply divide it into good and bad decisions, is highly difficult, and ultimately unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_8bmi82", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskHistorians/comments/8bmi82/to_what_extent_is_it_possible_to_learn_from/dx8mhiq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8bmi82/to_what_extent_is_it_possible_to_learn_from/", "name": "t1_dx8mhiq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1523536977.0, "created_utc": 1523536977.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8bmi82/to_what_extent_is_it_possible_to_learn_from/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How did archers keep their arrows?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "link_author": "Persia029", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dx7ko4r", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Hanrohan", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dx7dfjd", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_7ptp7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, apologies, I was focused pretty much on just the on foot, and medieval.

(Those who had been imprisoned for membership of banned organisations, rather than political violence)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point is, the end of Apartheid was a gradual process, taking about four years, between de Klerk&amp;#39;s election in 1990 and the first universally democratic vote in 1994 which elected Mandela&amp;#39;s national unity government. Incidentally, de Klerk took the position of deputy president under Mandela, a position in which he remained until 1996. In 1993, de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize for their work in ending apartheid and forming the new democratic constitution of South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, de Klerk is definitely not a saint, his earlier politics were mostly pro segregation, if not pro apartheid. Just as Mandela was also not a total saint. Both men were pragmatists, who worked together towards a relatively bloodless ending to a brutal system of oppression, the future of which was rapidly disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3i3dk7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskHistorians/comments/3i3dk7/why_did_south_africa_end_its_apartheid_system/cuds1gu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3i3dk7/why_did_south_africa_end_its_apartheid_system/", "name": "t1_cuds1gu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1440415505.0, "created_utc": 1440415505.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3i3dk7/why_did_south_africa_end_its_apartheid_system/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Who were Donatello and Raphael during the Renaissance, and why are they not as popular as Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo when taught in school?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "link_author": "AThinker2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cu6u29d", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Hanrohan", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cu5wp61", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_7ptp7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Isaac Newton's 'If I have seen further...
