For lunch, I&amp;#39;d talk with the school, but maybe they could assign your daughter a buddy for a little while to help her get to lunch and also maybe you could get her some headphones to help deaden the noise - not completely block her hearing, but just reduce it to a more manageable level. Also, with the buddy, if she has someone she can consistently sit with and expect most days, it should help her be more comfortable. Similarly, for recess, perhaps the teacher could assist in matching her up with a smaller group of kids and she&amp;#39;d be happier to play that way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the anxiety itself, I&amp;#39;d work on a few anxiety-relief techniques with her. The internet has TONs of them. You&amp;#39;ll need to practice with her at home quite often for a while before she&amp;#39;s really able to exercise them on her own. Things like taking some deep breaths, stretching, getting some water, etc. Also, really naming feelings and emotions can be helpful in getting her to express herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_cqamh5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Parenting/comments/cqamh5/daughter_cries_every_morning_before_school_need/ewvuqux/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/cqamh5/daughter_cries_every_morning_before_school_need/", "name": "t1_ewvuqux", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parenting", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1565814370.0, "created_utc": 1565814370.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/cqamh5/daughter_cries_every_morning_before_school_need/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r6jl", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Despise My Son's Father.

You can set a deadline goal - maybe by Jan 31, 2020 she has to move out. Then, starting with September, she needs to pay you guys more in rent to practice budgeting. I'd look with her and see what she would be looking at paying for a place with room mates. And then also make sure she practices buying food/groceries and other household goods. \n\nWith the increased rent she pays you, I think it would be generous of you to save that for her so she can use it on moving expenses. The point is though is that she doesn't have access to the money to spend it, just as she wouldn't have it if it were going towards rent/other household items. \n\nDo you feel like she has a reasonable amount of life skills? I mean it sounds like she can keep a job, drive, and pay some bills. Does she cook, clean, do her own laundry?\n\nMy guess is that she's just not particularly motivated to finish school/find a career - sounds like she's not super sure of what she wants to do - and that's fine, but doesn't change that she's nearing 30 and its time to be more independent. Perhaps once she is living on her own she will be more motivated to stick with one major, or even find another career entirely that doesn't involve traditional college.

Sex is a normal, biological process, and is only taboo because society has deemed it as such (as a method of control). \n\nNow, obviously, not every topic is appropriate at every age. But its not inappropriate for even a toddler to know that (usually) mommies have eggs in her belly, and (usually) daddies have sperm that come out of their penis, and to make a baby, a daddy shoots his sperm into a mommy's belly through an opening in her vagina and the sperm hits the egg and they mush together and then a baby grows.

Usually the answer is because we've put all of these other connotations on it.

That doesn't make it any more taboo though! It is still perfectly normal and not something that needs to be completely hidden from children (not suggesting anyone just start having sex in the living room in front of their kids, I'm referring to hiding the concept of sex from kids).

I think when you talk to your daughter, it will be important to not only explain the logistics, but also that yeah, sex feels good and adults do it for fun. Whereas when you talk to your son, follow his lead, but just start with the very basics in logistics and go from there.
