If you have already tried open communication and cannot move past any current issues, it may be beneficial to seek therapy. That said, there are certain things that some people are just not comfortable doing; it is up to the two of you to determine if this is a deal-breaker or merely one boundary that you want to set for your relationship.\n\n&gt;I just don't feel like I can talk to her properly.\n\nOpen, honest, and respectful communication between two partners is vital to any relationship. It doesn't (usually) come naturally during periods of strife between partners, you have to create a relationship that supports trust and patience. It's particularly hard because both partners need to be receptive to the other partner's point of view, and commit to finding common ground from which to build from. It helps to ask yourself why you aren't comfortable talking to her about any issues you have - is she going to be hurt, act defensively, break things, leave?\n\n&gt;She's just not at all interested in what I want to talk about, and all she seems to talk about is what her friends are doing and stuff she's seen on tumblr. I want to talk about bigger things than how cute that tiny piglet is. It's all small talk. It's got to the stage where I hardly say anything to her at all because I just can't think of anything that is better than silence.\n\nPersonally, I think that your current relationship is at a point where it will be hard to save. You are no longer sexually compatible, you feel smothered by a lack of personal time, you do not share common interests, you no longer have open communication. While every relationship has rough patches, it will take serious and honest commitment from both of you to save your relationship.\n\n[edit] Thank you for the gold.", "edited": 1409318886.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things just for me, like woodworking, listening to music through a really good amp, and painting.
