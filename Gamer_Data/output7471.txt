Luckily we aren't to far along in this campaign, we are only level 2's so it shouldn't take long. (I know what you are thinking, I killed him at level two, prick move.... Anyway...) \n\nOur campaign takes place in a country called \"Deep Wells.\" Merely 100 years ago a great war took place, nearly obliterating the the land. The most destructive of all weapons was indeed, magic. Once the war was over, a society that goes by the name of \"The Arc\" stepped in and basically outlawed the use of magic. In order to cast, you must have a contract given to you by the Arc; still these contracts are hard to come by and don't allow much practical use at all. In addition, towns must not exceed their given quota.\n\nWhen my character (Gideon) was young, he grew up in a fairly wealthy family of alchemists; quite talented ones at that. Gideon was never without a tutor or his books, and that's exactly the way he liked it. When he came of age, his parents let him in on a deadly secret; they were practicing Wizards. It was their belief that not only was magic a useful and beneficial tool, it was a right. They despised the Arc for what they had done to such an ancient art, and because of this they decided to keep the tradition alive through Gideon.\n\nUnfortunately, only a few years after he had begun his training, a horrible event took place. Their small town of Crown-Shire had been sacked by a large group of marauders. Not many escaped, and the ones who were less fortunate were either killed or enslaved. Gideon was taken from his family and put on a wagon traveling somewhere to the south. This is where the Paladin comes in. On that long ride, Gideon made a close friend, Regdar (yes, very unoriginal but this friend of mine isn't very fond of thinking up names.) Regdar became an outlet for Gideon, someone he could confide in.\n\nA few weeks in, while the caravans were stopped for the night, something explosive happened. The caravans were attacked, breaking the locks. When Gideon and Regdar began to flee, they noticed these weren't just any attackers, they were the Paladins of the Arc. When Regdar stepped out of the wagon, his ankle had twisted allowing him to go no further. Gideon was forced to go on without him, never to see his friend for years to come. Gideon traveled by foot to the nearest city where he made a living for himself by the craft his parents had taught him, with hopes and dreams of someday reuniting with his parents, and his friend.\n\nFast forward a couple of years, and he received a letter in the mail, from the Arc. You see, since Deep Wells is simply too large for the Arc to patrol, the citizens are required to fulfill a randomly selected \"Anti-Magical Duty.\" Kinda like our equivalent to jury duty. This is how our adventuring party met. You see, a small town along the western border by the name of \"Haroway\" (hair-oh-way) had been consistently going above and beyond their magic quota. This was due to a certain holiday the town holds once a year \"Fright Night.\" Fright Night is when Bards from all across the land get together to celebrate the ghosts and spirits that roam this area. The cause of this is said to be a small mountain cave which acts as a portal to \"the Harrowing;\" basically the ancient dwarven myth passed down from generation to generation similar to the afterlife. The Arc had commanded our party to cast a spell, sealing this portal doing away with the ghosts once and for all.\n\nNow of course, Fright Night brings in a great deal of tourism each year, and the last thing the mayor and merchants want done is the sealing of this gate. So he offered us an illusion scroll that when casted would make the portal appear to be shut. This way when the Arc officials come to inspect, they will believe the job was done. Now a majority of us in this group were magic casters anyway, and had pretty close bond with the Arcane. Except one. Regdar the Paladin. He had been indoctrinated by the Arc. When we finally reached the cave, and overcame it's obstacles, we were in the room with the portal.

Luckily we aren&amp;#39;t to far along in this campaign, we are only level 2&amp;#39;s so it shouldn&amp;#39;t take long. (I know what you are thinking, I killed him at level two, prick move.... Anyway...) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our campaign takes place in a country called &amp;quot;Deep Wells.&amp;quot; Merely 100 years ago a great war took place, nearly obliterating the the land. The most destructive of all weapons was indeed, magic. Once the war was over, a society that goes by the name of &amp;quot;The Arc&amp;quot; stepped in and basically outlawed the use of magic. In order to cast, you must have a contract given to you by the Arc; still these contracts are hard to come by and don&amp;#39;t allow much practical use at all. In addition, towns must not exceed their given quota.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When my character (Gideon) was young, he grew up in a fairly wealthy family of alchemists; quite talented ones at that. Gideon was never without a tutor or his books, and that&amp;#39;s exactly the way he liked it. When he came of age, his parents let him in on a deadly secret; they were practicing Wizards. It was their belief that not only was magic a useful and beneficial tool, it was a right. They despised the Arc for what they had done to such an ancient art, and because of this they decided to keep the tradition alive through Gideon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, only a few years after he had begun his training, a horrible event took place. Their small town of Crown-Shire had been sacked by a large group of marauders. Not many escaped, and the ones who were less fortunate were either killed or enslaved. Gideon was taken from his family and put on a wagon traveling somewhere to the south. This is where the Paladin comes in. On that long ride, Gideon made a close friend, Regdar (yes, very unoriginal but this friend of mine isn&amp;#39;t very fond of thinking up names.) Regdar became an outlet for Gideon, someone he could confide in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few weeks in, while the caravans were stopped for the night, something explosive happened. The caravans were attacked, breaking the locks. When Gideon and Regdar began to flee, they noticed these weren&amp;#39;t just any attackers, they were the Paladins of the Arc. When Regdar stepped out of the wagon, his ankle had twisted allowing him to go no further. Gideon was forced to go on without him, never to see his friend for years to come. Gideon traveled by foot to the nearest city where he made a living for himself by the craft his parents had taught him, with hopes and dreams of someday reuniting with his parents, and his friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a couple of years, and he received a letter in the mail, from the Arc. You see, since Deep Wells is simply too large for the Arc to patrol, the citizens are required to fulfill a randomly selected &amp;quot;Anti-Magical Duty.&amp;quot; Kinda like our equivalent to jury duty. This is how our adventuring party met. You see, a small town along the western border by the name of &amp;quot;Haroway&amp;quot; (hair-oh-way) had been consistently going above and beyond their magic quota. This was due to a certain holiday the town holds once a year &amp;quot;Fright Night.&amp;quot; Fright Night is when Bards from all across the land get together to celebrate the ghosts and spirits that roam this area. The cause of this is said to be a small mountain cave which acts as a portal to &amp;quot;the Harrowing;&amp;quot; basically the ancient dwarven myth passed down from generation to generation similar to the afterlife. The Arc had commanded our party to cast a spell, sealing this portal doing away with the ghosts once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now of course, Fright Night brings in a great deal of tourism each year, and the last thing the mayor and merchants want done is the sealing of this gate. So he offered us an illusion scroll that when casted would make the portal appear to be shut. This way when the Arc officials come to inspect, they will believe the job was done. Now a majority of us in this group were magic casters anyway, and had pretty close bond with the Arcane. Except one. Regdar the Paladin. He had been indoctrinated by the Arc. When we finally reached the cave, and overcame it&amp;#39;s obstacles, we were in the room with the portal.
