As I work my way through various 3D printing options, I\u2019ve been writing up my experiences. As I dive into 3D printing, the lack of extensive documentation and reviews of what is good, what is bad, and what works with care, has been vexing to me, so my hope is to provide a little bit of what I wish was readily available for me when I started!\n\n-----\n\nToday\u2019s focus is on 3DBreed, which is a studio offering a variety of soldiers, vehicles, and terrain both for World War II and other historical conflicts. They have run several WWII Kickstarters in the past under their \"March to Hell\" banner, most [recently focused on the North African campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joinordie/march-to-hell-ww2-africa), and also offer their models either a la carte, or as post-campaign bundles, [on their own storefront site](https://www.3dbreed.es/mth-ww2-2021/).\n\nFor this review, I acquired a mix of vehicle, terrain, and mini-figures that 3DBreed offers.\n\n**Printing**\n\nAll of the models were printed either on on an Elegoo Mars 3 Pro, using either Elegoo standard resin, or Phrozen 4k resin, or else on a Prusa MK3s+, either a .4mm or .25mm nozzle using Prusament or Hatchbox PLA filament.\n\nFor tests in resin, I printed out a selection of mini-figures, as well as a vehicle. The figures all printed without issue, using both the pre-supported options they include, as well as adding supports myself to the unsupported models. The pre-supports were nicely done and came off easily. No complaints to be had!\n\n3DBreed bills their models as being FDM-friendly designs, so in addition to resin tests, I also tested some prints on FDM. I've previously printed out some tanks and terrain, as they were in fact some of the first models I got after buying an FDM printer. Both the tanks and the terrain are very easy prints. Supports are required for some places, but they are clearly designed to be easy prints, and hard to not be pleased with the result.\n\nHowever this was my first attempt at printing out the mini-figures. While supports are definitely required, I was pretty pleased with the results compared to a few tests I'd done with other 28mm figure designs I'd tried before, but that comes with a few caveats.\n\nIn the first, while the style that 3DBreed is designed in about as conducive as one could hope for to print mini-figures on an FDM printer, there still is a loss of detail compared to a resin print. That isn't to say they are *bad* of course. At table distance they are definitely decent with the .4mm nozzle, using .07mm layer height, and there is some improvement even when switching to the .25mm nozzle at .05mm layer height, but the difference *is* noticeable.\n\nSecond then is just the time commitment. It can take several hours for a single figure to print depending on how fine you want the settings to be, and supports are definitely a good deal more intensive a process to remove than the resin prints. I would say if someone were inclined to, printing even a single squad on FDM would probably be not much different in time than basically a full 1000 pt army in resin. Resin I know just can't be used by some due to circumstances, and if you are limited, this is a great option there, but it'll take awhile!\n\n**The Models**\n\nLet's put the obvious out there first. 3DBreed miniatures are *chonkybois.* The style of the figures is very cartoonish, with the features exaggerated far beyond even 'heroic scale'. To be honest, I'm not completely a fan (I kind like them, but I wouldn't want to make an army using them, if that makes sense), but all the same it is very much an intentional stylistic approach, and within that frame, the models are really well executed, with nice detail work, and solid designs. If you like how they look, you definitely will be happy with the figures you get, but if you care about consistency, they might look a little out of sorts mixed in with an army incorporating other designs.\n\nTo that regard, there some options though. In the first, the scale of the 28mm figures is more like 32mm, so slightly bigger than Warlord Games and similar. Scaling down slightly when printing can help them fit in a bit. If you want to get a little more adventurous, it was recommended to me to try playing with the ratios. Printing at a Z axis ratio of 95%, and bringing the X and Y down to 85%, helps slim down the figures considerably. Not to say that they aren't still beefy, and the features still noticeably exaggerated, but the change is also appreciable I feel and helps them blend in a little bit with other styles.\n\nFor the vehicles, while the designs aren't done to the same degree as the figures so as to feel cartoonish, they do feel slightly exaggerated as well, but they fit in much better with other styles. This also means that details aren't quite as deep as some creators, and they also generally have the 'flat backing' style on tank treads instead of the cut out style. It makes for really great FDM prints, but while they certainly can look nice printed in resin, they end up feeling kind of basic.\n\nIt is also worth noting that some of the designs are, well... bad. I'm not sure if it is a factor of the simplification, or just a straight up *error.* Most egregious that I noticed looking through the catalog is their Sd.Kfz. 231 which literally doesn't have enough wheels! In reality there was a 6 rad and an 8 rad, but there was no 4 rad... which is how many wheels the 3DBreed version has. Most models don't seem to have such sloppy oversights as this, but it still stands out. And even when there aren't outright errors, there is... iffiness to be aware of too (see next section)\n\nAs for the terrain, it is generally decent stuff, and all FDM friendly, but on the whole the buildings are bit simplistic. They just don't stand out as being particularly well detailed. Painted up they look nice enough, to be sure, but just nothing spectacular. It isn't that hard to find comparable quality pieces from other creators, even some of the free stuff on Thingiverse seeming about the same level I would say. The stuff I liked best of what I've gotten is the destroyed vehicles, which make for nice bits of scatter terrain.\n\n**The Offerings**\n\nIf the 3DBreed style is your jam, you won't be hurting for options any time soon. They have a deep back catalog of figures and vehicles, covering all of the major Bolt Action combatants (UK, UK, USSR, Japan, Germany), as well as several minor factions including the French, Italians, and Australians, and usually with a good variety of infantry types, and also decent selection of the major vehicles used by those nations. All of the campaigns have also included terrain as well, so there is a range of options there too. \n\nThe biggest caveat I would *specifically* highlight is that while they offer \"variants\" of many vehicles, it generally isn't *accurate* variants. The Panzer IV for instance has a five different options, but the only thing changed is the gun, with five different options, but only one hull design, and one turret design (one and a half, I guess, as some have Schurzen armor on them, but are otherwise the same too). If you just want to have some table-distance visual variety, or the ability to quickly swap out turrets to have maximum flexibility with minimum models, this is probably sufficient for many players, but as noted with the accuracy issues before, for someone who wants any appreciable level of correctness, you simply aren't going to find it here, and I would say even other FDM-centric creators are going to offer more detailed, more accurate options.\n\nBeyond what is available now, they seem to have a fairly steady pace of new Kickstarter campaigns *(although their current one is Vietnam focused, not WWII)* so there are likely more to come in the near future as well.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nFor the FDM printer, this is probably the absolute best option you will find if you want to try printing out a complete army, as they really are a step ahead of the rest in terms of their printability for filament. For the resin printer, the figures are well executed on a technical level, but their style is simply too out there for them to be a *general* option for everyone, and despite the appreciable depth that they offer, you really need to like the look for this to work for you. That isn't a knock against them, as it is a matter of taste, but it is limiting all the same.\n\nAs for the rest, there is likewise a depth of options for vehicles, but for the resin printer, there is nothing that makes these stand out against other options unless they are the *only* option for the particular vehicle you are looking for. For the FDM printer, they still aren't exceptional, but they are definitely solid and you can be assured of a good print with little complications. And then finally terrain, again there isn't much that stands out about their offerings. They make for a nice enough addition to a Kickstarter campaign, perhaps, but there isn't that much they have which can't be found elsewhere and nicer looking.\n\nSo on the whole, 3DBreed ends up being a bit of a mixed bag. They have their obvious strengths, but there are some definite cons. As long as you like their look, they are a really strong option for building out your army, but especially outside of the mini-figures, I wouldn't consider them a first stop.\n\n-------\n\nIf you like these reviews and want to help me keep doing them, you can toss a buck via [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/gk_zhukov) and a [Buymecoffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhukov).

As I work my way through various 3D printing options, I\u2019ve been writing up my experiences. As I dive into 3D printing, the lack of extensive documentation and reviews of what is good, what is bad, and what works with care, has been vexing to me, so my hope is to provide a little bit of what I wish was readily available for me when I started!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today\u2019s focus is on 3DBreed, which is a studio offering a variety of soldiers, vehicles, and terrain both for World War II and other historical conflicts. They have run several WWII Kickstarters in the past under their &amp;quot;March to Hell&amp;quot; banner, most &lt;a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joinordie/march-to-hell-ww2-africa\"&gt;recently focused on the North African campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and also offer their models either a la carte, or as post-campaign bundles, &lt;a href=\"https://www.3dbreed.es/mth-ww2-2021/\"&gt;on their own storefront site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this review, I acquired a mix of vehicle, terrain, and mini-figures that 3DBreed offers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Printing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the models were printed either on on an Elegoo Mars 3 Pro, using either Elegoo standard resin, or Phrozen 4k resin, or else on a Prusa MK3s+, either a .4mm or .25mm nozzle using Prusament or Hatchbox PLA filament.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For tests in resin, I printed out a selection of mini-figures, as well as a vehicle. The figures all printed without issue, using both the pre-supported options they include, as well as adding supports myself to the unsupported models. The pre-supports were nicely done and came off easily. No complaints to be had!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3DBreed bills their models as being FDM-friendly designs, so in addition to resin tests, I also tested some prints on FDM. I&amp;#39;ve previously printed out some tanks and terrain, as they were in fact some of the first models I got after buying an FDM printer. Both the tanks and the terrain are very easy prints. Supports are required for some places, but they are clearly designed to be easy prints, and hard to not be pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However this was my first attempt at printing out the mini-figures. While supports are definitely required, I was pretty pleased with the results compared to a few tests I&amp;#39;d done with other 28mm figure designs I&amp;#39;d tried before, but that comes with a few caveats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first, while the style that 3DBreed is designed in about as conducive as one could hope for to print mini-figures on an FDM printer, there still is a loss of detail compared to a resin print. That isn&amp;#39;t to say they are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; of course. At table distance they are definitely decent with the .4mm nozzle, using .07mm layer height, and there is some improvement even when switching to the .25mm nozzle at .05mm layer height, but the difference &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second then is just the time commitment. It can take several hours for a single figure to print depending on how fine you want the settings to be, and supports are definitely a good deal more intensive a process to remove than the resin prints. I would say if someone were inclined to, printing even a single squad on FDM would probably be not much different in time than basically a full 1000 pt army in resin. Resin I know just can&amp;#39;t be used by some due to circumstances, and if you are limited, this is a great option there, but it&amp;#39;ll take awhile!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s put the obvious out there first. 3DBreed miniatures are &lt;em&gt;chonkybois.&lt;/em&gt; The style of the figures is very cartoonish, with the features exaggerated far beyond even &amp;#39;heroic scale&amp;#39;. To be honest, I&amp;#39;m not completely a fan (I kind like them, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to make an army using them, if that makes sense), but all the same it is very much an intentional stylistic approach, and within that frame, the models are really well executed, with nice detail work, and solid designs. If you like how they look, you definitely will be happy with the figures you get, but if you care about consistency, they might look a little out of sorts mixed in with an army incorporating other designs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To that regard, there some options though. In the first, the scale of the 28mm figures is more like 32mm, so slightly bigger than Warlord Games and similar. Scaling down slightly when printing can help them fit in a bit. If you want to get a little more adventurous, it was recommended to me to try playing with the ratios. Printing at a Z axis ratio of 95%, and bringing the X and Y down to 85%, helps slim down the figures considerably. Not to say that they aren&amp;#39;t still beefy, and the features still noticeably exaggerated, but the change is also appreciable I feel and helps them blend in a little bit with other styles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the vehicles, while the designs aren&amp;#39;t done to the same degree as the figures so as to feel cartoonish, they do feel slightly exaggerated as well, but they fit in much better with other styles. This also means that details aren&amp;#39;t quite as deep as some creators, and they also generally have the &amp;#39;flat backing&amp;#39; style on tank treads instead of the cut out style. It makes for really great FDM prints, but while they certainly can look nice printed in resin, they end up feeling kind of basic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that some of the designs are, well... bad. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it is a factor of the simplification, or just a straight up &lt;em&gt;error.&lt;/em&gt; Most egregious that I noticed looking through the catalog is their Sd.Kfz. 231 which literally doesn&amp;#39;t have enough wheels! In reality there was a 6 rad and an 8 rad, but there was no 4 rad... which is how many wheels the 3DBreed version has. Most models don&amp;#39;t seem to have such sloppy oversights as this, but it still stands out. And even when there aren&amp;#39;t outright errors, there is... iffiness to be aware of too (see next section)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the terrain, it is generally decent stuff, and all FDM friendly, but on the whole the buildings are bit simplistic. They just don&amp;#39;t stand out as being particularly well detailed. Painted up they look nice enough, to be sure, but just nothing spectacular. It isn&amp;#39;t that hard to find comparable quality pieces from other creators, even some of the free stuff on Thingiverse seeming about the same level I would say. The stuff I liked best of what I&amp;#39;ve gotten is the destroyed vehicles, which make for nice bits of scatter terrain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Offerings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the 3DBreed style is your jam, you won&amp;#39;t be hurting for options any time soon. They have a deep back catalog of figures and vehicles, covering all of the major Bolt Action combatants (UK, UK, USSR, Japan, Germany), as well as several minor factions including the French, Italians, and Australians, and usually with a good variety of infantry types, and also decent selection of the major vehicles used by those nations. All of the campaigns have also included terrain as well, so there is a range of options there too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest caveat I would &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; highlight is that while they offer &amp;quot;variants&amp;quot; of many vehicles, it generally isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; variants. The Panzer IV for instance has a five different options, but the only thing changed is the gun, with five different options, but only one hull design, and one turret design (one and a half, I guess, as some have Schurzen armor on them, but are otherwise the same too).

As I work my way through various 3D printing options, I\u2019ve been writing up my experiences. As I dive into 3D printing, the lack of extensive documentation and reviews of what is good, what is bad, and what works with care, has been vexing to me, so my hope is to provide a little bit of what I wish was readily available for me when I started!\n\n-----\n\nToday\u2019s focus is on 3DBreed, which is a studio offering a variety of soldiers, vehicles, and terrain both for World War II and other historical conflicts. They have run several WWII Kickstarters in the past under their \"March to Hell\" banner, most [recently focused on the North African campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joinordie/march-to-hell-ww2-africa), and also offer their models either a la carte, or as post-campaign bundles, [on their own storefront site](https://www.3dbreed.es/mth-ww2-2021/).\n\nFor this review, I acquired a mix of vehicle, terrain, and mini-figures that 3DBreed offers.\n\n**Printing**\n\nAll of the models were printed either on on an Elegoo Mars 3 Pro, using either Elegoo standard resin, or Phrozen 4k resin, or else on a Prusa MK3s+, either a .4mm or .25mm nozzle using Prusament or Hatchbox PLA filament.\n\nFor tests in resin, I printed out a selection of mini-figures, as well as a vehicle.

Resin I know just can't be used by some due to circumstances, and if you are limited, this is a great option there, but it'll take awhile!\n\n**The Models**\n\nLet's put the obvious out there first. 3DBreed miniatures are *chonkybois.* The style of the figures is very cartoonish, with the features exaggerated far beyond even 'heroic scale'. To be honest, I'm not completely a fan (I kind like them, but I wouldn't want to make an army using them, if that makes sense), but all the same it is very much an intentional stylistic approach, and within that frame, the models are really well executed, with nice detail work, and solid designs. If you like how they look, you definitely will be happy with the figures you get, but if you care about consistency, they might look a little out of sorts mixed in with an army incorporating other designs.\n\nTo that regard, there some options though.

This also means that details aren't quite as deep as some creators, and they also generally have the 'flat backing' style on tank treads instead of the cut out style. It makes for really great FDM prints, but while they certainly can look nice printed in resin, they end up feeling kind of basic.\n\nIt is also worth noting that some of the designs are, well... bad. I'm not sure if it is a factor of the simplification, or just a straight up *error.* Most egregious that I noticed looking through the catalog is their Sd.Kfz. 231 which literally doesn't have enough wheels! In reality there was a 6 rad and an 8 rad, but there was no 4 rad... which is how many wheels the 3DBreed version has. Most models don't seem to have such sloppy oversights as this, but it still stands out. And even when there aren't outright errors, there is... iffiness to be aware of too (see next section)\n\nAs for the terrain, it is generally decent stuff, and all FDM friendly, but on the whole the buildings are bit simplistic. They just don't stand out as being particularly well detailed. Painted up they look nice enough, to be sure, but just nothing spectacular. It isn't that hard to find comparable quality pieces from other creators, even some of the free stuff on Thingiverse seeming about the same level I would say. The stuff I liked best of what I've gotten is the destroyed vehicles, which make for nice bits of scatter terrain.\n\n**The Offerings**\n\nIf the 3DBreed style is your jam, you won't be hurting for options any time soon. They have a deep back catalog of figures and vehicles, covering all of the major Bolt Action combatants (UK, UK, USSR, Japan, Germany), as well as several minor factions including the French, Italians, and Australians, and usually with a good variety of infantry types, and also decent selection of the major vehicles used by those nations. All of the campaigns have also included terrain as well, so there is a range of options there too. \n\nThe biggest caveat I would *specifically* highlight is that while they offer \"variants\" of many vehicles, it generally isn't *accurate* variants. The Panzer IV for instance has a five different options, but the only thing changed is the gun, with five different options, but only one hull design, and one turret design (one and a half, I guess, as some have Schurzen armor on them, but are otherwise the same too). If you just want to have some table-distance visual variety, or the ability to quickly swap out turrets to have maximum flexibility with minimum models, this is probably sufficient for many players, but as noted with the accuracy issues before, for someone who wants any appreciable level of correctness, you simply aren't going to find it here, and I would say even other FDM-centric creators are going to offer more detailed, more accurate options.\n\nBeyond what is available now, they seem to have a fairly steady pace of new Kickstarter campaigns *(although their current one is Vietnam focused, not WWII)* so there are likely more to come in the near future as well.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nFor the FDM printer, this is probably the absolute best option you will find if you want to try printing out a complete army, as they really are a step ahead of the rest in terms of their printability for filament. For the resin printer, the figures are well executed on a technical level, but their style is simply too out there for them to be a *general* option for everyone, and despite the appreciable depth that they offer, you really need to like the look for this to work for you. That isn't a knock against them, as it is a matter of taste, but it is limiting all the same.\n\nAs for the rest, there is likewise a depth of options for vehicles, but for the resin printer, there is nothing that makes these stand out against other options unless they are the *only* option for the particular vehicle you are looking for. For the FDM printer, they still aren't exceptional, but they are definitely solid and you can be assured of a good print with little complications. And then finally terrain, again there isn't much that stands out about their offerings. They make for a nice enough addition to a Kickstarter campaign, perhaps, but there isn't that much they have which can't be found elsewhere and nicer looking.\n\nSo on the whole, 3DBreed ends up being a bit of a mixed bag. They have their obvious strengths, but there are some definite cons. As long as you like their look, they are a really strong option for building out your army, but especially outside of the mini-figures, I wouldn't consider them a first stop.\n\n**For Previous Reviews check /r/PrintedWWII** a selection of which are provided below:\n\n* [Madox](/r/boltaction/comments/ytcpg8/) \\- A\n* [JuSM](/r/boltaction/comments/100sbwf/) \\- A \n* [Arvernes](/r/boltaction/comments/107pyic/) \\- A \n* [Wargame3D](/r/boltaction/comments/11i1n58/) \\- A \n* [NSM](/r/PrintedWWII/comments/11opwy2/) \\- A \n\nIf you like these reviews and want to help me keep doing them, you can toss a buck via [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/gk_zhukov) and a [Buymecoffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhukov).

As I work my way through various 3D printing options, I\u2019ve been writing up my experiences. As I dive into 3D printing, the lack of extensive documentation and reviews of what is good, what is bad, and what works with care, has been vexing to me, so my hope is to provide a little bit of what I wish was readily available for me when I started!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today\u2019s focus is on 3DBreed, which is a studio offering a variety of soldiers, vehicles, and terrain both for World War II and other historical conflicts. They have run several WWII Kickstarters in the past under their &amp;quot;March to Hell&amp;quot; banner, most &lt;a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joinordie/march-to-hell-ww2-africa\"&gt;recently focused on the North African campaign&lt;/a&gt;, and also offer their models either a la carte, or as post-campaign bundles, &lt;a href=\"https://www.3dbreed.es/mth-ww2-2021/\"&gt;on their own storefront site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this review, I acquired a mix of vehicle, terrain, and mini-figures that 3DBreed offers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Printing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the models were printed either on on an Elegoo Mars 3 Pro, using either Elegoo standard resin, or Phrozen 4k resin, or else on a Prusa MK3s+, either a .4mm or .25mm nozzle using Prusament or Hatchbox PLA filament.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For tests in resin, I printed out a selection of mini-figures, as well as a vehicle. The figures all printed without issue, using both the pre-supported options they include, as well as adding supports myself to the unsupported models. The pre-supports were nicely done and came off easily. No complaints to be had!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3DBreed bills their models as being FDM-friendly designs, so in addition to resin tests, I also tested some prints on FDM. I&amp;#39;ve previously printed out some tanks and terrain, as they were in fact some of the first models I got after buying an FDM printer. Both the tanks and the terrain are very easy prints. Supports are required for some places, but they are clearly designed to be easy prints, and hard to not be pleased with the result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However this was my first attempt at printing out the mini-figures. While supports are definitely required, I was pretty pleased with the results compared to a few tests I&amp;#39;d done with other 28mm figure designs I&amp;#39;d tried before, but that comes with a few caveats.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first, while the style that 3DBreed is designed in about as conducive as one could hope for to print mini-figures on an FDM printer, there still is a loss of detail compared to a resin print. That isn&amp;#39;t to say they are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; of course. At table distance they are definitely decent with the .4mm nozzle, using .07mm layer height, and there is some improvement even when switching to the .25mm nozzle at .05mm layer height, but the difference &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second then is just the time commitment. It can take several hours for a single figure to print depending on how fine you want the settings to be, and supports are definitely a good deal more intensive a process to remove than the resin prints. I would say if someone were inclined to, printing even a single squad on FDM would probably be not much different in time than basically a full 1000 pt army in resin. Resin I know just can&amp;#39;t be used by some due to circumstances, and if you are limited, this is a great option there, but it&amp;#39;ll take awhile!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s put the obvious out there first. 3DBreed miniatures are &lt;em&gt;chonkybois.&lt;/em&gt; The style of the figures is very cartoonish, with the features exaggerated far beyond even &amp;#39;heroic scale&amp;#39;. To be honest, I&amp;#39;m not completely a fan (I kind like them, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to make an army using them, if that makes sense), but all the same it is very much an intentional stylistic approach, and within that frame, the models are really well executed, with nice detail work, and solid designs. If you like how they look, you definitely will be happy with the figures you get, but if you care about consistency, they might look a little out of sorts mixed in with an army incorporating other designs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To that regard, there some options though. In the first, the scale of the 28mm figures is more like 32mm, so slightly bigger than Warlord Games and similar. Scaling down slightly when printing can help them fit in a bit. If you want to get a little more adventurous, it was recommended to me to try playing with the ratios. Printing at a Z axis ratio of 95%, and bringing the X and Y down to 85%, helps slim down the figures considerably. Not to say that they aren&amp;#39;t still beefy, and the features still noticeably exaggerated, but the change is also appreciable I feel and helps them blend in a little bit with other styles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the vehicles, while the designs aren&amp;#39;t done to the same degree as the figures so as to feel cartoonish, they do feel slightly exaggerated as well, but they fit in much better with other styles. This also means that details aren&amp;#39;t quite as deep as some creators, and they also generally have the &amp;#39;flat backing&amp;#39; style on tank treads instead of the cut out style. It makes for really great FDM prints, but while they certainly can look nice printed in resin, they end up feeling kind of basic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that some of the designs are, well... bad. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it is a factor of the simplification, or just a straight up &lt;em&gt;error.&lt;/em&gt; Most egregious that I noticed looking through the catalog is their Sd.Kfz. 231 which literally doesn&amp;#39;t have enough wheels! In reality there was a 6 rad and an 8 rad, but there was no 4 rad... which is how many wheels the 3DBreed version has. Most models don&amp;#39;t seem to have such sloppy oversights as this, but it still stands out. And even when there aren&amp;#39;t outright errors, there is... iffiness to be aware of too (see next section)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the terrain, it is generally decent stuff, and all FDM friendly, but on the whole the buildings are bit simplistic. They just don&amp;#39;t stand out as being particularly well detailed. Painted up they look nice enough, to be sure, but just nothing spectacular. It isn&amp;#39;t that hard to find comparable quality pieces from other creators, even some of the free stuff on Thingiverse seeming about the same level I would say. The stuff I liked best of what I&amp;#39;ve gotten is the destroyed vehicles, which make for nice bits of scatter terrain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Offerings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the 3DBreed style is your jam, you won&amp;#39;t be hurting for options any time soon. They have a deep back catalog of figures and vehicles, covering all of the major Bolt Action combatants (UK, UK, USSR, Japan, Germany), as well as several minor factions including the French, Italians, and Australians, and usually with a good variety of infantry types, and also decent selection of the major vehicles used by those nations. All of the campaigns have also included terrain as well, so there is a range of options there too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest caveat I would &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; highlight is that while they offer &amp;quot;variants&amp;quot; of many vehicles, it generally isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; variants. The Panzer IV for instance has a five different options, but the only thing changed is the gun, with five different options, but only one hull design, and one turret design (one and a half, I guess, as some have Schurzen armor on them, but are otherwise the same too). If you just want to have some table-distance visual variety, or the ability to quickly swap out turrets to have maximum flexibility with minimum models, this is probably sufficient for many players, but as noted with the accuracy issues before, for someone who wants any appreciable level of correctness, you simply aren&amp;#39;t going to find it here, and I would say even other FDM-centric creators are going to offer more detailed, more accurate options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond what is available now, they seem to have a fairly steady pace of new Kickstarter campaigns &lt;em&gt;(although their current one is Vietnam focused, not WWII)&lt;/em&gt; so there are likely more to come in the near future as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the FDM printer, this is probably the absolute best option you will find if you want to try printing out a complete army, as they really are a step ahead of the rest in terms of their printability for filament. For the resin printer, the figures are well executed on a technical level, but their style is simply too out there for them to be a &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; option for everyone, and despite the appreciable depth that they offer, you really need to like the look for this to work for you. That isn&amp;#39;t a knock against them, as it is a matter of taste, but it is limiting all the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the rest, there is likewise a depth of options for vehicles, but for the resin printer, there is nothing that makes these stand out against other options unless they are the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; option for the particular vehicle you are looking for. For the FDM printer, they still aren&amp;#39;t exceptional, but they are definitely solid and you can be assured of a good print with little complications. And then finally terrain, again there isn&amp;#39;t much that stands out about their offerings. They make for a nice enough addition to a Kickstarter campaign, perhaps, but there isn&amp;#39;t that much they have which can&amp;#39;t be found elsewhere and nicer looking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So on the whole, 3DBreed ends up being a bit of a mixed bag. They have their obvious strengths, but there are some definite cons. As long as you like their look, they are a really strong option for building out your army, but especially outside of the mini-figures, I wouldn&amp;#39;t consider them a first stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Previous Reviews check &lt;a href=\"/r/PrintedWWII\"&gt;/r/PrintedWWII&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a selection of which are provided below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/boltaction/comments/ytcpg8/\"&gt;Madox&lt;/a&gt; - A&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/boltaction/comments/100sbwf/\"&gt;JuSM&lt;/a&gt; - A &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/boltaction/comments/107pyic/\"&gt;Arvernes&lt;/a&gt; - A &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/boltaction/comments/11i1n58/\"&gt;Wargame3D&lt;/a&gt; - A &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/r/PrintedWWII/comments/11opwy2/\"&gt;NSM&lt;/a&gt; - A &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you like these reviews and want to help me keep doing them, you can toss a buck via &lt;a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/gk_zhukov\"&gt;Ko-Fi page&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhukov\"&gt;Buymecoffee page&lt;/a&gt;.
