Like how teens are using screens more than ever and are more anxious and depressed- but that, to me, is reversed. Look at the state of the world. Kids were I am are dropping out of high school at 14 to work because there&amp;#39;s no point anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when you look at kids who get a lot of screen time, odds are they are in lower income demographics and they don&amp;#39;t have access to proper nutrition and support, no matter how much studies might compensate for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are just too many layers that contribute to how people turn out, imo. And like you said, our generation grew up obsessively engaged with screens and maybe we&amp;#39;re not okay either, but we also had a lot of corporal punishment and whatnot too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11re17s", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ScienceBasedParenting/comments/11re17s/what_defines_screen_time_why_is_it_bad_and_where/jc8yngw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceBasedParenting/comments/11re17s/what_defines_screen_time_why_is_it_bad_and_where/", "name": "t1_jc8yngw", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ScienceBasedParenting", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678850803.0, "created_utc": 1678850803.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceBasedParenting/comments/11re17s/what_defines_screen_time_why_is_it_bad_and_where/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ugo7", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "/r/MechanicalKeyboards Ask ANY question, get an answer (March 08, 2023)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "MechanicalKeyboards", "link_author": "AutoModerator", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbhe84e", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "snowboo", "num_comments": 474, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11lqb3n", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_emlb7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Epomaker TH80 SE: is there a way to shut off/change the LED under the Epomaker logo?
