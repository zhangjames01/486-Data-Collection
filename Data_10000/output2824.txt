That may be cyber-bullying (even if you are not a student).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What Is Cyberbullying&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laws and Sanctions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All states have laws requiring schools to respond to bullying. As cyberbullying has become more prevalent with the use of technology, many states now include cyberbullying, or mention cyberbullying offenses, under these laws. Schools may take action either as required by law, or with local or school policies that allow them to discipline or take other action. Some states also have provisions to address bullying if it affects school performance. You can learn about the laws and policies in each state, including if they cover cyberbullying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it\"&gt;https://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were you I would talk with my parents about going with them to school to make a cyberbullying complaint. I would especially mention any impact this has had on my ability to enjoy school and how it may limit my ability to effectively participate in class or other educational opportunities because I&amp;#39;m fearful of further bullying or harassment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many schools may have de-facto misandrist policies or environments that fail to respect the equal rights of boys and men to cyberbullying protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is important that you document, document, document.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Document instances of bias.
