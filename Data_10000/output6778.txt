My mother is an alcoholic, and like you I have grown up watching her get blind drunk at home, make awful life choices but to everyone else she appears alright. \n\nIt's a heavy burden, but it's not one that should fall on the shoulders and mind of any child, ever.\n\nYou haven't done anything wrong. You need to remember she is in the wrong. Yes she has an addiction, but she also has a choice as to how that addiction will shape her life. She is allowing it to control her and is therefore allowing all of her awful behaviour. \n\nFrankly, your father should have stepped up a long time ago and made decisions to protect you and himself from her self-destructive behaviour. \n\nYou're 17 now, so hopefully this will mean you won't have too much longer at home and you might be going off to uni. Take the space and time. Put boundaries in place. It took me far too long to do that myself, and I am now completely no contact but my life is so much better for it. Also remember alcoholism in a parent greatly increases the likelihood of you having an issue with alcohol yourself. Be aware of that, and make the choices you need. \n\nIn my experience alcoholics are also great narcissists.
