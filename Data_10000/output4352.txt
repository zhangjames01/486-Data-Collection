seem to make those choices based on what works best for them personally.  Again, in the context where the bengkung belly bind originated, it was being worn by women in postpartum confinement so leaving the house at all was a nonissue.  I will be giving birth in December in a cold climate, and am being quite vigilant about covid safety and don't anticipate the need to do so changing much before maybe late spring of next year, so personally I don't anticipate going out a whole lot during the first couple of months postpartum.

I make approximately the average salary for 38-year-olds in the United States.\n\n**Do you own your own home or have savings/a plan for the future?**\n\nMy spouse and I own about 12% of our four bedroom house with a 30-year mortgage.

Major air trips of my twenties were Greece, Iceland, and Hawaii.  Also took some fairly major US road trips.  Inability to travel is by far my least favorite part about the pandemic.\n\n**Do you have kids?**\n\nCurrently pregnant with first.\n\n**What is something you have yet to do?**\n\nThese days it seems like most stuff to be honest.  Preparing to be a parent has definitely given a new appearance to the next couple of decades.  I'm probably going to be leaving my job after having this baby and would like to homeschool my kids when they're school aged.  The next couple of years we're going to be playing a lot by ear: will me not working be worth the tradeoffs?  Will certain freelance options I have at the moment stay viable?  Will we want to have more kids pretty promptly or wait?  We may want to move again someday for a change of scenery, career advancement, or to be closer to family.  My parents are in their sixties now and them getting older will inevitably play a role in the future.  I'd like to write a book.  I'd like to own a business of some kind.  I'd like to invest in property besides our current home and build some extra wealth to enjoy.  There's a lot of places I'd still like to visit.  We'll see what the future actually holds.\n\n**Do you have a consistent hobby or hobbies you love?**\n\nI write a lot, though since I finished my most recent novel manuscript earlier this year I've taken a little bit of a break from consistent daily work in that department.  Our 100-year old house keeps me pretty busy with renovation projects.  Cooking, witchcraft, and reading are pretty consistent, painting and knitting more seasonal in the winter months when I'm very indoors.  I'm fairly outdoorsy when the weather is warm.  I collect stuff.  I love to throw parties in a non-pandemic world.\n\n**What legacy do you hope to leave to the world?**\n\nI'd like to be remembered as an interesting person who helped others see the world a bit differently than maybe they otherwise would have.

The next couple of years we&amp;#39;re going to be playing a lot by ear: will me not working be worth the tradeoffs?  Will certain freelance options I have at the moment stay viable?  Will we want to have more kids pretty promptly or wait?  We may want to move again someday for a change of scenery, career advancement, or to be closer to family.  My parents are in their sixties now and them getting older will inevitably play a role in the future.  I&amp;#39;d like to write a book.  I&amp;#39;d like to own a business of some kind.  I&amp;#39;d like to invest in property besides our current home and build some extra wealth to enjoy.  There&amp;#39;s a lot of places I&amp;#39;d still like to visit.  We&amp;#39;ll see what the future actually holds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a consistent hobby or hobbies you love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I write a lot, though since I finished my most recent novel manuscript earlier this year I&amp;#39;ve taken a little bit of a break from consistent daily work in that department.  Our 100-year old house keeps me pretty busy with renovation projects.  Cooking, witchcraft, and reading are pretty consistent, painting and knitting more seasonal in the winter months when I&amp;#39;m very indoors.  I&amp;#39;m fairly outdoorsy when the weather is warm.  I collect stuff.  I love to throw parties in a non-pandemic world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What legacy do you hope to leave to the world?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to be remembered as an interesting person who helped others see the world a bit differently than maybe they otherwise would have.  Writing something widely read would probably be the most grandiose extension of this legacy I would aspire to, but I think I&amp;#39;ll be fine if my legacy is confined to a few of the luckier people who crossed my path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_hscixs", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/INTP/comments/hscixs/30_intps_whats_your_life_like/fy9y8zh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/hscixs/30_intps_whats_your_life_like/", "name": "t1_fy9y8zh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/INTP", "author_flair_text": "INTP", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1594922744.0, "created_utc": 1594922744.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/hscixs/30_intps_whats_your_life_like/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvl", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Any older INTPs with or without kids?

You might want to think about talking with a therapist about the ways this attachment style is negatively impacting your ability to form the kinds of romantic relationships you would prefer to be having.  It's entirely plausible that on some level your avoidant attachment tendencies are motivating you to self-sabotage opportunities for closer romantic relationships.  Meeting up with guys who ask you out because they think your whole deal is \"sex positivity\" and then withholding all the deeper more interesting components of who you are is an effective recipe to prevent developing the sort of close, vulnerable relationship that most people are looking for in a romantic partnership.  There is also a self-protective element to this recipe, in that by never revealing yourself fully to the person you're dating, you never have to worry about their potential rejection feeling very personal.  Of course you can't be expected to fully reveal who you are to someone on the first couple of dates, but most people can tell intuitively when the person they're talking to is deliberately holding back a lot, and most people (except perhaps other avoidantly attached people who struggle with intimacy) tend to interpret that withholding tendency somewhere on the spectrum from overly-guarded to hostile.  Having your guard up around people trying to get to know you is implicitly a type of rejection.  You are essentially rejecting their efforts to get to know you.  Unfortunately, it is often (not always, but often) people with somewhat malicious or abusive tendencies who are both insensitive to rejection and motivated enough to break down the walls of an obviously guarded and untrusting person.

Neither have been polished to a level where I think I could get them published and I have a lot of hangups about the idea of self-publishing my own fiction, but if you're just looking for some ways an INTP has managed to get a book-length story written in the first place here are a few things that were useful for me:\n\n1. Reading a lot more than I usually do and usually shorter stuff.  I would guess typically I average about 2-4 books a year and usually at least one of those is a 700+ page doorstop.  When I'm writing I find it helpful to chew through more like 12-15 books a year (which means most of those need to be shorter than 500 pages).  Constantly being engaged in a piece of fiction just keeps your mind working in a sort of fictional-narrative form, which I find cuts down on the challenge of choosing the \"right\" scene to progress the story forward.  Scenes present themselves more naturally when I'm in this mindset.  Short story collections are also really helpful to read because you can start to identify different writers' tricks and patterns when you consume a bunch of their work in quick succession.\n2. Having a divided structure to the story that creates milestones within the writing process.  I find writing from multiple points of view much easier than maintaining one main character's perspective (I've never successfully done the latter).  My more recent manuscript was specifically divided into 8 parts told from 4 points of view with each major character getting 2 50-page sections.  Part of this I justified in my head as philosophically relevant to the story--I wanted to present male and female perspectives equally and give each major character's subjective experience equal real estate in the story.  But mainly it was just a very helpful writing tool since previous failed efforts at novels had often stalled around the 50-80 page mark.  Since I knew I could write roughly 50 page chunks it made sense to divide the novel into sections of that length and string them together.  Each time a section ended it felt a little bit like I got to start from \"scratch\" with the next character.\n3. Daily word count.  This is how I actually \"get it done.\"  My first manuscript I somehow managed to barf out 2,000 words a week day pretty consistently and got the manuscript written in 4 months.  It is also very bad.  The second manuscript I held myself to a 100-word a week day minimum, but almost always exceeded that.  It took me about a year and is a lot less bad (though it still has a lot of problems).  Internalize the notion that not meeting your word count is 10000% more shameful than writing something you don't feel great about.  Shame yourself when you don't do the work, even when you didn't feel like it.  In my experience the stuff you write while under a burst of flow-like inspiration is no more consistently good than the stuff you force onto the page out of your mentally constipated fingers anyway.\n4. Watching famous author interviews constantly.  This may feed into one's own grandiosity when you hear famous authors tell charlie rose or interviewers at the new yorker festival the sorts of things about writing that you yourself have thought at times, but I find the insights famous authors have about their writing processes useful to immerse myself in.  It normalizes the idea that writing is both difficult and an actual job for some people--not just an artistic burst of inspiration that results in an object anyone literate can produce.\n5. Developing patience.  This is the one I struggle with the most to be honest.  I hate that I can spend a full year working regularly at something and have it just not be there yet.  I hate facing the reality that I can legitimately try damn hard at something and it truly not be awesome right away.  INTP's really love to preserve the illusion that the only thing holding us back from exceptionalism is our own laziness.  The fact is, once you start trying pretty hard at something and the results turn out shitty, the next step is gaining experience tolerating that.  I honestly don't really know where I'm at with my second manuscript.  I like enough things about it that I hate to just let it totally disappear, but after the year I spent writing it, I was pretty burned out and wasn't really able to reread it well enough to edit without all the original thinking behind the draft clouding my head.  Maybe at the end of this year I'll have the headspace to look at it with fresh eyes and fix what needs fixing, or maybe at the end of this year I'll look at it and it will seem even worse than it did when I finished it.  Ultimately I just need to wait and see.  The desire for results can be both motivating and totally discouraging.  It's motivating when you haven't done much and need to get started, but it gets more discouraging when you've done a lot already and you're still so far away.

My parents had alienated me profoundly enough at that stage that it was a total nonstarter to imagine moving home after graduation.  I started working as a full time receptionist at a local architecture firm in my college town immediately after graduating, moved up into their marketing department within 4 months, moved across the country and got married two years later.  I was 24, just got back from my honeymoon in Greece, nabbed what felt (at the time) like a lucrative day job in my new big city, and started sending short stories to The New Yorker, Harpers, and Granta.  This was when the exceptional part of my life was supposed to start.\n\nHarper's actually sent me a polite complimentary rejection note scrawled in pen on my self-addressed read receipt, but alas, my experience-free intellectual artistic genius went unpublished.  My colleagues at the lucrative day job consisted of mainly construction workers from the deep south.  My giant new city made me panicky and anxious.  We didn't know a single person there.  I became convinced I wasn't made for this world--that my intelligence and sensitivity and neuroticism and lack of interest in STEM meant I would never thrive in the world of normal sheeple.  My exit strategy of prodigiously writing my way out of that world had failed.  The fantasyland where constant, minimally challenging artistic and intellectual accomplishments would provide a high quality of life, regular travel opportunities, social admiration, and a sense of meaning had been atomically bombed.  I quit my job and devoted myself to full time depression naps and severe suicidal ideation while our basic expenses exceeded my husband's single entry-level income and slowly hollowed us into extra debt.  My husband took me to the psych ward a few weeks before I turned 25.\n\nFour months later I had a great therapist, a couple local friends, and a new job, again, doing marketing for an architecture firm.  Five years later, I still hold that job in a full time work from home capacity, and make a wildly inflated urban salary living in a painfully charming, highly affordable rural town in the upper midwest.  I am friends with my boss.  My husband is the best person I know.  I have the best relationship with my parents that I've ever had.  My house is fucking gorgeous.  My golden retriever is fucking adorable.  My giant orange cat is fucking hilarious.  I'm 26 pages away from finishing a maybe publishable 400-page novel manuscript, and I submitted my first short story to the Kenyon Review two days ago.  I applied to, and was rejected from, four creative writing MFA programs last year and cried about it once or twice, but otherwise lost zero sleep over it.  I'm trying to have a baby.  We're going to Hawaii next week.\n\nBasically, a gigantic cocoon of self-induced trauma wised me up to how lucky, delusionally arrogant, and relatively exceptional I already was.  A comfortable life surrounded by good people is not normal or banal.  It's rare as hell and should be treasured as such.  I think what really drove this home for me was realizing how morally abhorrent, contemptuous, and judgmental it is to look out at all the people trying their best in this world--people with dreams, talents, and rich inner lives just as real and legitimate as mine--and thinking I, for some unknown reason, needed and deserved a more remarkable existence than any of them.  Basically, I realized that holding irrationally high standards for the worth of one's own life is a grossly narcissistic and misanthropic thing to do, and the deep shame of discovering how insanely self-absorbed was like flipping a switch that activated some direly necessary self-compassion.  I didn't have to earn the right to feel proud of myself by being better or smarter than normal people.\n\nQuestions like this one are a recurring theme I've seen over the years on r/INTP and they are almost always posed by young adults whose parents are still supporting them economically.  I can only assume this demographic is uniquely oblivious to the enormous amount of time and energy (at a desk job or otherwise) that it takes to secure the stuff of our most basic human needs.  Enjoying your parents' high standard of living without a scrap of time spent personally obtaining it probably does make it seem pretty meaningless.  I suspect the 35 years worth of discipline and labor that it took to build everything you take for granted gives your dad's life quite a bit of meaning, but it understandably doesn't feel all that special to someone who has enjoyed it for free from birth.\n\nDiscipline and labor are wildly underrated by INTP's because many of us learn to succeed without them when we're young.  But for those who are not independently wealthy, discipline and labor are by far the most reliable tools for securing one of the things people value most:  personal autonomy.  Perhaps you will be the luckiest person alive and will manage to grasp a sense of control over your destiny without ever having to try very hard at anything, but it seems far more likely that forgoing labor and discipline will lead to the common depressing outcome of feeling empty and adrift, subject to the indignity of the whims of the world dictating one's life.\n\n**TLDR:**  **Was once young with delusions of grandeur.

I applied to, and was rejected from, four creative writing MFA programs last year and cried about it once or twice, but otherwise lost zero sleep over it.  I&amp;#39;m trying to have a baby.  We&amp;#39;re going to Hawaii next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, a gigantic cocoon of self-induced trauma wised me up to how lucky, delusionally arrogant, and relatively exceptional I already was.  A comfortable life surrounded by good people is not normal or banal.  It&amp;#39;s rare as hell and should be treasured as such.  I think what really drove this home for me was realizing how morally abhorrent, contemptuous, and judgmental it is to look out at all the people trying their best in this world--people with dreams, talents, and rich inner lives just as real and legitimate as mine--and thinking I, for some unknown reason, needed and deserved a more remarkable existence than any of them.  Basically, I realized that holding irrationally high standards for the worth of one&amp;#39;s own life is a grossly narcissistic and misanthropic thing to do, and the deep shame of discovering how insanely self-absorbed was like flipping a switch that activated some direly necessary self-compassion.  I didn&amp;#39;t have to earn the right to feel proud of myself by being better or smarter than normal people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Questions like this one are a recurring theme I&amp;#39;ve seen over the years on &lt;a href=\"/r/INTP\"&gt;r/INTP&lt;/a&gt; and they are almost always posed by young adults whose parents are still supporting them economically.  I can only assume this demographic is uniquely oblivious to the enormous amount of time and energy (at a desk job or otherwise) that it takes to secure the stuff of our most basic human needs.  Enjoying your parents&amp;#39; high standard of living without a scrap of time spent personally obtaining it probably does make it seem pretty meaningless.  I suspect the 35 years worth of discipline and labor that it took to build everything you take for granted gives your dad&amp;#39;s life quite a bit of meaning, but it understandably doesn&amp;#39;t feel all that special to someone who has enjoyed it for free from birth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Discipline and labor are wildly underrated by INTP&amp;#39;s because many of us learn to succeed without them when we&amp;#39;re young.  But for those who are not independently wealthy, discipline and labor are by far the most reliable tools for securing one of the things people value most:  personal autonomy.  Perhaps you will be the luckiest person alive and will manage to grasp a sense of control over your destiny without ever having to try very hard at anything, but it seems far more likely that forgoing labor and discipline will lead to the common depressing outcome of feeling empty and adrift, subject to the indignity of the whims of the world dictating one&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Was once young with delusions of grandeur.  Avoided suicide by productively shaming myself (alongside other essential treatment).  Am now quite happy materially, mentally, and creatively despite my fairly banal-looking life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_ejck9t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/INTP/comments/ejck9t/banality_of_a_normal_life/fcyffu7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/ejck9t/banality_of_a_normal_life/", "name": "t1_fcyffu7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/INTP", "author_flair_text": "INTP", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1578079275.0, "created_utc": 1578079275.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/ejck9t/banality_of_a_normal_life/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvl", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What you usually do when you hangout with your friends?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "INTP", "link_author": "heha2468", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fcxoruw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dunnoyabassa", "num_comments": 4, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ejf0x0", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_cxfw9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Friends:  Eat, drink, and talk mostly.

You're both obviously going through an enormously stressful time in your lives and therapy can be an extremely helpful temporary resource to keep understandably extreme reactions to huge external pressures from warping our frame of mind into something out of hand.  I know that can probably seem like an enormous extra burden to take on, but it's not--having a therapist during a crisis is like paying someone to keep the crisis mentally manageable.\n\nIf that's a nonstarter, though, you can help by being your husband's emotional translator.  Instead of asking him what's wrong, or making his emotional outbursts something for which he has to answer to you, observe what he's feeling and calmly, kindly, non-judgmentally explain to him what you're seeing.  Reassure him it is okay to feel the way he feels--he's going through a lot--and ask if he has any ideas for how you can make what he's going through easier.  An example would be:\n\nHusband: *Slams door and gripes about how the adoption lawyer is demanding one more goddamn thing!*\n\nYou:  I can see that you're angry, and I get why you're frustrated.  That goddamn adoption lawyer keeps demanding thing after thing when we're already so stretched trying to keep it together during Billy's surgeries.  You have every right to be mad.  This is a nightmare!  I love and appreciate how much you've already been willing to do to get through this.  Is there something I can help with to get the lawyer what he needs?\n\nThe reason a therapist is highly recommended is because it's often hard and feels unfair to help someone process their own feelings while you have so many of your own feelings and experiences wrapped up in their behavior.  You might feel like you're already doing so much, how are you supposed to take on more things to help your husband when you're stretched so thin yourself?  You might resent feeling like you're stuck having to manage his emotions for him while he's yelling like an asshole at you.  Therapists, who have no personal stake in you or your husbands troubles can be very useful to remind both of you that you each have a right to feel what you feel, which can be a hard thing to reconcile when you feel like you're at odds.\n\nIt sounds like you want to be on the same team.

An example would be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Husband: &lt;em&gt;Slams door and gripes about how the adoption lawyer is demanding one more goddamn thing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You:  I can see that you&amp;#39;re angry, and I get why you&amp;#39;re frustrated.  That goddamn adoption lawyer keeps demanding thing after thing when we&amp;#39;re already so stretched trying to keep it together during Billy&amp;#39;s surgeries.  You have every right to be mad.  This is a nightmare!  I love and appreciate how much you&amp;#39;ve already been willing to do to get through this.  Is there something I can help with to get the lawyer what he needs?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason a therapist is highly recommended is because it&amp;#39;s often hard and feels unfair to help someone process their own feelings while you have so many of your own feelings and experiences wrapped up in their behavior.  You might feel like you&amp;#39;re already doing so much, how are you supposed to take on more things to help your husband when you&amp;#39;re stretched so thin yourself?  You might resent feeling like you&amp;#39;re stuck having to manage his emotions for him while he&amp;#39;s yelling like an asshole at you.  Therapists, who have no personal stake in you or your husbands troubles can be very useful to remind both of you that you each have a right to feel what you feel, which can be a hard thing to reconcile when you feel like you&amp;#39;re at odds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you want to be on the same team.  This difficult time in your life is temporary.  I wish you both the best.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_dsmxg4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/INTP/comments/dsmxg4/need_some_advice_with_my_intp_husband/f6qlq3h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/dsmxg4/need_some_advice_with_my_intp_husband/", "name": "t1_f6qlq3h", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/INTP", "author_flair_text": "INTP", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1573080101.0, "created_utc": 1573080101.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/dsmxg4/need_some_advice_with_my_intp_husband/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvl", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Everything is a cope (long post so read at your own expense)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "INTP", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f5y0ocs", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dunnoyabassa", "num_comments": 4, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_f5xxiew", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_cxfw9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sometimes you also don't get what you want, but life turns out okay anyway.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "NT", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you also don&amp;#39;t get what you want, but life turns out okay anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_dpizy3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/INTP/comments/dpizy3/everything_is_a_cope_long_post_so_read_at_your/f5y0ocs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/dpizy3/everything_is_a_cope_long_post_so_read_at_your/", "name": "t1_f5y0ocs", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/INTP", "author_flair_text": "INTP", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1572549079.0, "created_utc": 1572549079.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/dpizy3/everything_is_a_cope_long_post_so_read_at_your/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhvl", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Everything is a cope (long post so read at your own expense)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "INTP", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "f5x2zdw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dunnoyabassa", "num_comments": 4, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_dpizy3", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_cxfw9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "There's some valid stuff in here, but you digress pretty quickly into what sounds like your version of coping with the stress of unpredictable situations and uncertainty, which is faith that this \"theory of everything\" you've cobbled together here will provide a reliable framework to help you achieve ongoing success in business, love, and life in general.
