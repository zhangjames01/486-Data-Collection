The model idea is interesting, though. My dad actually has several models of older aircraft that he has displayed on a counter at his pharmacy. I think I might try to find something similar to complement the ones he already has. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mom is all set on cookware, but I think you may be onto something with the cookware for my younger brother. Looking back to my college years (in the not too distant past haha) I didn&amp;#39;t have any decent cookware. Now that I&amp;#39;m older with a decent career and a lot more financially stable, it&amp;#39;s incredible how big a difference some quality cookware and utensils can make. I may check out a nice set of pots/pans for him or maybe a few decent knives.
