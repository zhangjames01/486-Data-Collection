Their stated position is different from their actual position. Most conservatives are not aware of their actual position in the same way that gay republicans who \"got reformed\" aren't aware that their homosexuality is a part of themselves and they think it's just a demon or some nonsense.\n\nConservatives (the average one in this country anyway) ACTUALLY believe that the poor should serve as an underclass to be exploited by the rich. Their moral compass tells them that some people are \"better\" and some are \"worse\" and that people DESERVE their positions in life. This morality is actually a structure of a developmental level in human consciousness. We saw it in Europe in the middle ages and we see it in India now with the caste system. It's just a phase of human development where the morality is that better people get more and worse people get less.\n\nExtracting from that moral position, it's not hard to see why republicans treate fetuses as sacred and treat poor children like garbage -- There is no actual inconsistency here.
