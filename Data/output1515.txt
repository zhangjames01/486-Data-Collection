As someone who is disabled, and who has a family member with a mental disability, I cannot tell you just how mad it makes me that someone would risk letting a potentially healthy baby be born any other way. Being disabled, for all the flowery stories about how it made people stronger/better/whatever, sucks. She&amp;#39;s not just delusional, she&amp;#39;s selfish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plenty of women find themselves pregnant and gain the courage to stop doing harmful things (quitting smoking, alcohol, drugs, treating their eating disorders) for the sake of their future child. That&amp;#39;s just part of being a responsible mother. Press the fact that if she really loves this baby, she should do everything in her power to make sure it comes out healthy. At least that way, this new life she&amp;#39;s creating will have a better chance of making it on its own, regardless of whether or not the mother is able to care for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1ix09n", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ix09n/physically_unhealthy_friend_of_mine_was_raped/cb8z2ff/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ix09n/physically_unhealthy_friend_of_mine_was_raped/", "name": "t1_cb8z2ff", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1374631786.0, "created_utc": 1374631786.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ix09n/physically_unhealthy_friend_of_mine_was_raped/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "First tourists arrested in Russia for \u2018gay propaganda\u2019", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 7, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "worldnews", "link_author": "australopathetic", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cb88gy1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "omg_mangos", "num_comments": 224, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cb84fat", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_ajbdh", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I have a sneaking suspicion that gay Russians probably give a shit.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a sneaking suspicion that gay Russians probably give a shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1it5h5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/1it5h5/first_tourists_arrested_in_russia_for_gay/cb88gy1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1it5h5/first_tourists_arrested_in_russia_for_gay/", "name": "t1_cb88gy1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1374544043.0, "created_utc": 1374544043.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/first-tourists-arrested-russia-%E2%80%98gay-propaganda%E2%80%99220713"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Desk workers of reddit -
