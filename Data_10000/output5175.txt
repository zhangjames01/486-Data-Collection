Long-term, he might want to figure out why he\u2019s not having fun when that happens, and either avoid the games that include that as an option, or possibly just avoid multiplayer gaming entirely.

It might be a problem if that\u2019s not the sort of game the rest of the group likes, but that\u2019s an easier problem to tackle. Some people just really like shorter games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) If being in a bad position stresses him out to the point of the game not being fun, provide a eject button. With 1830 specifically, it\u2019s not too difficult to automate a player to have minimal impact to the other players. If he\u2019s not having fun, letting him escape might be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) It might be a good idea to talk with him one on one and take a few steps back. If board games cause stress\u2026why is he playing them? There\u2019s a very real possibility he\u2019s playing for a social context rather than actually enjoying games as a whole. If that\u2019s the problem, these problems will fester regardless of what the colors and shapes of the cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, your friend doesn\u2019t sound like an extreme kingmaker offender. It seems like for them the game is no longer fun and they want a way out (perhaps while still participating socially). Short term, give him that option and see if he takes it. Long-term, he might want to figure out why he\u2019s not having fun when that happens, and either avoid the games that include that as an option, or possibly just avoid multiplayer gaming entirely. That might not make things easier to solve the problem, but it does make them less personal, which removes the social tension and allows for more rational decisions to be made.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_ts12fy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/boardgames/comments/ts12fy/kingmaker_resilient_board_games/i2p90de/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ts12fy/kingmaker_resilient_board_games/", "name": "t1_i2p90de", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boardgames", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1648638923.0, "created_utc": 1648638923.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ts12fy/kingmaker_resilient_board_games/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm21", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The more money you have the cheaper things are.
