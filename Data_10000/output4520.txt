Try to avoid them if you can. I like to save them up to auto lower range adc&amp;#39;s when they go up to cs and it usually will do a decent amount of damage. Since Thresh&amp;#39;s like to go relic shield, this does mean that every time he tries to proc a relic shield, he loses the auto bonus and will do much less trade damage for a decent period of time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, if running a sustain/ poke lane, if you can survive/not lose early Thresh becomes much easier to manage. The best case I can think of this is Nami, because after a few levels in her w Nami will outtrade Thresh in general and if you can dodge or survive the initial hook burst, you can just outpoke and outsustain thresh down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_376v6s", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/leagueoflegends/comments/376v6s/name_a_champion_you_have_problems_playing_against/crkwtmi/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/376v6s/name_a_champion_you_have_problems_playing_against/", "name": "t1_crkwtmi", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1432606728.0, "created_utc": 1432606728.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/376v6s/name_a_champion_you_have_problems_playing_against/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Champion Suggestion Bot: Tell me your summoner name and I'll suggest some champions you may want to play!", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "link_author": "sufficiency", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cqn0upe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "halonjuice", "num_comments": 22642, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_33o6nf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_42aai", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "championsuggest: na cg halonjuice", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "velkoz", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;championsuggest: na cg halonjuice&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_33o6nf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/leagueoflegends/comments/33o6nf/champion_suggestion_bot_tell_me_your_summoner/cqn0upe/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/33o6nf/champion_suggestion_bot_tell_me_your_summoner/", "name": "t1_cqn0upe", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1429870642.0, "created_utc": 1429870642.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/33o6nf/champion_suggestion_bot_tell_me_your_summoner/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Name a Champion you have problems playing against.

All Morgana has to do is spellshield whoever Leona E's on and Leona can't do much to that person anymore. \n\nThresh, while not quite as big an annoyance as Morgana, can (depending on how good he is) flay Leona's e, effectively denying and stopping Leona's gapcloser and prevent Leona from getting close enough to do anything else. This of course gets a bit better at lvl 6 when Leona gets ult.\n\nZyra has been nerfed a good amount from before. She's still an amazing counter-engager with her ult but she is very squishy and dies if caught by pretty much anything. She does offer good poke though, still.\n\nAnnie support has been nerfed considerably since her glory days. Her passive stun now scales with levels (so it is weaker and stuns for much less at early levels) and the base damage of all her damage abilities have been lowered but she has better scaling (to weaken Annie support and strengthen Ap carry Annie). As a result, Annie is much less of a dominant early-mid game support.\n\nI am not an AD main so the ADC stuff is just what I've observed/ believe\n\nI actually see some Ezreals still and a few Graves every now and then.

I actually don't think Graves is that bad, he's kind of like a different Lucian.

With the safety/utility of Lucian and the pressure/assassination potential from Twitch, I assume Graves is just less useful.\n\nLucian is incredibly dominant early game and a great duelist/trader. A good Lucian can make a lot happen and he can still do damage from pretty far away with his ult. Lucian has an annoying amount of safety with his dash and the range of his ult. Twitch is pretty much an adc assassin that creates pressure when he can't be seen. He pops out of nowhere and bursts a squishy down with his ambush bonus, botrk, and ult. Most other ad carries lose pressure when they can't be seen on the map, but twitch actually gains pressure as long as he keeps making himself felt in the game.\n\nAs for Ryze, he is usually played top lane as a counter to most top laners because Ryze is really good at punshing and zoning most melee top laners (and guess what kind of top laners are popular right now). As a bonus he'll also usually end up scaling to lategame better than his top counterpart as well.\n\ntldr: Morgana and Thresh beat Leona. Leona goes in, can't come out.
