Repeating weeks happens sometimes. I&amp;#39;ve seen people saying they felt like they were dying even though they completed a week so they went back to run 1 or run 2 in that week to build up some more fitness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ultimately remember the sayings about how it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how long it takes someone to run 5K/10K/a marathon, you still ran the same distance as someone much faster (or slower) than you. Increasing your speed is one of the last things a new runner needs to be bothered about, and there&amp;#39;s no rule saying you ever need to be bothered about it (unless you want to set a goal) to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11qguv4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/C25K/comments/11qguv4/question_for_heavier_runners_repeat_weeks_or_run/jc44lx3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/11qguv4/question_for_heavier_runners_repeat_weeks_or_run/", "name": "t1_jc44lx3", "author_flair_template_id": "b88de256-fb39-11e0-a5e7-12313b0888e1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/C25K", "author_flair_text": "DONE!", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678745561.0, "created_utc": 1678745561.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/11qguv4/question_for_heavier_runners_repeat_weeks_or_run/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sekm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The Free Market Has Spoken", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 48, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TrollXChromosomes", "link_author": "Nicoletta_Al-Kaysani", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbzs1tb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "SupervillainIndiana", "num_comments": 66, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbzr8ml", "score": 48, "author_fullname": "t2_j2s03", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sadly I think you're right because I see so much that makes me wonder if a lot of men who are apparently attracted to women actually *like* women. \n\nFortunately I have plenty of examples in my life where I know that there are men who want a deep, loving and trusting relationship and fun times hanging out every day with a woman who trusts and loves you completely too and wants to hang out every day.
