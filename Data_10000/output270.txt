You can get that all by level 13, so early enough to be used against the boss. When Line Guard's maxed, you can grab stuff like Antivolt/cold/fire and put more in Guardian/bodyguard. \n\nG -&gt; if you're using Dark Ether, just pick a sword skill and cap it. Endless battle is 25% more damage on your attacks, vs  ~430% per Blade Rave for example. As for your early points, work towards 5/10 Rush (it's a prerequisite for your better sword attacK) for the first 6 levels, and max Blade Rave after. You can cap Rave by level 23, which is around the time you're hitting 2nd stratum's boss. Then you can start grabbing Charge/Endless Battle/Berserker Vow for extra modifiers on top of blade rave.\n\nA -&gt; again, Giant Kill is 55% more damage passively on all attacks, while Front Mortar is 382% per attack. Early on, take just 1 point in one or each of the barrages (doable by level 6 if you take all 3 barrages) before rushing to front mortar. You'll have to put the Arbalist on the front row for that though, keep in mind. After getting a point in Front Mortar, you can either take it all the way to 10/10 right away, or start leveling Giant Kill first for easier random battles.\n\nP -&gt; To get Ad Nihilo, you need 5 in each Guard and Attack Order. I'd probably rush to Protect Order first, take a 1point dip in Prevent Order, then take 5 in Attack Order before I start spreading points further. Alternatively, you can sink points into the Monarch March line for free out-of-combat healing and rely more on consumables for in-battle healing. Weaker vs bosses/foes but stronger for exploration.\n\nZ -&gt; if you want, you can take 1 in each of the stars. Don't go higher early on though, you won't have the tp for it. Take 5/5 Dark Ether asap, then grab stuff like Singularity, Etheric Charge, and Ether Mastery. \n\nThe idea here is you sacrifice your Zod's elemental attacks to enable your Gladiator and Arbalist to spam out their highest-damage attacks for free. If you do Sea Battles, you can unlock a really strong limit around the 2nd stratum that your Zodiac can pop with Etheric Charge for ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE damage! \n\nThe trick to using elemental limits on a Zodiac is, you use the limit on the same turn that you use Etheric Charge for it to work. That means you can slip one in easily on the 1st round of a fight before switching to Dark Ether spam for the rest of the battle, assuming whatever you just nuked survived that first round.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to just pick a skill and max it instead of taking a bunch of weaker abilities, so I&amp;#39;d probably build the party this way:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H -&amp;gt; focus on Line Guard til it&amp;#39;s capped, and maybe put a point in Bodyguard and Guardian. You can get that all by level 13, so early enough to be used against the boss. When Line Guard&amp;#39;s maxed, you can grab stuff like Antivolt/cold/fire and put more in Guardian/bodyguard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;G -&amp;gt; if you&amp;#39;re using Dark Ether, just pick a sword skill and cap it. Endless battle is 25% more damage on your attacks, vs  ~430% per Blade Rave for example. As for your early points, work towards 5/10 Rush (it&amp;#39;s a prerequisite for your better sword attacK) for the first 6 levels, and max Blade Rave after. You can cap Rave by level 23, which is around the time you&amp;#39;re hitting 2nd stratum&amp;#39;s boss. Then you can start grabbing Charge/Endless Battle/Berserker Vow for extra modifiers on top of blade rave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A -&amp;gt; again, Giant Kill is 55% more damage passively on all attacks, while Front Mortar is 382% per attack. Early on, take just 1 point in one or each of the barrages (doable by level 6 if you take all 3 barrages) before rushing to front mortar. You&amp;#39;ll have to put the Arbalist on the front row for that though, keep in mind. After getting a point in Front Mortar, you can either take it all the way to 10/10 right away, or start leveling Giant Kill first for easier random battles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P -&amp;gt; To get Ad Nihilo, you need 5 in each Guard and Attack Order. I&amp;#39;d probably rush to Protect Order first, take a 1point dip in Prevent Order, then take 5 in Attack Order before I start spreading points further. Alternatively, you can sink points into the Monarch March line for free out-of-combat healing and rely more on consumables for in-battle healing. Weaker vs bosses/foes but stronger for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Z -&amp;gt; if you want, you can take 1 in each of the stars. Don&amp;#39;t go higher early on though, you won&amp;#39;t have the tp for it.
