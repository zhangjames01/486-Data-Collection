Have had guns to my face because of the color of my skin, due to living on the wrong side of town. Adopted. Poor as shit, can&amp;#39;t get a &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; job because I can&amp;#39;t see over a fucking cash register. My brain is slowly turning into a solid clump of useless synapses that will leave me a vegetable in 10 years &lt;em&gt;if I&amp;#39;m lucky&lt;/em&gt;. Among hundreds of other details I don&amp;#39;t feel like ruining your day with. I FEEL YOU. I know life is hard. And still, I have compassion for everyone else&amp;#39;s problems. I&amp;#39;m fantastically lucky in some ways, that I have the ability to BE here and complain about all this shit on a computer. Trust me, I want to die every day. I think about how badly I want it all the time. I would GLADLY trade this life to some kid starving in Africa, so I could kill myself without feeling guilty that there were starving kids in Africa. But I can&amp;#39;t trade, so I accept the fact that there&amp;#39;s someone out there who has led a &amp;quot;perfect life&amp;quot; who would gladly trade places with me so they wouldn&amp;#39;t feel bad for committing suicide. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am so very aware that there are people out there who have led truly charmed lives. I&amp;#39;m very jelly. But to the person who does not know true suffering, he is suffering in his own way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it were me in your shoes, how would I feel? I would feel like that person has yet to have his or her eyes opened by an actual bad day. And I hope they look back and APPRECIATE that they once thought their trivial nonsense was actually a bad day. I try never to judge people for things like that. The fact that they are ignorant to suffering isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing. I could never be unhappy that someone &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t suffer enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t like people to dwell on comparing themselves to others. OP has it bad for sure, but that&amp;#39;s no reason he should be able to judge others who he doesn&amp;#39;t think has it &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; bad. There&amp;#39;s no way for him to know what issues other people are putting up with. Beards, man.
