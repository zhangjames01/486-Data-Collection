My guess you struggle with this placement far less than you otherwise would. That does, however, require your moon to be well aspected. If there are a lot of squares or oppositions, you may struggle to tap into that energy.

Generally speaking, I find talking about the luminaries separately as rather pointless. Not because they don't do different things - they very much so do - but because the language around it requires some deeper astrological discourse to follow without falling into some common tropes. \n\nAll astrology is about light. The sun and moon are the only two sources of light in the sky (yes yes, I know that's not true but you explain the moon as reflecting the light of the sun to folks a few thousand years ago) with the other planets reflecting their light like the Earth does. Obviously modern astrology has moved away from this explanation of why these planets are so important, but in traditional astrology, this is what you get. Understanding this is really important when it comes to your question - why do some people have no affinity with their sun sign but might totally identify with their moon (the other luminary) or the ascendant (a pseudo-luminary)?\n\nWe often hear the \"super ego\" \"ego\" \"id\" parallels for the three major placements. The super ego is the ascendant - the self we aspire toward and the us we want the world to see. The sun is the ego, our wants and needs balanced by our rational mind. It is our self-interest. The moon is then the id, our impulses and basic desires. Like Freud's own breakdown, this model starts to fall apart when critically examined. \n\nRather, my research has continually found that we need to remember that all planets, even luminaries, have wants and take action. The ascendant is unique (as it's not a planet) but I'll come back to that. \n\nWhat does your sun want to do? The simplest answer is \"exist\" followed by \"shine\". The sun wants to be bright and get noticed for whatever its doing. The moon wants to move/change and react. It is the light that shifts most (quite literally over the course of two weeks) and its movement has direct impacts on the Earth. The moon is our reactive self and since our reactions are based in our emotions, it's associated with feeling. The \"inner self\" stuff came later with the moon and lunar magic being reclaimed by 20th century magical practitioners. \n\n Your sun is in your 8H where Leo is intercepted. This weakens your sun's ability to shine, especially given that you're quite young still. Your moon and mars help him out a lot, but the sun is still much happier elsewhere. His sign is also trapped within the energies of the 8H. I imagine that in times of crisis or when you're dedicating yourself to some greater purpose, your Virgo side comes out. Generally speaking, your moon is much happier than your sun and so we would expect those energies to show up more easily. Who you are changes when you're around different people, often responding to the needs of the group. You are well aware of what people need/want/prefer and are able to create that for them. Lots of nifty energy going on there. \n\nNOW for the ascendant! The ascendant is unquestionably your most important placement. It defines the houses, the signs ruling them, the chart ruler, and in some interpretations, represents us better than the moon or the sun. I tend to lean more to the ascendant having its own personality - it creates a third, \"pseudo-luminary). Of course, if you're a Leo or a Cancer rising, then it just makes one of your other luminaries extra powerful. Your ascendant makes Jupiter act like a third luminary. His placement, aspects, and personal desires will shape you as if it were your sun or moon. In this case, he takes on the attributes of Aquarius and the functions of the second house. You're distant and detached, with a very \"digital\" sense of self. There's a need to act in major ways by doing small things. You pride yourself on your progressive values and ideals. Add in the Sagittarius energy of the ascendant itself and you get the more complete picture of who you are.\n\nYou have a fairly weak sun, a strong moon, and your ascendant elevates Jupiter in Aquarius. Think more about how you are when the shit hits the fan or things start falling apart and then go back to Virgo. Are you the one who has a plan? Who approaches the issue head on?
