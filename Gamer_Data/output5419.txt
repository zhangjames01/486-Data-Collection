I improved extremely despite the fact that I wasn't as motivated for going to worlds as my teammates. Obviously i wanted to win, but seeing how much they wanted it, gave me more than enough motivation to become a stronger player and give my best.\n\nYou might be thinking, why the heck wasn't he as motivated as his teammates for Worlds, as it's a dream for every professional player? Well, the answer is simple (to me atleast).\n\nMy whole dream before 2014 was becoming a professional LoL player. When I reached that dream, or goal rather, my aims for 2014 was to become solid and confident enough to compete at that level. That was all I was looking for. I never expected I would get to worlds in my introduction to professional League of Legends.\n\nAnyhow, as we went to Taipei, the whole Svenskeren thing happened, and he got banned for the first 3 games. I want to make it clear to everyone, that no one hated or blamed him for that - also he was the one who felt the worst from all of us.\n\nWe all basically looked at it from the bright side, that it was only 3 games and not more, and that we had a sub jungler. At first i didn't think it would hit me, playing with another jungler, but it definitely did.\n\nSo lets now talk about what happened those 6 games at Worlds group stages, and what made me play as poorly as i did:\n\nI believe confidence has A LOT to do with a players performance on a big stage. So basically lack of confidence are the keywords in my whole performance, and everyone, including myself, would say i choked. No surprise.\n\nSo there are two possible reasons to which of why, made me play as i did;\n\n1. Being me, not playing with the jungler i had played with for 1 year, including almost 200 scrims in 2 weeks time in Korea.\n\n2. Being me, playing on an international stage.\n\nThe answer is obvious to me, as my confidence was at 80% in the Summer Playoffs for Worlds. My confidence was exactly at the point, of where it had to be perfect, at the time in Korea also, and there is NO way that playing against the international teams, of which I had played against for 2 weeks, or me playing on a big stage had any affect on my play whatsoever.\n\nSo to sum it all up, the whole thing with Svenskeren, kind of screwed over my confidence and therefore my performance. But as I've stated, he was never blamed or hated for this, in the team. We all tried to look at the bright side of the situation and play as well as we could, with a substitute.\nI also wish to mention that Gilius played extremely well, taken in consideration of what he got thrown into, with barely 1-2 days of practice in the team.\n\nI know it is big words for me to tell you all, that my performance at Worlds, was nowhere near the level that I was actually at, at that time. But this is also for the sake of my pride, and I want to prove everyone wrong.\n\nI have never been more motivated for Worlds, as I am now.\n\nTL;DR: The svenskeren thing hit my confidence quite hard, which made me perform extremely poorly. I have yet to prove myself internationally, and it has made me more motivated than ever.\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello guys, I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to write a statement of my performance at Worlds 2014 and I think I&amp;#39;ve expressed myself the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So first off, I wanna talk about my performance at Summer Playoffs as this leads up to the Korean bootcamp and my Worlds performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe i was at 50% of my full potential at that time, with a lot of confidence backing me up.\nAs we went to Seoul in Korea for bootcamp, I reached about 70% of my potential.
