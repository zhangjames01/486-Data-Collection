The night goes on and we all get together at one of the girl's houses and watch movies. We're talking about celebrities and blah blah and how hot so and so is, but the sheltered girl is not talking at all. I try to get her involved in the conversation and ask her which guy she liked from the movie and she got all defensive and blurts that she is a virgin and she's going to practice abstinence and she doesn't need to date until she's older.. No one is challenging her, but now whenever we talk she starts like quoting bible verses and just talking about being abstinent and pure, and my friend gets annoyed and tells her to shut the fuck up, and the sheltered girl yells back at her that she is going to hell. Awkward enough, but we don't want to keep arguing with this girl so I just put in a new movie and we move on. Well within minutes this girl is asleep and snoring and we start talking amongst ourselves about how rude she was and she must think we're such bitches or something. We're all getting really mad the more we talk about it...\n\nWell basically one thing led to another and the one girl she said was going to hell gets up and is like \"fuck it, if i'm going to hell I'm going down in flames.\" She goes and gets all this random shit from the fridge--cream cheese and pickles and relish and horseradish.. She starts smearing it all over the sheltered girl while she's sleeping. We're all laughing and taking pictures and I even contributed by adding a dill spear to her open mouth like a cigar. And I'm just laughing the whole time. Finally she woke up to see us all laughing at her and she felt her face and started screaming. She ran to the bathroom and washed up and just cried the whole night. No one talked to her to see if she was ok or anything.
