happy, be content with everything, be happy with yourself. its all about state, be happy and comfortable. like they say improvement isn't just in one aspect, and to be a good PUA you need to be happy with yourself before you find happiness with anyone else.\n\nSo simply as you work on your state of mind, be happy be the fun guy that is always having the blast, this is what people like to be around, thus makes you more attractive.\n\nI would simply recommend practice, make it habitual. talking to a shopping clerk smile, talking to mum, smile, block out the bad and just think of good, be your ideal man that you want to be, and aim for that state, then you will hopefully not feel like you are forcing the smile as much.\n\nBut i did force the smile at the start, i probably looked creepy as, but i found the more i did it, the more i talked the more happy i got because i saw progress and it all built up.\n\nLast bit, this guide works for males too, but easier because you are likely to have the same hobbies, and there is zero threat to you, because they aren't going to assume you want to hook up with them.\n\nStart on shopping clerks because heck they are paid to be nice and to talk, then start with, stranger, 1 stranger any day(thats someone that isnt paid to talk to you). that can be anything from, \"have the time?\", \"what great/shitty weather today\".\n\nStart small, start with 1 stranger a day, if you are in a good happy comfortable state its easy to talk, simply walking around see someone walking their dog, Hi. and keep walking.\n\nGood luck. get on that happy
