With all respect I don't think you have a complete understanding of how the protocol works.\n\nFirst, there's public and private keys: one key can be used to encrypt data, after which only the other key can be used to decrypt the data (and vice versa).\n\nYou can encrypt some data with a public key and nobody except the owner of the private key can decrypt it. So long as the private key is secure, the data is secure until it's decrypted.\n\nConversely, the private key can be used to encrypt data as well. Obviously, since the corresponding key is *public*, this is *not* secure - anyone in the world could decrypt it. However, that data can be *proven authentic*, because there's no way a public key can decrypt something that wasn't encrypted by the corresponding, secured, private key.\n\nThis is called \"signing\".\n\nWe can't have the public keys for every host on the Internet built into every operating system, browser, phone, etc. But we _can_ have the public keys for every _certificate authority_ built into those clients (or at least the central, public CAs).\n\nA \"certificate\" is a public key (and other metadata) for some site like reddit.com, but signed with the private key of a certificate authority (Reddit uses DigiCert). Reddit's public key can thus be obtained *and verified* by obtaining Reddit's certificate from DigiCert and decrypting it with DigiCert's public key which, again, is built into client software and not obtained over the Internet.\n\nOnce the browser has an authentic public key for reddit.com, it then generates a temporary, two-directional session key. That key is encrypted with Reddit's public key and sent to reddit.com as part of the https negotiation, and it is used to encrypt all of the subsequent traffic in the session.\n\nSo unless you can control which CA a client is using, you have no way to see the two-directional session key and thus no way to decrypt the subsequent traffic.\n\nSo there are only two ways for your firewall to reverse https:\n\n1. you create your own CA and force every client on your network to use it while providing its public key to your firewall, or\n2. you somehow have the private keys of all the CAs that various sites like reddit use (which you almost certainly don't).\n\nOtherwise any router on the Internet (including e.g. TOR exit nodes, etc.) could then be used to steal site logins, banking credentials, forge traffic, hack into any site, etc. The security of the Internet would be entirely compromised.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CA is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; relevant.

However, that data can be &lt;em&gt;proven authentic&lt;/em&gt;, because there&amp;#39;s no way a public key can decrypt something that wasn&amp;#39;t encrypted by the corresponding, secured, private key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is called &amp;quot;signing&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t have the public keys for every host on the Internet built into every operating system, browser, phone, etc. But we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have the public keys for every &lt;em&gt;certificate authority&lt;/em&gt; built into those clients (or at least the central, public CAs).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;certificate&amp;quot; is a public key (and other metadata) for some site like reddit.com, but signed with the private key of a certificate authority (Reddit uses DigiCert). Reddit&amp;#39;s public key can thus be obtained &lt;em&gt;and verified&lt;/em&gt; by obtaining Reddit&amp;#39;s certificate from DigiCert and decrypting it with DigiCert&amp;#39;s public key which, again, is built into client software and not obtained over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the browser has an authentic public key for reddit.com, it then generates a temporary, two-directional session key. That key is encrypted with Reddit&amp;#39;s public key and sent to reddit.com as part of the https negotiation, and it is used to encrypt all of the subsequent traffic in the session.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So unless you can control which CA a client is using, you have no way to see the two-directional session key and thus no way to decrypt the subsequent traffic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there are only two ways for your firewall to reverse https:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;you create your own CA and force every client on your network to use it while providing its public key to your firewall, or&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;you somehow have the private keys of all the CAs that various sites like reddit use (which you almost certainly don&amp;#39;t).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise any router on the Internet (including e.g. TOR exit nodes, etc.) could then be used to steal site logins, banking credentials, forge traffic, hack into any site, etc. The security of the Internet would be entirely compromised.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_101t97l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/privacy/comments/101t97l/what_can_the_government_legally_see_from_your/j2zanz6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/101t97l/what_can_the_government_legally_see_from_your/", "name": "t1_j2zanz6", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/privacy", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1672876580.0, "created_utc": 1672876580.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/101t97l/what_can_the_government_legally_see_from_your/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlc", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What can the government legally see from your Internet usage?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "privacy", "link_author": "Berabouman", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j2y2ywy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ToneWashed", "num_comments": 140, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j2xwopy", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_c96fi", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right, so an org that runs its own certificate authority and forces all clients on their network (like browsers) to use that internal CA instead of a public one could certainly compromise https.
