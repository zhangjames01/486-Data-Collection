I felt this. I've been in therapy for close to a year and I did no contact for 6 months. Started talking again because I still wanted them in my life, even if it was just in a friend's capacity. Go figure- that was a bad idea. We will talk randomly but nothing really of substance. Most of the time they take a day or so to respond so I know they don't care about me anymore. But whatever, sometimes people's lives get busy and I don't stress over other friends taking their time to respond to me. (Most of my friends have kids, nbd) About a week ago the possibility of getting back together came up organically and they left me with bread crumbs. \"I can't see the future, I'm not a seer.\" Had a day of hope, had a day sadness, kept moving along with life. Then over the weekend I had to be admitted to the ER (I'm fine) and I posted a photo to my Snapchat story about it. The person I fell in love with would have immediately messaged me to check in. I know they saw it and elected to say nothing. They aren't my person anymore but it is hard to ignore the way they made you feel in the past.
