I'm also pretty tall (over 6') so I guess I'm luckier than some, but from my perspective that just makes me stand out that much more. I lost about 70 pounds when I was 14 and that was pretty much the thinnest I've ever been, ~215 pounds, and a size 14. Now i'm in my early 20s and hover around 300 pounds. \n\nBeing a fat girl sucks. I've *never* been able to shop at all the \"cute\" stores - Abercrombie, Hollister, Aeropostale, American Eagle..all those places that seem like such a big deal when you're in junior high and high school. I go out shopping with my (thinner) friends and all I can think about is oh, how cute that would be if I was 150 pounds thinner.\n\nI can't stand it when people don't think I have an opinion about things or that I can't tell that you're staring at me from across the room and saying shit behind my back, thinking that because I'm fat, I don't have a soul. It hurts. It hurts every single day. I don't like looking at myself in the mirror, and I don't even go to the doctor unless I abso-fucking-lutely have to, because I have to step on that scale and he's just going to judge me because I haven't lost any weight since the last time I saw him.\n\nI've never really had a real boyfriend. I had one in high school, and two since then, but to me, I don't know, they just don't count. They said that I looked beautiful but I can never believe them. Even my friends sometimes say that I don't look fat, or that it's not a big deal, but I can never let myself believe them; I know it doesn't really make sense, but I immediately dismiss their compliments. I have zero self-confidence due to people berating me while I was growing up. (In 7th grade when the other girls got their new cheerleading uniforms, one of the girls' uniforms was a smidge baggy (aka not skin-tight), and I heard her from across the room say to the people around her  \"it's like, [my name]-sized.\") It's harder for me to make friends, even though I'm actually a really nice, friendly person who can be funny and has good taste in TV and movies.  I feel like because I'm fat, I have to compensate by being nice, so even if I want to be mean, I just let it by...because otherwise, I would be the fat bitch instead of the fat girl. And if there's anything worse (by American society standards) than a fat girl, it's a fat bitch. \n\nMost of my friends are guys, because they tend to be less bitchy. They see me as a person, instead of as a fat girl with no soul (although, I'm sure a lot of them see me as a fat girl). I also tend to prefer hanging out with guys because I don't spend damn near every minute that I'm with them wishing that I had their body, that I could wear the things they do, that just once I could get the attention from guys that they do. That I had their self-confidence, that I could just go up and talk to someone without them referring to me as \"that fat girl\" later. For once in my life I would like to be known as the tall girl, the smart girl, the girl with nice hair, the girl with pretty blue eyes, the girl with the nice smile...*anything* but the fat girl. \n\nThe truth is, I'm a pretty awesome person, who is really nice, smart, talented, funny, great cook,  basically everything that everyone says they want in a girlfriend, but since I'm a fat girl, no one even gives me a chance. I'm secretly worried that I will spend the rest of my life alone, and I'll never get a chance to experience real love or happiness.\n\nI'm sorry that I kind of ranted, but..it really felt good to get it out there, even if no one reads this. \n\ntl;dr: being a fat girl sucks.
