That&amp;#39;s quite a feat even if it isn&amp;#39;t making a complete sentences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I absolutely agree that Koko was highly misrepresented, ASL doesn&amp;#39;t really have sentences in the same way we think of them. So, simple sentences like, &amp;quot;This ball is red,&amp;quot; would just be pointing at/holding the ball and signing, &amp;quot;ball red,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;red ball.&amp;quot; It would be very basic sign language like what we teach babies nowadays.

We recently moved back to my hometown to be close to family and friends, so we're working on it. :)\n\nSo, I have a bit of a weird story, but maybe it can help a bit. I was an allo donor of bone marrow in my mid-twenties to a woman I didn't know with AML. I allowed my info to be available and after about a year I was contacted by the donee.\n\nShe no longer has signs of leukemia, but she did develop GVHD, which has since turned into cGVHD. She doesn't have any severe issues, but she does receive boosters, IVIG treatments, and some monthly supplements. Her cGVHD it's totally manageable and she hasn't had any surprises for a long time. I'm not completely sure what symptoms she has now other than some tightening of the tendons, her hair hasn't really come back, minor GI tract issues, being tired, but I think that's about it.\n\nAbout five years after I had donated bone marrow I was diagnosed with ALL. I immediately started chemotherapy and showed no signs of leukemia after that first round. Because my WBC count was really high when I was diagnosed (305,000) they said I had a really high chance of it coming back and heavily suggested I have a transplant. They never did stage my leukemia though. When we asked about it they told us that it didn't really work like that for me because it was a blood disease. Normally \"stages\" are determined by how large and how spread out the tumors are on a body, as far as I know.\n\nIf her oncologists are wanting to have less appointments with her then that seems like a good thing. I'm fairly certain they're wanting to test how her immune system will respond to some minor issue that's controllable under their supervision. It's going to tell her body to start making WBC to go attack the GVHD, which it will hopefully do without creating excessive amounts of WBC, like what was happening with the leukemia. I'm not a doctor, but my SO and I are talking and everything we're thinking and looking up seems to indicate that she's on a good path. :)\n\nI had an unusually difficult transplant, so I'm sure (and I absolutely hope) that your wife won't have a similar experience at all. I ended up catching c. diff twice while I was quarantined and was so sick that I wasn't able to leave the  hospital for 83 days. I already had GVHD of the skin, GI tract, and liver by the time I was released from the hospital. Every time I have a health issue it's because GVHD has caused it or something happened and GVHD started attacking it afterwards. As of now my GVHD has spread to my skin, tendons, mouth, liver, stomach, GI tract, and lungs. It's possible that osteoporosis is connected to my GVHD, but I'm not really sure. I have some other random side effects, though I don't know if they're from the surgeries, the treatments, the GVHD, or something else, haha.\n\nI had the flu, which turned into pneumonia in the winter of 2021 and 2022 and that's what has done the most damage to an essential organ (lungs). I'm on a high concentration of continuous flow oxygen 24x7 now. It's also the reason they say I won't live too long. Normally they would recommend a lung transplant, but the chances are that I wouldn't survive a one.\n\nHopefully I didn't give you too much unnecessary info. If you have any more questions feel free to send a DM or comment. It sounds (to my SO and I) like your wife is doing well. Of course, I am not a doctor and I am not an expert on any of this stuff, so don't just take my word for it. I hope I'm right and she doesn't have to do any photopheresis or any other annoying treatments and get back to your normal life!\n\n**EDIT**: I can send you a private message with a link to a Facebook group for people with GVHD.
