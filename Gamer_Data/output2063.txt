Second Wind keeps getting refreshed by DOTs, so you will sustain a surprising amount &amp; unflinching gives you extra tenacity.\n\n\nStat shards: Haste is the definite, and then probably double MR shards.\n\n\nSummoners: Ghost &amp; TP. You don't have the kill pressure here for Ignite to help, while TP lets you get extra recalls to heal.\n\n\nStarting Item: Doran's Shield and a potion. Between Doran's Shield and Second Wind, you'll regen a lot of Teemo's harass.\n\n\nBoots: either Lucidity, Merc's, or Steelcaps. While the Steelcaps attack reduction won't change Teemo's E damage, it will matter &amp; be useful vs zed &amp; Senna. The summoner spell Haste on lucidity gives you extra TPs which is huge for if you need to TP early. Swifties might be worthwhile, but I haven't tried them. If you want lucidity, save up to buy them first back, otherwise look to complete them on your second or third base. I'm not convinced about Merc's here, since you already have two sources of Tenacity, and Merc's aren't worth it just for MR.\n\n\nMythic: Sunderer is definitely the choice with this build. Sheen is the only big jump in gold, so if you back on 700 get that (if on 1k, getting sheen + to boots is pretty big). In this matchup, kindlegem is better than the warhammer, so go for that first.\n\n\nFor second item, go Spirit Visage. It's great on Nasus &amp; the Spectres Cowl passive does work vs Teemo.\n\n\nNext might seem weird at first, but Frozen Heart. The attack speed slow is a big deal with both Teemo and Senna, though not as much against Zed. If you still need more MR though, go Force of Nature. It's so good.\n\n\n\nI'd say your fourth item should be whichever of those two you didn't buy.\n\n\n\nFifth item onwards is very game dependent. Stoneplate is a reliable option, but there's also room for some weirder picks, like Anathema's Chains, or even Hullbreaker if you're ahead. If you need more armour, there's also Dead Man's Plate as an option; the passive MS will matter into their team.\n\n\nAlso, as someone else pointed out, if you are going to get thornmail, you can just sit on the Bramble Vest, and finish it later, or as your last item. However, I don't think it's that important on Nasus, and you have enough armour that lifesteal/healing likely won't make you need more Qs to kill them.
