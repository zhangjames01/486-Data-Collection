We were a small enough company that I learned how to do not just my job but several other jobs, which has given me an incredible amount of maneuverability. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m actually currently considering a lateral move to a different department at my new job because my manager&amp;#39;s friend just retired and she recommended me for the position. Working at the previous company gave me the skillsets of both jobs, so here I am less than a year later about to leverage that experience into a promotion and another $15K raise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plus, I actually really enjoyed what I did and the team I worked with. I ultimately left not because of the money but because upper management kept throwing more work at us than we could handle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ltw2t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/11ltw2t/slap_in_the_face/jbh59iq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/11ltw2t/slap_in_the_face/", "name": "t1_jbh59iq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/antiwork", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678321477.0, "created_utc": 1678321477.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/xfyv7yhjkjma1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y77d", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Slap in the face", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "antiwork", "link_author": "Adelu1219", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbh3xrl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "High_Seas_Pirate", "num_comments": 887, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbgdsp1", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_ee3x7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;When the incentives change, behavior changes\n\nOr when incentives *don't* change, in the case of stagnant pay.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the incentives change, behavior changes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or when incentives &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; change, in the case of stagnant pay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ltw2t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/antiwork/comments/11ltw2t/slap_in_the_face/jbh3xrl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/11ltw2t/slap_in_the_face/", "name": "t1_jbh3xrl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/antiwork", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678320897.0, "created_utc": 1678320897.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/xfyv7yhjkjma1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2y77d", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Slap in the face", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "antiwork", "link_author": "Adelu1219", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbh3qaq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "High_Seas_Pirate", "num_comments": 887, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbgfuup", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_ee3x7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Best of luck!
