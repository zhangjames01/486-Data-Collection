It could be a broken wire too, or a broken patch cord, but it's almost always a punchdown that didn't actually go in to the blades in the jack.

Plug the twisted-together cord into the jack on one end, then take the other half to the other end.\n5. On the other end of the run, use the other half of the cord to measure resistance between each pair on your multimeter.  One of them will be disconnected or high resistance, that's the one that's a problem.\n\nA lot of people don't bother with this kind of thing even if they have a cable tester, since it's fairly quick to just replace or re-punch both jacks.\n\nI can't really recommend having a cable tester around unless you're a networking enthusiast in general.
