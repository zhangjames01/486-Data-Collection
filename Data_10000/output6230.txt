Actually, that seems like a good name for that intermissionary period between innocence and puberty, where you find yourself spending a half an hour downloading an extremely poor quality jpeg of Gillian Anderson's head attached awkwardly to the naked body of a less discerning young woman, (who was ready to do anything to make it in hollywood, despite the promise she made to her older brother who raised her after her parents were murdered brutally on a mission of peace and charity to the 3rd world, where they had hoped to make a real difference in the world, not like those shifty Waltons across the street. They always knew they were scheming up something awful in that garage. They never did get a chance to find out what though. What with the brutal murdering, and all.) via AOL, just so you can look at the product of whatever the '90s version of Photoshop was. Probably Photoshop. It probably came in a big, stupid oversized box, and contained 88% air, 10% 5 and a quarter inch (oh wait, the 90s... we were at the 3 and a halves at that point, if my preteen memory remembers the memories memorably) so anyway. Back to the time that I thought I was going to be able to stop typing. Just now. I stopped and then I was like post it? Delete it? Shit, I spend like 20 or so minutes typing my axons and dendrites out. Which, by the way, are your brains neurotransmitter pitchers and catchers. axons send them out. axon starts with a. So does away. That's what they taught me in brain school. Or whatever it was that I did in that complex of buildings, sidewalks and grass. &lt;=Oxford comma, or no oxford comma? I still don't know which one is right. I also don't want to know. I don't have time in my life for such things right now. I have to focus on typing the world's most longest and pointless comment in a thread I can no longer remember the title of. Sherman! That's right! He got laid eventually, by the Nadia chick. Holy fuck she was hot, am I right? Oh, nobody read this far? That's a very good thing. Because this is where I am going to hide the secret. The secret is: If you have happy positive thoughts, those thoughts will come true. And if you think about having malaria and west nile virus for some crazy reason you get to live in Africa, where the quality of life is unacceptable in many areas. It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that while I live my life trying to get a handle on my own psychological malfunctions, there are other humans, that for but the roll of the quantum die, could have just as easily been me. I would no longer have to worry about ADHD and depression and anxiety and all those problems you are lucky to be able to care about. I'd be too busy training daily to combat mosquitoes from a distance with whatever sort of missile weapon I can manage to fashion out of a stick that isn't even straight, a rock that isn't even round, and a t-shirt with a championship sports team that aren't even champions. And I would've called it, \"The Patriot missile launcher\" (Get it? Because the Seahawks are gonna win, and also, a patriot missile is a missile used to intercept incoming missiles, which is analogous to the disease spreading asshole vampire flies.)\n\nOk. I've got things to do. Sorry to end this hear so suddenly. I hope you all have a wonderful evening. And may the best team win this Sunday. Or the Seahawks, if the Seahawks are actually the worse team, I'd still rather they won. If the Eli can do it, well, I dunno actually. I've lived in Seattle my whole life so it's always been the Seahawks for me. Growing up, once the Seahawks were done playing, I was done watching. I had no interest in the full scope of the NFL until the Seahawks got really good recently. It had me watching deeper into the playoffs, as well as spending inordinate amounts of time on NFL.com, which isn't ran as well as I think it should be. How fuckin' frequently do you get on there, see a new article, and say YAY a new article! Open, and find yourself on the same fuckin' article from 2 days ago. They just reworded the title to fool you into, what, I don't even know. Spending more time on a site that you will end up hating because after you've scoured everything worth consuming on there, you are left with deflated footballs and absurd fines for somebody that is absolutely drawing more attention to the league than a standardly answered interview ever would. And those fuckin' interviews are straight up retarded anyhow. \"How did you feel when you dropped what would have been the game winning catch?\" It's all garbage filler nonsense pointlessness. Even more pointless than this novel of nonsensical novelties that I seem to be constructing with whatever words are leftover after Gronk confused a Random House dictionary with a box of holiday-themed Alpha-Bits this last weekend. To be fair, why do paper dictionaries continue to exist? Are we seriously so stubborn and afraid of change as a species that we don't make the most obvious steps towards a more ideal living space, here between the stratosphere and the upper mantle. Like WHY IS ANYBODY STILL NOT USING THE METRIC SYSTEM. It's fuckin' absurd. Did we not learn anything when billions of dollars were wasted on that mars mission? If money isn't enough to change the stubborn mind, I think we may all be doomed. Just kidding. Humanity is resilient. We are stubborn because we can afford to be. We've made enough right decisions in our half million year run to handle the occasional bout of absolute idiocy. Doesn't mean I'm happy about it. Efficiency is paramount. Actually, safety should be paramount. Efficiency should be a very close second. But they aren't. Emotions are first, second, third, and so on. People get scared, and hungry and then the view of any sort of big picture concerns fly out the window. But that's acceptable I guess. It's how the human brain was ever so inefficiently designed. Evolution doesn't care about the big picture. Evolution is worried about spiders, and boo-boos, and seeing patterns so effectively that it sees more patterns than truly exist. Hence the whole conspiracy culture. Fuck that obnoxious bull ish. I understand that the brain works like it was designed, but I was quite successful at overcoming my base paranoias. I understand why we think we hear words in music played backwards. I understand why people will think that any bad thing that ever happens was somebody they are supposed to be able to trust. I understand why there was a piece of topography on Mars that with that right shading and angle looked like a face. Because our stupid brains are stupid. Not really, but I just wish that people could learn to quit being such fucking stubborn mules about change and learning new concepts, and in the process, admit to themselves that maybe they had been wrong in the past and that it was just there brain trying to protect them from sabre-toothed tigers. But instead, it's a whole heaping compost pile of denial and willing ignorance. There is an antenna that controls the weather that the government is lying to us about!! Anarchy! Down with ~~bush~~ ~~slick willy~~ ~~bush again, but a different one~~ ~~that muslim non-american!~~. Fucking people. Pull your god damned heads out of the comfort and safety of your assholes. If we could all finally get past all the stupidity of racism and (religion, but I do try to respect those who passively worship their \"gods\" or whatever. But try to force your fuckin' ways on me? Fuck you arrogant, self-centered piece of fuck(My dad is Catholic. He is a pretty big asshole in my book. Not because of his faith, but because of his actions towards me and my own personal beliefs. Fuckin' dickhead. aaanyway..)) where was I? Oh, all the stupidity that holds us back. Do you know that Norman Borlaug, the father of genetic engineering and the green revolution, has been credited with saving over 1,000,000,000 lives? It is a fact. Genetically engineered crops were the answer to the planets swelling population and extended lengths of life. And the science behind it is very well established. There is no harm to be had. And if there ever is a real problem with a new GMO strain, I'm sure our scientists aren't going to ignore it.

Actually, that seems like a good name for that intermissionary period between innocence and puberty, where you find yourself spending a half an hour downloading an extremely poor quality jpeg of Gillian Anderson&amp;#39;s head attached awkwardly to the naked body of a less discerning young woman, (who was ready to do anything to make it in hollywood, despite the promise she made to her older brother who raised her after her parents were murdered brutally on a mission of peace and charity to the 3rd world, where they had hoped to make a real difference in the world, not like those shifty Waltons across the street. They always knew they were scheming up something awful in that garage. They never did get a chance to find out what though. What with the brutal murdering, and all.) via AOL, just so you can look at the product of whatever the &amp;#39;90s version of Photoshop was. Probably Photoshop. It probably came in a big, stupid oversized box, and contained 88% air, 10% 5 and a quarter inch (oh wait, the 90s... we were at the 3 and a halves at that point, if my preteen memory remembers the memories memorably) so anyway. Back to the time that I thought I was going to be able to stop typing. Just now. I stopped and then I was like post it? Delete it? Shit, I spend like 20 or so minutes typing my axons and dendrites out. Which, by the way, are your brains neurotransmitter pitchers and catchers. axons send them out. axon starts with a. So does away. That&amp;#39;s what they taught me in brain school. Or whatever it was that I did in that complex of buildings, sidewalks and grass. &amp;lt;=Oxford comma, or no oxford comma? I still don&amp;#39;t know which one is right. I also don&amp;#39;t want to know. I don&amp;#39;t have time in my life for such things right now. I have to focus on typing the world&amp;#39;s most longest and pointless comment in a thread I can no longer remember the title of. Sherman! That&amp;#39;s right! He got laid eventually, by the Nadia chick. Holy fuck she was hot, am I right? Oh, nobody read this far? That&amp;#39;s a very good thing. Because this is where I am going to hide the secret. The secret is: If you have happy positive thoughts, those thoughts will come true. And if you think about having malaria and west nile virus for some crazy reason you get to live in Africa, where the quality of life is unacceptable in many areas. It&amp;#39;s hard to wrap my head around the fact that while I live my life trying to get a handle on my own psychological malfunctions, there are other humans, that for but the roll of the quantum die, could have just as easily been me. I would no longer have to worry about ADHD and depression and anxiety and all those problems you are lucky to be able to care about. I&amp;#39;d be too busy training daily to combat mosquitoes from a distance with whatever sort of missile weapon I can manage to fashion out of a stick that isn&amp;#39;t even straight, a rock that isn&amp;#39;t even round, and a t-shirt with a championship sports team that aren&amp;#39;t even champions. And I would&amp;#39;ve called it, &amp;quot;The Patriot missile launcher&amp;quot; (Get it? Because the Seahawks are gonna win, and also, a patriot missile is a missile used to intercept incoming missiles, which is analogous to the disease spreading asshole vampire flies.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. I&amp;#39;ve got things to do. Sorry to end this hear so suddenly. I hope you all have a wonderful evening. And may the best team win this Sunday. Or the Seahawks, if the Seahawks are actually the worse team, I&amp;#39;d still rather they won. If the Eli can do it, well, I dunno actually. I&amp;#39;ve lived in Seattle my whole life so it&amp;#39;s always been the Seahawks for me. Growing up, once the Seahawks were done playing, I was done watching. I had no interest in the full scope of the NFL until the Seahawks got really good recently. It had me watching deeper into the playoffs, as well as spending inordinate amounts of time on NFL.com, which isn&amp;#39;t ran as well as I think it should be. How fuckin&amp;#39; frequently do you get on there, see a new article, and say YAY a new article! Open, and find yourself on the same fuckin&amp;#39; article from 2 days ago. They just reworded the title to fool you into, what, I don&amp;#39;t even know. Spending more time on a site that you will end up hating because after you&amp;#39;ve scoured everything worth consuming on there, you are left with deflated footballs and absurd fines for somebody that is absolutely drawing more attention to the league than a standardly answered interview ever would. And those fuckin&amp;#39; interviews are straight up retarded anyhow. &amp;quot;How did you feel when you dropped what would have been the game winning catch?&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s all garbage filler nonsense pointlessness. Even more pointless than this novel of nonsensical novelties that I seem to be constructing with whatever words are leftover after Gronk confused a Random House dictionary with a box of holiday-themed Alpha-Bits this last weekend. To be fair, why do paper dictionaries continue to exist? Are we seriously so stubborn and afraid of change as a species that we don&amp;#39;t make the most obvious steps towards a more ideal living space, here between the stratosphere and the upper mantle. Like WHY IS ANYBODY STILL NOT USING THE METRIC SYSTEM. It&amp;#39;s fuckin&amp;#39; absurd. Did we not learn anything when billions of dollars were wasted on that mars mission? If money isn&amp;#39;t enough to change the stubborn mind, I think we may all be doomed. Just kidding. Humanity is resilient. We are stubborn because we can afford to be. We&amp;#39;ve made enough right decisions in our half million year run to handle the occasional bout of absolute idiocy. Doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;m happy about it. Efficiency is paramount. Actually, safety should be paramount. Efficiency should be a very close second. But they aren&amp;#39;t. Emotions are first, second, third, and so on. People get scared, and hungry and then the view of any sort of big picture concerns fly out the window. But that&amp;#39;s acceptable I guess. It&amp;#39;s how the human brain was ever so inefficiently designed. Evolution doesn&amp;#39;t care about the big picture. Evolution is worried about spiders, and boo-boos, and seeing patterns so effectively that it sees more patterns than truly exist. Hence the whole conspiracy culture. Fuck that obnoxious bull ish. I understand that the brain works like it was designed, but I was quite successful at overcoming my base paranoias. I understand why we think we hear words in music played backwards. I understand why people will think that any bad thing that ever happens was somebody they are supposed to be able to trust. I understand why there was a piece of topography on Mars that with that right shading and angle looked like a face. Because our stupid brains are stupid. Not really, but I just wish that people could learn to quit being such fucking stubborn mules about change and learning new concepts, and in the process, admit to themselves that maybe they had been wrong in the past and that it was just there brain trying to protect them from sabre-toothed tigers. But instead, it&amp;#39;s a whole heaping compost pile of denial and willing ignorance. There is an antenna that controls the weather that the government is lying to us about!! Anarchy! Down with &lt;del&gt;bush&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;slick willy&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;bush again, but a different one&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;that muslim non-american!&lt;/del&gt;. Fucking people. Pull your god damned heads out of the comfort and safety of your assholes. If we could all finally get past all the stupidity of racism and (religion, but I do try to respect those who passively worship their &amp;quot;gods&amp;quot; or whatever. But try to force your fuckin&amp;#39; ways on me? Fuck you arrogant, self-centered piece of fuck(My dad is Catholic. He is a pretty big asshole in my book. Not because of his faith, but because of his actions towards me and my own personal beliefs. Fuckin&amp;#39; dickhead. aaanyway..)) where was I? Oh, all the stupidity that holds us back. Do you know that Norman Borlaug, the father of genetic engineering and the green revolution, has been credited with saving over 1,000,000,000 lives? It is a fact. Genetically engineered crops were the answer to the planets swelling population and extended lengths of life. And the science behind it is very well established. There is no harm to be had. And if there ever is a real problem with a new GMO strain, I&amp;#39;m sure our scientists aren&amp;#39;t going to ignore it.
