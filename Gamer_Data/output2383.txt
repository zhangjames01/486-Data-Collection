So when you hear your 'pulsing', try to measure it against your heartbeat or pulse by placing your fingers on your wrist and see if the pulsing occurs in time with your pulse. If it doesn't = not PT.

Even if you feel well, an opening pressure like that means something is up. Better to sort it out sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you ruled out venous sinus stenosis with contrast MRV reviewed by an interventional neuroradiologist? Venous sinus stenting isn&amp;#39;t for everyone but it&amp;#39;s possible you may have VSS which may be playing a larger role in terms of your CSF pressures and should be at least addressed. Noting of course that catheter cerebral venogram and venous manometry is needed to confirm VSS - even if VSS is found on MRV, it is the pressure gradient that determines if one is a stent candidate. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I didn&amp;#39;t have confirmed IIH (no paps, headache or lumbar puncture), but was told I had a &amp;#39;forme fruste&amp;#39; version of IIH (early form due to VSS, pulsatile tinnitus, pressure and fluid behind optic nerve sheaths). I did have venous sinus stenosis and debilitating PT though, which is why I sought out stenting. Had I not done so, I was told I was likely to manifest full IIH at some point. Resolving my VSS and PT was a great choice and I got to bypass taking diamox entirely, but I know that some specialists will opt to try meds first. if diamox wasn&amp;#39;t agreeable with you in the past, could they at least try topamax or something this time? If meds are not agreeable at all, then confirming VSS and stent candidacy may be the next logical step.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11waz4d", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/iih/comments/11waz4d/iih_is_back_but/jcx87wf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/11waz4d/iih_is_back_but/", "name": "t1_jcx87wf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/iih", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679295611.0, "created_utc": 1679295611.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/11waz4d/iih_is_back_but/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2saf4", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Can it just dissapear ?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "tinnitus", "link_author": "Bromofromlatvia", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcwuxz1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Neyface", "num_comments": 26, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcwjdou", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_6q469", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; How do you explain that, other than inflammation being higher or lower?

The anxiety is very real.\n\nI had venous PT for four years straight, left ear only. I slept with a fan on, every night. I also found my PT was slightly less when I slept on my left side, because my PT was caused by venous sinus stenosis and sleeping on the same side compressed my jugular vein ever so slightly enough with my pillow to dampen the sound (I could stop my PT with light jugular compression which is classic sign of venous sinus stenosis as the cause). The fan was really good at masking my low frequency whooshing, which sounded like wind but was loud enough I could record it on bad days. The sensation of wind on my face also helped me to not focus on the physical sensation of the turbulent blood flow through my stenosis. So it was a double win. Your PT may not be caused by venous sinus stenosis, but I think it's a very successful method of masking for most PT-sufferers, and tinnitus more broadly.\n\nI was treated with venous sinus stenting last year to resolve the stenosis and it also solved my venous pulsatile tinnitus.

The anxiety is very real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had venous PT for four years straight, left ear only. I slept with a fan on, every night. I also found my PT was slightly less when I slept on my left side, because my PT was caused by venous sinus stenosis and sleeping on the same side compressed my jugular vein ever so slightly enough with my pillow to dampen the sound (I could stop my PT with light jugular compression which is classic sign of venous sinus stenosis as the cause). The fan was really good at masking my low frequency whooshing, which sounded like wind but was loud enough I could record it on bad days. The sensation of wind on my face also helped me to not focus on the physical sensation of the turbulent blood flow through my stenosis. So it was a double win. Your PT may not be caused by venous sinus stenosis, but I think it&amp;#39;s a very successful method of masking for most PT-sufferers, and tinnitus more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was treated with venous sinus stenting last year to resolve the stenosis and it also solved my venous pulsatile tinnitus.

The only way to 100% determine whether the AG is incidental or causing stenosis is with catheter cerebral venogram and venous manometry. this will measure pressure gradients either side of the suspected AG stenosis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the OP doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be experiencing symptoms like PT etc. it is more likely this AG is of normal calibre and that the venous sinuses are likely remaining patent with no increase of intravenous pressures or venous congestion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11urwtn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/iih/comments/11urwtn/arachnoid_granulationretention_cyst_in_mri/jcrfb7h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/11urwtn/arachnoid_granulationretention_cyst_in_mri/", "name": "t1_jcrfb7h", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/iih", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679183836.0, "created_utc": 1679183836.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/iih/comments/11urwtn/arachnoid_granulationretention_cyst_in_mri/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r1ca", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Anyone have any experience studying marine biology at tertiary level?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Adelaide", "link_author": "joot14", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcr8707", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Neyface", "num_comments": 8, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcoyxod", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6q469", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Goodluck, and have fun!
