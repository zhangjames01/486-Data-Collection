Not even a suspicion? What are they, stupid? No, in fact Greece was not the only country doing this. I don't have too much time to spend in google for this but i quickly came up with [this article](http://www.theweek.co.uk/business/16599/evidence-mounts-greece-cooked-books), here's a quote: \n\n&gt;But others point out that cooking the books is not so unusual: both France and Germany have at various times sold off assets to trim deficits. \"Fiddling the books has become the order of the day,\" Karl Heinz D\u00e4ke, president of a German taxpayers' lobby group, once explained. \"The German government and other European countries are hiding their cards from the public.\"\n\n So lets not pretend to be shocked by the book cooking. I believe it was more of a lets all look the other way situation, than a big scandal that caught everyone by surprise. \n\n Of course it is still bad. It is fraud. But its not something to be pinned solely on the Greek side, or something exremely huge. The huge guilt of Greece should be borrowing to feed the government workers/friends/relatives while shutting down remaining industry and a general looting of the economy.\n\n p.s. To introduce another angle to the Greek issue: Cyprus is drilling for natural gas. Greece has gas also. Lots of it. Why doesn't Greece and the rest of the EU do a natural gas for debt swap? Gas will be bought from somewhere either way. Why not even *start* doing this to solve part of the problem? Greek debt is huge as a % of GDP, but at less than 400 bn euros it is not huge in absolute numbers, at least compared to other states'. I will venture to say that selling rights to exploration/drilling would let Greece cover payment of debt interest in a significant portion at least, without borrowing more in a vicious spiral.
