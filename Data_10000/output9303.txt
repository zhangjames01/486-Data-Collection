If he wants some emotional support, that's what his wife is for. \n\nWhat you're failing to see here is that he's the one being selfish. Stress can have a negative effect on a person's recovery process and clearly this is something that would be stressful to her. Not only will she know there are other people in the house demanding time with her child but she also has to now worry about her husband not caring about her clearly set boundaries and ones that he did accept even if he was huffy about it. This is a hard line in the sand for her and not as much for him since he did initially accept the boundary. \nBut not only is he going back on something he accepted months before, now he's letting his father push those boundaries as well which is a whole other issue. OP even said in her post that they made their boundaries clear and the MIL accepted. It seems like she understands at the very least. But if they start pushing boundaries now? What's next? Not allowing mom time with her baby when she requests it? Forcing their way into her bedroom while she's awake? We can't know that. A lot of grandparents feel entitled to that time with their grandchild when they most certainly are not.\n\nI wouldn't call her controlling in the least. 2 weeks is the bare minimum for recovery after a vaginal delivery. It's even longer after a C-section so I think she's being more than fair. And do you think being born isn't traumatic for a baby? They also need time to get used to being on the outside and learning what it means to just be. Babies need stability and to be primarily with their parents, especially the one that's feeding them which if she's breast feeding, that'd be OP. So even if they came, what are they gonna see? A whole lotta nothing really. But they aren't going to support their son, they're going to see a baby. So how will they react when baby is basically always locked in the bedroom with OP?\n\nI'm glad if you had a good experience with you ILs when you had kids, but not everyone has that. Not everyone wants them around for awhile and they just need their time to recover and be a new parent. Even if husband is being huffy now, he might be really thankful their not there after the baby's born. Men can get PPD too and have a really hard time and not want to deal with it. But he's not thinking about that either. I get the excitement over a new baby and wanting to show them off, but in reality you have to think about what's best for the mom and the new baby and this ain't it. He needs to suck it up and stick to the boundary he's already agreed to. And again, it's 2 weeks. 2 WEEKS. That is NOTHING when their gonna have a lifetime with this kid.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "GIRL", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s advocating for her mom because her mom is there to actually help.

Stress can have a negative effect on a person&amp;#39;s recovery process and clearly this is something that would be stressful to her. Not only will she know there are other people in the house demanding time with her child but she also has to now worry about her husband not caring about her clearly set boundaries and ones that he did accept even if he was huffy about it. This is a hard line in the sand for her and not as much for him since he did initially accept the boundary. \nBut not only is he going back on something he accepted months before, now he&amp;#39;s letting his father push those boundaries as well which is a whole other issue. OP even said in her post that they made their boundaries clear and the MIL accepted. It seems like she understands at the very least. But if they start pushing boundaries now? What&amp;#39;s next?
