I had to remind myself that this was war.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The footage of this episode has been deemed too disturbing for our audiences, even though nobody was actually harmed. One interesting feature of the footage is that your voice is very clearly audible, shouting racial slurs at the &amp;#39;prisoners&amp;#39; as you shock them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I decline to comment on that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what happened on the second day?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;On the second day, the interrogation recommenced. I asked the interrogator in the morning whether the electrocutions were safe or not.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And what did he say?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He said that they were.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thomas, we have footage of him then saying &amp;#39;probably&amp;#39; and slapping you on the back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s Koperniak. I believed him when he said they were safe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For how long?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;By the middle of the first day... two of the suspected militants had collapsed and ceased to move, even when electrocuted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And did you believe them to be dead?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And on the second day, when six had collapsed unmoving?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I did not know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And on the fourth day, when the twelfth &lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;suspected militant&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;, after begging for his life and crying for four days, finally collapsed unmoving?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. I did not know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How could you not have known?
