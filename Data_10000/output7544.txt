Of course, this doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me at all and it was something I was prepared for.  I knew he frequents strip clubs and it just so happens that I know a fair few strippers/bouncers.  So I waited (this part took about 3 weeks) for him to enter a strip club, I called a few strippers who will do anything for money (coke I&amp;#39;m sure), made sure they took him home to give him gonasyphaherpeles or any myriad of STDs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, I wrote off the rest of the balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr  bf of friend borrows $, fails to payback.
