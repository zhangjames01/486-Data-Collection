They\u2019ve been building low-mid range PC\u2019s for the Xbox since the beginning. \n\nWhere Sony\u2019s expertise lay is within hardware engineering and design. While the average Playstation gamer doesn\u2019t like that the Series X has higher numbers on paper, anyone that has built their own computers will tell you that the name of the game in hardware is thermal management. Better controlled temperatures lead to better sustainability in hardware. \n\nTo keep it simple; the reasons Sony\u2019s numbers are lower on paper is because they\u2019ve effectively chosen to make sure the hardware will keep up to task for years, with only a minor difference in performance overall. \n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting is their choice of working with all sorts of studios around the SSD idea. Putting in a solid state drive that is almost twice as fast as currently available hardware will lead to more interesting game design choices. Developers can ignore old tricks they were forced to use to work around bottlenecks in the hardware and just focus on making it fun or new. For the general consumer they see 825GB&lt;1TB and immediately reject Sony\u2019s proposal, when in fact, this choice will pay dividends with the developers. It gives them the ability to think outside the box, and while an SSD is good step forward for consoles in general, Sony\u2019s choice to leap forward with future thinking hardware is smart, and will lead to more creative software. \n\nThat plus using standardized m.2 SSDs will be a huge bonus because once they are available, prices drop rapidly on these things unless crazy constraints show up. It\u2019s a win, especially if Microsoft gouges prices on their storage, which they have before in the 360 era.

They\u2019ve been building low-mid range PC\u2019s for the Xbox since the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where Sony\u2019s expertise lay is within hardware engineering and design. While the average Playstation gamer doesn\u2019t like that the Series X has higher numbers on paper, anyone that has built their own computers will tell you that the name of the game in hardware is thermal management. Better controlled temperatures lead to better sustainability in hardware. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To keep it simple; the reasons Sony\u2019s numbers are lower on paper is because they\u2019ve effectively chosen to make sure the hardware will keep up to task for years, with only a minor difference in performance overall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s really interesting is their choice of working with all sorts of studios around the SSD idea. Putting in a solid state drive that is almost twice as fast as currently available hardware will lead to more interesting game design choices. Developers can ignore old tricks they were forced to use to work around bottlenecks in the hardware and just focus on making it fun or new. For the general consumer they see 825GB&amp;lt;1TB and immediately reject Sony\u2019s proposal, when in fact, this choice will pay dividends with the developers. It gives them the ability to think outside the box, and while an SSD is good step forward for consoles in general, Sony\u2019s choice to leap forward with future thinking hardware is smart, and will lead to more creative software. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That plus using standardized m.2 SSDs will be a huge bonus because once they are available, prices drop rapidly on these things unless crazy constraints show up.
