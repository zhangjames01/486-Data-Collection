I'd stick to just one color for the propeller blades and then another for the lettering (with no outlines on either).

Most typeface designers use Fontlab or FontForge to create useable fonts you can type with, but if you have more experience with Illustrator then it's much easier to stay within Adobe and export your designs later on. I find Fontlab's vector tools to be a bit clunkier than Adobe's, so I use it for the kerning, organization, and exporting that I need to do *after* the character designs are completed.\n\n1. **GRID LINES:** First things first, set up your workfile so that you have all the correct grid lines. If you're using Illustrator, then you should set up grid lines for the ascenders, descenders, x-height, and [all the other typeface heights](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Typography_Line_Terms.svg) you should be thinking about. When I started, I modified a template I found by [watching this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOTLwmmrv8s). You don't need to actually use Fontlab to find the template files in the video description useful. I saw you musing about the \"process\" sketches you see on Behance with all the grids and circles... those are built off of templates like this... and are specific to each process. *Worry more about the typeface and how to make it consistent... not about the process shots.* They are largely unnecessary.\n\n2. **CONCEPT TRACING:** If you have a concept sketch, then import that into your file and start tracing. Try to keep your heights consistent. A little working outside-the-lines is okay for some hand-drawn fonts, but for the EVO inspiration you are drawing from, you should try to be as consistent as possible.\n\n3. **ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS:** Work on the shapes for the main concept characters and carry their designs over to the other similar characters... *b/d/p/q* are usually the same designs, with a few tweaks... same for *m/n/u* and *w/v/y*.\n\n4. **ALL THE CHARACTERS YOU FORGOT ABOUT:** Don't forget to include both upper and lowercase characters, as well as numbers and punctuation if you're trying to be thorough. If you're trying to be even *more* thorough, include special characters like *\u00e6*, *\u00f8*, *\u00e7*, and... um... *\u03a9*? I don't know, you decide how many characters you want.\n\n5. **KERNING AND EXPORTING:** Once you have all the characters completed, you can look around online for how to convert your designs into a type format like .ttf or similar. I copy/paste all my characters into Fontlab and work on the kerning from there, but if you're not using Fontlab then I can't help you. Before you do that, though, *don't forget to outline all of your strokes*, and keep a version of your files that maintains the non-outline characters (in case you want to make a bolder version of the same typeface, or realize you messed up a character or two).\n\n6. **JUST GO AND KILL YOURSELF:** I'm warning you... typeface creation is *boring*. It's fun at first, but by the end you want to pull your brain out your nostril over how many characters there are. Just push through it and you should be rewarded with a nice typeface when you're done.\n\nThat's pretty much the process I've gone through. It's... an experience. I'll give it that.
