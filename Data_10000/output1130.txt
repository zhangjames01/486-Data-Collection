It's akin to LA in that you're really strategizing how to beat some tricky enemies in tricky situations (which LA had a ton of versus LttP).\n\nThe finesse is the learning curve I'd say.

Much of it has to do with simply &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you should play this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes the game &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; for some compared to say a 2D Zelda is more how the finesse of the game works.  You don&amp;#39;t go up to a guy and just attack.  Your drift isn&amp;#39;t invincible (unlike in God of War), meaning it&amp;#39;s not a panacea for just leaving an instance.  And each hit lags to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each attack counts.  Meaning that if you&amp;#39;re going to commit to an attack, you have to go through with it entirely, usually for a kill.  You can&amp;#39;t attack then back off because you WILL get hit when leaving (usually from some straggling enemy).  The drift, then, is much more useful for closing in on an enemy rather than getting yourself out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you figure that out, it makes the game MUCH easier.  It&amp;#39;s akin to LA in that you&amp;#39;re really strategizing how to beat some tricky enemies in tricky situations (which LA had a ton of versus LttP).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The finesse is the learning curve I&amp;#39;d say.

There's hope for many to simply become a postdoc, and that their situations will get better.  Most people that make the complaint about academia having gone through the system could very well leave early (opt out with a Masters).
