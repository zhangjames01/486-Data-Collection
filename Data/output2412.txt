Be prepared for anything. \n\nOur whole journey took 2 years from starting to try to actually getting a successful pregnancy. \n\nI wish someone had told me that it\u2019s not \u201ccollect eggs, make embryos, have a transfer \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\u201d and that lots of other stuff can get in the way. \n\nOur first embryo transfer after making the embryos happened 8 months later. I was delayed over and over again due to my lining not being thick enough, large cysts developing, etc. That was the hardest part of the process in my opinion. Every month thinking I was going to finally have a transfer and then it not working out and having to wait again. \n\nThe number of eggs you get does not equal embryos. And just because you have lots of eggs, doesn\u2019t mean you get lots during collection. I had around 40 eggs when they harvested and they only got 5 that were good enough. Of those, 2 turned into embryos. \n\nEveryone always mentions the injections but, honestly, the injections for the egg collection portion (in your stomach) weren\u2019t bad at all. I got used to injecting very quickly and the needles are small. When it comes to doing a transfer and doing progesterone shots (butt) those are much bigger and caused me waaaay more bruising and pain. But you do what you have to do. You just push through because that\u2019s your only option. You learn to do really hard things. There are also a number of oils that the progesterone can be mixed with, so if you have a bad reaction to one, you can try another next time. \n\nAnd, like another poster mentioned, all these little things like eating warm foods, eating McDonald\u2019s fries after a transfer, etc. etc. aren\u2019t going to impact anything. Live your life the best you can. Just don\u2019t smoke or do drugs or drink heavily. \n\nAlso - get a therapist if you/your partner need. I got extremely depressed and had to leave work for 4 months because I couldn\u2019t function (all the delays and pain and one miscarriage just broken me). Having an objective person to talk to that is trained was very helpful (she also specialized in fertility so that was essential for understanding what I was going through). \n\nYour journey could be much easier and faster, similar to mine, or harder and longer. There is no way to know.

Be prepared for anything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our whole journey took 2 years from starting to try to actually getting a successful pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish someone had told me that it\u2019s not \u201ccollect eggs, make embryos, have a transfer \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\u201d and that lots of other stuff can get in the way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our first embryo transfer after making the embryos happened 8 months later. I was delayed over and over again due to my lining not being thick enough, large cysts developing, etc. That was the hardest part of the process in my opinion. Every month thinking I was going to finally have a transfer and then it not working out and having to wait again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The number of eggs you get does not equal embryos. And just because you have lots of eggs, doesn\u2019t mean you get lots during collection. I had around 40 eggs when they harvested and they only got 5 that were good enough. Of those, 2 turned into embryos. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone always mentions the injections but, honestly, the injections for the egg collection portion (in your stomach) weren\u2019t bad at all. I got used to injecting very quickly and the needles are small. When it comes to doing a transfer and doing progesterone shots (butt) those are much bigger and caused me waaaay more bruising and pain. But you do what you have to do. You just push through because that\u2019s your only option. You learn to do really hard things. There are also a number of oils that the progesterone can be mixed with, so if you have a bad reaction to one, you can try another next time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, like another poster mentioned, all these little things like eating warm foods, eating McDonald\u2019s fries after a transfer, etc. etc. aren\u2019t going to impact anything. Live your life the best you can. Just don\u2019t smoke or do drugs or drink heavily. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also - get a therapist if you/your partner need. I got extremely depressed and had to leave work for 4 months because I couldn\u2019t function (all the delays and pain and one miscarriage just broken me). Having an objective person to talk to that is trained was very helpful (she also specialized in fertility so that was essential for understanding what I was going through). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your journey could be much easier and faster, similar to mine, or harder and longer.
