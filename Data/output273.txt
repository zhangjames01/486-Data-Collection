Browne threw one elbow that hit Gonzaga in the clearly defined &amp;quot;back of the head&amp;quot; area, but it was not intentional. Gonzaga&amp;#39;s head moved as he was already going out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Browne immediately threw another elbow that hit Gonzaga on the ear/behind the ear, and went to throw a small elbow as the referee was stepping in to stop fight. It shows that it was not an intentional strike, because he adjusted his angle of attack when he realized that Gonzaga&amp;#39;s head was turned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the strikes that put Gonzaga out were LEGAL elbow strikes. This is the most important aspect that nobody is looking at. If Browne had hit him in the back of the head to start the sequence, he might have had a valid complaint; however, he did not.
