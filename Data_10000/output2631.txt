The fundamental problem the Americans face is much like we faced in the 1950s... they are starring down the barrel of perpetual geopolitical decline, falling living standards and fading influence, and its scary... that&amp;#39;s why they voted for Trumpin 2016 and its why 3 million more of them voted for him again this time. Trumpism isn&amp;#39;t going away in my opinion and if anything Bidens politically paralysed administration is going to provide fertile ground for a return to some form of &amp;quot;Trump-ist&amp;quot; candidate in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is in 4 years voters will be returning to the polls with an economy probably in worse shape than it is today, higher unemployment, the same geopolitical problems (China, Russia, Iran), the same enviornmental problems and very little to show for Bidens left wing credentials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;European left-wing socialists seem to be more excited about Bidens victory than Americans are... and that says a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_jqsnij", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/jqsnij/rlabouruk_user_posts_a_tweet_about_how_people/gbqfmgp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badunitedkingdom/comments/jqsnij/rlabouruk_user_posts_a_tweet_about_how_people/", "name": "t1_gbqfmgp", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/badunitedkingdom", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1604941102.0, "created_utc": 1604941102.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://np.reddit.com/r/LabourUK/comments/jq9rts/not_sure_why_biden_won_but_my_betting_is_that_the/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3jrjf", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "r/LabourUK user posts a tweet about how people will try to 'explain' Biden's victory in a way to reinforce their own biases.
