Example: a few of my go to flavor additives when I cook are Mustard, salsa, soy sauce, and a type of vinegar. These all add so much flavor, are very cheap compared to the ingredients that make them up.\n\nMy grocery list is this when stocking up at a new place.\n\nA bag of Lentils, brown rice, quinoa (If reasonably priced), and any type of beans.\n\nOn to produce: Romaine hearts, eggs if they're cheap in your area, red cabbage, green peppers, onions (although you don't like them so you can nix it), 5-10 lbs of potatoes/sweet potatoes, carrots and whatever fruit/veggies are in season and on sale to switch it up. Don't forget to find \"reject\" areas, which are ugly, bruised or old produce which will be very cheap! Utilize this and make them for dinner that night, freezing leftovers!\n\nVarious snackies: I have snacking issues too, so I feel ya. My go to snacks are. Bulk jars of pickles, romaine leaves dipped with a sauce (Mustard, hummus (If affordable), salsa, ect.) like chips, fruits, and this season pumpkin seeds. I eat kinda oddly, but its been working to keep my weight under control so WOO!\n\nTo assemble: my go to meal is pretty simple, but I love it. So I pick some veggies to sautee up, usually mushrooms, onion, peppers, carrots, seasoning generously. Maybe add some some potatoes if I have them leftover or a small one cooking until just about done (I would add salsa here if I was feeling it). Add rice/quinoa/lentils. Add appropriate amount of broth/seasoned water. Allow to cook, finish with egg if available.

These all add so much flavor, are very cheap compared to the ingredients that make them up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grocery list is this when stocking up at a new place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bag of Lentils, brown rice, quinoa (If reasonably priced), and any type of beans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to produce: Romaine hearts, eggs if they&amp;#39;re cheap in your area, red cabbage, green peppers, onions (although you don&amp;#39;t like them so you can nix it), 5-10 lbs of potatoes/sweet potatoes, carrots and whatever fruit/veggies are in season and on sale to switch it up. Don&amp;#39;t forget to find &amp;quot;reject&amp;quot; areas, which are ugly, bruised or old produce which will be very cheap! Utilize this and make them for dinner that night, freezing leftovers!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Various snackies: I have snacking issues too, so I feel ya. My go to snacks are. Bulk jars of pickles, romaine leaves dipped with a sauce (Mustard, hummus (If affordable), salsa, ect.) like chips, fruits, and this season pumpkin seeds. I eat kinda oddly, but its been working to keep my weight under control so WOO!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To assemble: my go to meal is pretty simple, but I love it.
