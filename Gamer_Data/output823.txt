It hits only one person, so yes, it is extremely powerful in a 1v1 setting, in which case I suggest using the 1v1 banned list. &lt;a href=\"http://duelcommander.com/banlist/\"&gt;http://duelcommander.com/banlist/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that Mind Twist is on there. :V Hope this helps, buddy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1n0kwt", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/EDH/comments/1n0kwt/why_is_mind_twist_legal_in_edh/ccecaaf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1n0kwt/why_is_mind_twist_legal_in_edh/", "name": "t1_ccecaaf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EDH", "author_flair_text": "Skullbriar, The Nerd Gorger", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1380006923.0, "created_utc": 1380006923.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/1n0kwt/why_is_mind_twist_legal_in_edh/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s580", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Lack of DOTA 2 at PAX; PAX Employee Pete \"Vapok\" Navarra clarifies DOTA 2 unavailable due to no sponsored bandwith PART 3", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 16, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DotA2", "link_author": "oxedei", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cbzwgvc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Droxis", "num_comments": 579, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1lij8q", "score": 16, "author_fullname": "t2_5fl6z", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Video game tribalism is a blight and the worst aspect of the hobby.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video game tribalism is a blight and the worst aspect of the hobby.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1lij8q", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DotA2/comments/1lij8q/lack_of_dota_2_at_pax_pax_employee_pete_vapok/cbzwgvc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1lij8q/lack_of_dota_2_at_pax_pax_employee_pete_vapok/", "name": "t1_cbzwgvc", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DotA2", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1378081016.0, "created_utc": 1378081016.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1lij8q/lack_of_dota_2_at_pax_pax_employee_pete_vapok/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2scee", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How to beat Kaalia of the Vast?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 7, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "EDH", "link_author": "LukiJew", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cbuvhgc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Droxis", "num_comments": 25, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1l1lhf", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_5fl6z", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Condemn, Path to Exile, Swords to Plowshares, Chaos Warp, Prison Term, and Beast Within come to mind for your colors.\n\nThe majority of the time when someone brings a Kaalia to our table, she gets shut down very hard, very early.

Put them down on the table and let me think in peace. I get that you do that because it's your way of directing \"thinking stress\" and/or you are emulating some \"pros\" you saw on a stream, but please have the self awareness to stop doing that during my turn. It's annoying and unnecessary. In before: \"Nurhurhur! That's why we do it, psychological warfare! :B\"\n\n2) Verbal declarations of self perceived advantages or \"dominance.\" Every case I've seen this happen tends to be meshed with childish butt hurt when the delusions are torn down. Guy won't stop jerking himself off about his \"crazy board position\" and that \"it's good game for somebody on my next turn.\" Mood shifts from \"I'm extremely cocky\" to \"you killed my dog\" when that sweet board state is swept off the table. \n\nThe best example of this happening was during a local legacy tournament. I had been on hiatus due to work for a month or two, where new guy decided to start showing up to the shop. He is relatively new to legacy, but has already picked up something of a name for himself in cocksure attitude. I dragged out a combo elves list I've had rotting on a shelf for a long while, showed up, and got paired with him. \n\nHe was playing some iteration of The Rock or Junk (Goofies, confidants, removal, yadda yadda). First game I don't do much but fart out 1/1 elves and get dumpster banged. \"Elves doesn't have a good match up versus me!\" Second game I have another horrendous slow start, but sandbag a hand of elves and glimpse until I can explode off three lands into a hard cast Emrakul.\n\nSuddenly -silence- and -everything is on the line- as if I am witnessing a man defusing a bomb and any mistake will cost him his life. I get a \"regular\" turn 3 blow out and summon the Kooldrazi.

Put them down on the table and let me think in peace. I get that you do that because it&amp;#39;s your way of directing &amp;quot;thinking stress&amp;quot; and/or you are emulating some &amp;quot;pros&amp;quot; you saw on a stream, but please have the self awareness to stop doing that during my turn. It&amp;#39;s annoying and unnecessary. In before: &amp;quot;Nurhurhur! That&amp;#39;s why we do it, psychological warfare! :B&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Verbal declarations of self perceived advantages or &amp;quot;dominance.&amp;quot; Every case I&amp;#39;ve seen this happen tends to be meshed with childish butt hurt when the delusions are torn down. Guy won&amp;#39;t stop jerking himself off about his &amp;quot;crazy board position&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s good game for somebody on my next turn.&amp;quot; Mood shifts from &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m extremely cocky&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;you killed my dog&amp;quot; when that sweet board state is swept off the table. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best example of this happening was during a local legacy tournament. I had been on hiatus due to work for a month or two, where new guy decided to start showing up to the shop. He is relatively new to legacy, but has already picked up something of a name for himself in cocksure attitude. I dragged out a combo elves list I&amp;#39;ve had rotting on a shelf for a long while, showed up, and got paired with him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was playing some iteration of The Rock or Junk (Goofies, confidants, removal, yadda yadda). First game I don&amp;#39;t do much but fart out 1/1 elves and get dumpster banged. &amp;quot;Elves doesn&amp;#39;t have a good match up versus me!&amp;quot; Second game I have another horrendous slow start, but sandbag a hand of elves and glimpse until I can explode off three lands into a hard cast Emrakul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly -silence- and -everything is on the line- as if I am witnessing a man defusing a bomb and any mistake will cost him his life. I get a &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; turn 3 blow out and summon the Kooldrazi. Wouldn&amp;#39;t shake my hand, instead indignantly digging out three engineered plague from his deck and throwing them down on the table in front of me as a visual aid to himself explaining I &amp;quot;should not win because I have these in my deck, you got lucky.&amp;quot; Give me a break, guy (I run a wishboard for that kind of thing! :3).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Honestly going to extend the first belly ache with this: I -really- loathe the habits &amp;quot;pro scenes&amp;quot; have invoked in local players.
