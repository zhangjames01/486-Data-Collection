But one thing Barry has strived for is that people are loyal to the club. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s why his biggest regret with shooting Dundee is that he deprived the club a vote on removing Dundee as PM. It&amp;#39;s why he worked so hard to give Dundee every opportunity to show that he&amp;#39;s changed, and if he&amp;#39;s not changed then the club has to vote him out, he wouldn&amp;#39;t do anything at all until the club decided. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Barry also removed the rule that Dundee established saying that any founder can walk away instead of being blooded out. Barry told the club that if they think he&amp;#39;s doing a shit job and he&amp;#39;s refusing to step down, to shoot him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_116a920", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/116a920/aubrey_pops_off_about_other_gangs_involving/j96zmjg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RPClipsGTA/comments/116a920/aubrey_pops_off_about_other_gangs_involving/", "name": "t1_j96zmjg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RPClipsGTA", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1676833423.0, "created_utc": 1676833423.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://clips.twitch.tv/BumblingAwkwardCrabsKappaRoss-xJ2-yUwiUQFyfhV0"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3onkg", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Dundee's Last Words Before Exploding", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 53, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "RPClipsGTA", "link_author": "GenuineMind", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j8zym9b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "proddy", "num_comments": 102, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j8zwpv4", "score": 53, "author_fullname": "t2_5nvda", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Earlier they spotted him at tuner shop but BBMC had to sell Bundy a Wastelander and set up a mini scenario for him up in Sandy.
