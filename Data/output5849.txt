I went to a recruiter(Chief) and told him I wanted back in. He directed me to a prior service guy who kept telling me reserves reserves reserves. I wanted active so I went back to Chief and asked how to do it. He looked into it and as long as you have an ECM(Enlisted Community Manager) that will take you back active duty you can go. It has to be a Chief recruiter however and you do not need to be in the reserves to go active. It is a DRP not a DEP. So this means that as long as you have a chief who will do as much legwork as you will then it is possible. I am going to MEPS next week to re-enlist and then hopefully off to NAVVET in RTC in January. The key is only a Chief can write an active duty contract for a prior service applicant and it is like a 3 month process(longer for me because I had to get in standards). But it is worth being able to rejoin on an active duty contract. I owe everything to FCC Jones out of Jeff City Missouri for helping me with this process.
