You are a complete stranger.  Despite that fact, I can make a statement I guarantee is 100% true.   You deserve to be loved, you deserve to be happy, you deserve grace and kindness.  And I can say that with complete certainly because everyone does.  Every human deserves it.   It's the only reason we're alive.   If there is a God, they put us on this earth to love one another.   If there isn't a God and there is no reason why we're here, if we are just accidental stardust that learned to feel, then we are here to feel love.  \n\nSecond, the past doesn't exist.  It's fake.  It's not real.   The future doesn't exist either.  The only thing that exists, the only you there is, the you reading this is the you of right now.   You don't have to move passed your past mistakes because that's not you.   The you who made those mistakes literally doesn't exist.  Probably hasn't for months now, if not years.   Now, you certainly could make those mistakes again.   At that point in time, you'd be similar to that past you and making similar mistakes.   But you don't have to be.  You, right now you, can choose to the person you want to be.  Because that's what we are.  We are a series of choices.   And you can choose to be kind from now on.  You can choose to love and do good to others.  And eventually, that's just who you are.   \n\nYou do that by feeling and you do that by thinking.   In life, you're going to feel bad things.  And you have to just feel them.   There are nights I get very bitter about how my life has gone and I dwell on all the sadnesses and disappointments in my life.   You have do it sometimes.   You have to feel sad.  You have to feel angry.   You have to feel insecure.    If you don't let yourself, if you just bottle it up inside it will explode or it will destroy you from within.  \n\nBut how you feel and what you do are two different things.  You can always choose to be kind.  When you feel angry, you can still choose to be kind.   When you feel hopeless or alone, you can still choose to be kind.  When you are sad, no matter how deep your sadness is, you can choose to be kind.   And it's hard.  It's hard to be kind sometimes.  But it is a choice.  \n\nYou also have to know who you want to be and/or what you want to do.   Not exactly.  But you have to know what you want.  You need to know what you want so you can make the choices that get you there.  Things only happen when you do them.  Things don't happen accidentally, you have to put in the work and make them happen.   You have to choose to do those things. \n\nI'll tell you some things that I want to do.  I want to start a family.   I want to fall in love again and start a family.   That means I have to make enough money to support a family.   That means I have to find someone, ask them on a date, fall in love and have a healthy relationship, ask them to marry me, and then have children.    That only happens if I am someone worth marrying.   \n\nIn order to make that I happen I need to do the following.   I need to loose weight, I need to buy a house, which in turn means I need to make enough money to buy a house, I need become more social, I need to become more attractive, and I need to put myself into situations where I can meet strangers. \n\nAnother thing I want to do, or rather want to be able to do, is carry my spouse from the couch to the bed and tuck them in.   That only happens if I'm strong enough to lift and carry a human.  I cannot do that now.  That means I have to get stronger, which means I have to start working out.  \n\nLastly, I have always wanted to be able to breakdance.  I think breakdancing is awesome.  But the only way to be able to breakdance is to learn to do it.  \n\nThat's a lot of stuff I need to do.   But when I decided to do all this stuff I decided that's who I wanted to be in six years.   I am currently three years in and I don't know if I'm gonna make it, to be honest.    Boy oh boy is buying a house expensive and now is a terrible time to be trying.   Also, haven't started on getting strong enough to carry someone.   But I have lost a lot of weight.  I've changed my hair.  I'm trying to smile every time I pass through a door as a habit.   I want people to see me and think I look friendly or say \"oh, he has a nice smile.\" and that only happens when you smile.  I've tried to stop gossiping.  I fucking love petty gossip. \n But nothing kills someone's opinion of you like being known as a gossip.  I still hate people I found out were talking shit behind my back.  People's opinions once they judge you like that are very hard to change. \n I bought a terrible car and paid it off.   I have made progress. \n\nI've also failed.  In trying to loose weight I have started walking.  Three times a week I try and walk 4-6 miles.   I said that in 2022 I was going to complete (very slowly but complete) a half marathon and then in 2023 I would complete a full marathon!  That super did not happen.  And it could have.   I could have trained harder.  Nights where I didn't walk, I could have choose to do it and make it happen.  \n\nBut that's ok.  I'm still walking more than I did.  I am still closer to my goal than I was when I started.  I have made a ton of progress and there's still so much time left.  \n\nI spent the last three years thrifting and going to garage sales and I have a spreadsheet for everything I'll need when I buy a house.  Dishes, tools, linens, furniture, entertainment, etc.   I have all that stuff ready.  Took years but I have what I need.  Now I just need to find a place I can afford and buy it.  \n\nFrom there: I want to join a boxing gym and learn to box.  I figure I'm never going to lift weights on my own, if I joined an MMA gym or something like that, I can be peer pressured into getting stronger.  Also, being able to box is cool.   A lot of my hobbies are nerdy or artsy.   Also being a guy who can box I feel will round me out a bit.   Also a gym is a great place to meet men.   I'm also going to join a dancing studio and take lessons.  Can't learn to breakdance without a teacher.  And I figure it's a great place to meet women.  \n\nI'll own a house (condo in the city but same thing) and have a good job.  I've built a very stable life for myself.  I dance, I box, I paint, I write (roleplaying game scenarios, but it is writing) I play board games.   I'm social and meeting people.  Hopefully that's enough to find a relationship.   If not, I can always sit and think and make a new plan. \n\nYou have to think, not every day, but once in a while \"what do I need to do to get closer to being the person I want to be? How can I make sure I do those things?\"\n\nThat's who I want to be and that's how I'm planning on getting there.  You have to decide who you want to be.  Where you want to live.  What you want to do.  It doesn't matter what you choose, no matter how much effort it will take to make happen.  You have a long long time.   And every step count.   \n\nIf you smiled one more time tomorrow than you did today, you are closer to being that person.   Every time you choose to be kind one more time tomorrow than you did today, you are closer to being that person.  Every dollar you save, every book you read, every interactions you have from here on out  brings you closer to that person.   But you have to do it.    You can't do it if you aren't prepared.  So you have to make a plan and you have to do it. \n\nAnd I hope you do.  I hope you become the person you've always wanted to be.  I hope 10 years from now you live where you want and are surrounded by friends who love you.  I hope you are secure and life is stable.  And I hope you realize that you deserve it.  \n\nYou deserve that now.  As you are now, you deserve all those things.  But, in order to get there, you have to choose to do it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I don&amp;#39;t know anything about you.

I am currently three years in and I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m gonna make it, to be honest.    Boy oh boy is buying a house expensive and now is a terrible time to be trying.   Also, haven&amp;#39;t started on getting strong enough to carry someone.   But I have lost a lot of weight.  I&amp;#39;ve changed my hair.  I&amp;#39;m trying to smile every time I pass through a door as a habit.   I want people to see me and think I look friendly or say &amp;quot;oh, he has a nice smile.&amp;quot; and that only happens when you smile.  I&amp;#39;ve tried to stop gossiping.  I fucking love petty gossip. \n But nothing kills someone&amp;#39;s opinion of you like being known as a gossip.  I still hate people I found out were talking shit behind my back.  People&amp;#39;s opinions once they judge you like that are very hard to change. \n I bought a terrible car and paid it off.   I have made progress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also failed.  In trying to loose weight I have started walking.  Three times a week I try and walk 4-6 miles.   I said that in 2022 I was going to complete (very slowly but complete) a half marathon and then in 2023 I would complete a full marathon!  That super did not happen.  And it could have.   I could have trained harder.  Nights where I didn&amp;#39;t walk, I could have choose to do it and make it happen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s ok.  I&amp;#39;m still walking more than I did.  I am still closer to my goal than I was when I started.  I have made a ton of progress and there&amp;#39;s still so much time left.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spent the last three years thrifting and going to garage sales and I have a spreadsheet for everything I&amp;#39;ll need when I buy a house.  Dishes, tools, linens, furniture, entertainment, etc.   I have all that stuff ready.  Took years but I have what I need.  Now I just need to find a place I can afford and buy it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there: I want to join a boxing gym and learn to box.  I figure I&amp;#39;m never going to lift weights on my own, if I joined an MMA gym or something like that, I can be peer pressured into getting stronger.  Also, being able to box is cool.   A lot of my hobbies are nerdy or artsy.   Also being a guy who can box I feel will round me out a bit.   Also a gym is a great place to meet men.   I&amp;#39;m also going to join a dancing studio and take lessons.  Can&amp;#39;t learn to breakdance without a teacher.  And I figure it&amp;#39;s a great place to meet women.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll own a house (condo in the city but same thing) and have a good job.  I&amp;#39;ve built a very stable life for myself.  I dance, I box, I paint, I write (roleplaying game scenarios, but it is writing) I play board games.   I&amp;#39;m social and meeting people.  Hopefully that&amp;#39;s enough to find a relationship.   If not, I can always sit and think and make a new plan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to think, not every day, but once in a while &amp;quot;what do I need to do to get closer to being the person I want to be? How can I make sure I do those things?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s who I want to be and that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m planning on getting there.  You have to decide who you want to be.  Where you want to live.  What you want to do.  It doesn&amp;#39;t matter what you choose, no matter how much effort it will take to make happen.  You have a long long time.   And every step count.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you smiled one more time tomorrow than you did today, you are closer to being that person.   Every time you choose to be kind one more time tomorrow than you did today, you are closer to being that person.  Every dollar you save, every book you read, every interactions you have from here on out  brings you closer to that person.   But you have to do it.    You can&amp;#39;t do it if you aren&amp;#39;t prepared.  So you have to make a plan and you have to do it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I hope you do.  I hope you become the person you&amp;#39;ve always wanted to be.  I hope 10 years from now you live where you want and are surrounded by friends who love you.  I hope you are secure and life is stable.  And I hope you realize that you deserve it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You deserve that now.  As you are now, you deserve all those things.  But, in order to get there, you have to choose to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11n7zfy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Advice/comments/11n7zfy/how_can_i_feel_deserving_of_good_things/jbmni7c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11n7zfy/how_can_i_feel_deserving_of_good_things/", "name": "t1_jbmni7c", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Advice", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678418064.0, "created_utc": 1678418064.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11n7zfy/how_can_i_feel_deserving_of_good_things/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3epmj", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Maya Yukihi unleashes a brutal combo on Chris Brookes much to the delight of commentator Baliyan Akki.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "stardomjoshi", "link_author": "Quackhell2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbl8p57", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "lowkeyoh", "num_comments": 14, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbl7g12", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4plzi", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Where do you watch old Ice Ribbon matches?
