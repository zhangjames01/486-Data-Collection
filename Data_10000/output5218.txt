Lots of great stories that had me crying with laughter by the time I'd relay it to family, lots of terrible, head-ache induced ones, too. The person I have the most stories with though, is a middle aged woman I'll call \"Jess\". \n\nJess was one of the most difficult people to work with. She had a disorder called Polydipsia - Basically, if she saw a beverage she'd compulsively drink it. Literally anything. She can't control it, but at the same time she didn't want to. Well, she COULD control it if she really wanted to (AKA bribing her to do her favorite things) but often times it was a lost cause. She was EXTREMELY OCD as well as had Autism. She also had a terrible temper and would chase/hit/yell at people so many didn't want to work with her. I did well with her though, so I was always put on shifts with her because for some reason she really liked me.\n\nAnyway, the one time I considered punching someone in the face was when I was with Jess. She had an obligation to walk/do some kind of exercise once per day which she absolutely hated. However, she liked the mall a lot so I was able to convince her to walk with me for a half hour, and I would reward her by letting her look at magazines (She LOVED magazines). \n\nSo one day we're doing our walk when I hear some woman yelling after me \"EXCUSE me! EXCCUUSSEE me!\" I turned around, surprised and the woman at the kiosk comes storming up to me and Jess. \n\n\"Can I help you?\" I asked her. She looked from me to Jess, glaring at her as she did. \n\nShe explained to me that Jess had been there the day before which I knew wasn't possible because I had taken her to the YMCA to do Zumba. I tried to explain to her but she kept cutting me off. She told me it was at around one when Jess had come by their kiosk and stolen a drink that had been laying around. She had drank all of it and the woman wanted compensation for it for the employee Jess had taken it from. \n\nI hadn't been with her in the afternoon the day before so I turned to her and asked, \"Jess, were you at the Mall yesterday?\" she looked down and mumbled yes and told me she had been at her day \"job\" (Which is just at the center where she does crafts/whatever to occupy her time). \n\n\"What is that?!\" snapped the woman. I turned to her and gently explained what it was, that I was sorry this had happened, and informed her about Jess's condition. I also told her I was sorry but I hadn't brought money so if she wanted compensation we'd have to come back later. The woman sniped, \"Well YOU shouldn't have to pay for it!\" I agreed and told her Jess would pay for it out of her funds and that this was sort of common (this drink cost 2 fucking dollars - come ON lady!).\n\nThe lady looks away from me and starts badgering Jess, saying things like, \"You KNOW what you did!\" \"You did something BAD didn't you? HUH?\" and I was slowly getting angry so I jumped in, saying sharply, \"Ma'am, she is my participant and what you are doing is inappropriate. You do not know her condition. I understand you're upset but we will take care of it.\" The woman glares at me and goes back to berating Jess, talking to her like she's - well - mentally disabled and sub-human which anyone in the business can tell you is EXTREMELY rude and unnecessary. I figured she was treating me like an ignorant shit-head because I was young (only 21) so she probably thought she could take advantage of me and Jess.\n\nI was done the minute she said, \"Do you UNDERSTAND what I'm saying? Do you know ENGLISH?\" I move Jess aside, step in front of her and tell the woman, \"You know what? We're done here. You can get your money, but I won't condone you talking down to her anymore. Goodbye.\" I take Jess and we walk, the woman says something to our backs but I ignore her because I am about two seconds away from going ape shit on this ignorant bitch.\n\nSo we walk the mall some more and pass the woman a few times. She glares at us and starts talking shit to employees in other kiosks. She also points and laughs at us.\n\nSo the next day I called the company she worked for, made a huge stink about how someone that ignorant and shitty shouldn't be suited to work for the general public if she doesn't understand mental disabilities and treats people like monkeys (before I could give her name they said \"Oh, we know her and have gotten complaints in the past\") and the next week, she wasn't there anymore. \n\n**TL;DR** A shitty person yelled at my participant over a 2 dollar drink.\n\nA FUNNY story is one time while doing Zumba with Jess, I looked over at her, saw her plugging her nose and fanning her ass so I knew she farted and it must have smelled.
