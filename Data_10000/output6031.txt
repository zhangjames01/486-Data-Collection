Obviously the NPS and Federal Government have no interest applying the law this strictly for the average person not making any significant money from their technically illegal photography/videography. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is that there is no real middle ground between personal and what is consider commercial when it comes to NPS. So if some small time YouTuber wants to record footage for a video on just their smartphone on the deep wilderness (with a permit for backpacking of course), by themself, they would be treated the same as a massive corporation filming a documentary or something. The NPS requires liability insurance coverage (often times a minimum of $1,000,000), risk assessment, etc for all commercial operations. Obviously the work required to process all of this is vastly different between these scenarios, but BOTH would have to pay the $315 non-refundable application fee, applicable personnel fee, and possibly monitoring fees. This will obviously be a MASSIVE blocker for the YouTuber who will have the same impact as a normal backpacker, while larger companies are able to basically ignore the nominal costs for significantly more intrusive and damaging production.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_100l4is", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/100l4is/joshua_tree_national_park_will_be_implementing_a/j2kf3be/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/100l4is/joshua_tree_national_park_will_be_implementing_a/", "name": "t1_j2kf3be", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WildernessBackpacking", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1672617826.0, "created_utc": 1672617826.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/backpacking.htm"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rudk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Bought my first drone 4 days ago, then had the brilliant idea of leaving through the window (I live in the 8th floor)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 13, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "drones", "link_author": "ClimbingBear123", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j2inhcu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "sid34", "num_comments": 35, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_100mdvo", "score": 13, "author_fullname": "t2_fhw2f", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Looks like DJI Mini 2.

This is before any additional weight from passengers, stuff in the bed or backseat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The suspension may help reduce some of the weight redistricting, but it&amp;#39;s not going to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1236-1436lbs of payload (before added weight to the truck) is dangerous close to the 1450-1490lbs the truck is rated for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometime I WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT is the load index on your tires. The 2017 Ram 1500 Tradesman came stock with P or LT 265/70R17 that were likely just covering the max axle rating. Overloading this can increase your chance of a blowout. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that being said Ram and most other manufacturers underspec their payload a fair bit compared to what the actual axle manufacturer spec the axle at, but they do this for a few reasons, safety and legal issues, suspension degradation, etc. I am not sure what exact axle is being used on the 2017 Ram 1500, but it&amp;#39;s likely okay for a few extra hundred pounds over the payload Capacity as specified by RAM. I am not an expert and this is not advise to ignore the official specifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_z3a49t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/RVLiving/comments/z3a49t/upgraded_truck_springs_2017_ram_1500_it_drove/ixn2882/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLiving/comments/z3a49t/upgraded_truck_springs_2017_ram_1500_it_drove/", "name": "t1_ixn2882", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RVLiving", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1669314058.0, "created_utc": 1669314058.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/z3a49t"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0w", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Torrent won't download with USB tethering", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "torrents", "link_author": "infinityzcraft", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ixarx9g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "sid34", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ixanylw", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_fhw2f", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's possible that your ISP/Data Provider is throttle your connection based on protocol being used.
