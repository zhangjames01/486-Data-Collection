Fundamentally, that\u2019s what the yelling is, a defense mechanism. (at least for me. see my longer response to your post, i also have a reflexive yelling problem: &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vpq6ok/my_wife_feels_like_its_ok_to_yell_at_me_i_disagree/ielakhy/\"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vpq6ok/my_wife_feels_like_its_ok_to_yell_at_me_i_disagree/ielakhy/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so i totally understand the reaction of \u201cF you, i\u2019m not the problem, you\u2019re the problem because you can\u2019t handle the yelling.\u201d if my spouse came at me like this, I would also get defensive. telling me i\u2019m a problem feels like a \u201cholier than thou\u201d approach. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Research on developmental impacts of verbal abuse will not help. This is just hitting her over the head more with &amp;quot;you are a problem! why can&amp;#39;t you see it!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope that what I shared helps you approach her with more empathy, and that this helps you to work together collaboratively to break the cycle of yelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_vpq6ok", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/vpq6ok/my_wife_feels_like_its_ok_to_yell_at_me_i_disagree/ielc7fz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vpq6ok/my_wife_feels_like_its_ok_to_yell_at_me_i_disagree/", "name": "t1_ielc7fz", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationship_advice", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1656779017.0, "created_utc": 1656779017.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vpq6ok/my_wife_feels_like_its_ok_to_yell_at_me_i_disagree/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r0cn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "My wife feels like its ok to yell at me.

I don't think other people in the comments understand the problem and am saddened by how unempathetic the comments here largely are. \n----\nThis hits close to home. Both me + my spouse grew up in yelling homes, but we coped with it very differently. Similar to someone else in the comments, spouse vowed never to yell because they didn\u2019t like what they saw growing up and resolved to do better. But for me, yelling back at my parents was the only way I felt I could stand up for myself growing up. I don\u2019t yell much at my spouse but whenever I visit my parents\u2019 home, I suddenly yell a lot more. It is 100% a reflex. I feel like I\u2019m on autopilot when i go back to my childhood home; it is genuinely really hard to control the reflex. I will recognize what I\u2019m doing after the fact and apologize for it, but working to keep it from happening at all is a work in progress. Environmental triggers are a big thing for me - somehow the physical environment of my childhood home brings this out in me. Triggers can also be emotional (like if you are made to feel a certain way today, and if in the past you coped with this same feeling by yelling, then you might yell today without this being a conscious reaction). \n\n\nSTEPS TO FIXING:\nstep one to fixing this is to recognize that (a) this reflexive response is subconscious / somewhat out of the yelling person\u2019s control while it is happening, (b) that this response pattern is nevertheless changeable, and (c) that it is desirable to change it because of the externalities and hurt it creates for other people. I wanted to change because I don\u2019t think yelling is a healthy communication habit &amp; that it is more productive to talk things out; i don\u2019t like the person i am when i yell, but also i can\u2019t help it sometimes. \n\nThe next step is to recognize WHEN it is happening. say i have an uncontrolled outburst. sometime afterward, I will realize that i have yelled, and i will approach the person i yelled at and apologize for having done so. in the beginning, maybe I didn\u2019t recognize it was happening, and my spouse would have to approach me maybe a day later after I had cooled off to talk to me about it. over time, the latency between outburst and apology would get shorter \u2014 to hours, then to minutes. \n\nI\u2019m not at a point yet where the yelling never happens. but getting to a point of recognizing it is bad and apologizing for it is an achievable step. i think the third and final step is for the latency described above to drop down from minutes to seconds, and then instantaneously. Because what is happening between outburst and apology is a mental shift from \u201cmy body just did something I didn\u2019t feel like I could control\u201d to \u201ci am now aware of the thing I did and am in control of myself again.\u201d I think the answer is repetitive conditioning. If you can get to the point where the mental shift can happen instantaneously, then you\u2019ve effectively gotten rid of the reflex because maybe you can stop yourself just before the yelling actually begins. \n\nAnd/or, if you can find out what her triggers are, it is effective (at least for me) to remove the triggers. When i am not at my childhood home, it happens way less often. \n\n\nlastly, about the whole \u201cshe doesn\u2019t do it in public or around my family\u201d thing \u2014 this is totally a thing. it is the same for me. my theory is, everyone censors themselves more around \u201coutside people\u201d than they do with family. when you have a certain level of guard up (eg, when you\u2019re with \u201coutside people\u201d), you are at some level monitoring what you\u2019re saying and how you\u2019re acting, so you are 100% in the realm of your conscious self. But you drop your guard around family. This means that it\u2019s easier to slip into autopilot habits because your consciousness is not always \u201cactive\u201d to prevent this slip from happening. Note, autopilot habits can be positive, it can be exhausting to be \u201con\u201d all the time. This is all to say that the fact you are counted amongst the people that she yells at means that you are one of the few people in the world she can totally drop her guard around, and that\u2019s why this is happening. There was also a point during my now-spouse\u2019s transition from stranger to the single person that knows me the best before which i never yelled at all and after which they, like my family, became \u201celigible\u201d (pardon the facetiousness) to be yelled at. \n\n\n\nHow to move forward:\n\n1.\tre: step one above, it sounds like something is keeping her from being empathetic to you. Maybe her parents weren\u2019t empathetic to her when she protested their yelling as a kid. i would explore how your respective upbringings affected each of your communication styles and default assumptions. And/or maybe she feels dismissed by you not believing it is a reflex, and this makes her lean into this narrative more. This is not helpful because it allows her to hide behind the reflex instead of undertaking the very difficult effort of changing. If she is willing to change though, you also need to be patient because 20+ years of hardwired instinct is very hard to undo. \n\n2.\tI highly recommend the techniques suggested in the book \u201cNonviolent Communication\u201d\n\n3.\tYou should consider going to therapy together if talking it out on your own doesn\u2019t work.", "edited": 1656781463.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR - I have the same problem as your wife and proposed steps to help you both move forward.
