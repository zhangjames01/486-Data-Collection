The really significant ideas that I've learned have been from books and plain old experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally I would get a book in an area that I'm interested in and go off to some relaxing environmental if I had a week off. That said I'm sure there are seminars out there that will give you a chance to learn some new things.\n\n\nAnyhow you asked for the \"best programs\". This is a little hard to say since it really depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are. That said I'll give it a shot and name some well respected programs that I've gone though and give you my opinion on them\n\n\n\nBooks:\n\n*Feeling Good:The New mood Therapy* \nMy top pick. I found it to be invaluable in dealing with tough times, since I was making a choice that baffled many of my friends and family and needed to find the will to keep going in that direction even when I was constantly reminded of the easier(and less fulfilling) way  out. \nTo summarize it, it details a program to follow that will help you re frame negative thoughts into more inspiring and useful things. It's important to actually follow what the program says to do (only takes about 15min a day). I have given this book as a gift only to hear *it has some good ideas*. WTF? Do they read  personal fitness books only to say *running 20 min a day, sounds like a good idea* and then leave it at that?\n\n\nI'm getting off topic, point is it worked for me and follows the practices of one of the most effective forms of therapy known. \n\n\n*Getting Things Done*\nMost favorably reviewed organizational book in the market\n\n\nWhat's an organizational book doing in this list, you may ask. Well I personally found that when I really throw my self at a BIG projects I canlose my self in the small details. And often find my self forgetting things. You may say *i got a calender, what do I need this for*, well maybe you don't but I have found that when you're really doing your best you tend to block everything else out which can lead you things falling in the cracks. The peace of mind I get know knowing that all the lose my lose ends are in one place i s great. So is not waking up at midnight,sweating, suddenly remembering something that I has to be taken care of right then. Trust me, the more plates that are spinning in your life, the more you will benefit from this book.\n\n\n\n\n*The new Psycho-Cybernetics*\nAssuming you have read even the smallest bit of self help out there you know the importance of having goals. What's next you ask? If you read this and do what it says, it *will* make you into a more driven and motivated person. I can guarantee you that. When ever I feel like I down and need some inspiration to go on in the face of adversity (which is becoming a less common thing I can happily say), I pick up this or *Feeling Good* and doing some of the exercises they mention. It has helped me so much.\n\n\n\n\nAudio and video Tapes:\n\n\nTony Ribbons\nI'm going to go ahead and put tony ribbons into one category because that's what I did when I select tapes to hear. Basically I got an astounding amount of his work off the web and went thought is like a chain smoke going though packs, like a mad man. The irony of *stealing* work that was meant to help me reach a *more successful lifestyle* did not escape me.\n\n\n\nSo what do I think of all this? I have to say that there were many times while hearing or viewing a tape of his that I reached a level of inspiration and feelings of confidence that where unknown to me at that time. And I did accomplish some worthwhile feats. During the time I was on the program, that is. A few weeks later and I realized that I wasn't on that **I can do anything ** high so I went though another program, so on until some six months later I am sad to say that the most well known and respected motivation speaker did not make any lasting changing in my life. I know that sounds painful and results may very of course but I felt like I didn't' really get much out of this. Oh, and some parts of his programs were based on lies, not that I can blame him, how can one man be expected to know all their is to know about life?\n\n\n\nRichard Bandler tapes:\nCo-creater of NLP a very well known form of change therapy.\nSame as above. VERY motivational while listening, hell sometime I felt like crying, that's how moved I was by what he said but after a few weeks back to the same old. That said he does give some advice though out his tapes that I found I could follow (not like Tony that says *hang around rich people to become one yourself*, while it is actually sound advice it's not easy to put into practice) and I did learn somethings that thanks to his charismatic way of telling them I now, months later, still remember.He did say things that actually hindered my progress because I couldn't get his advice to work despite the confidence with witch he said this. So in my experience it's was a zero sum game.\n\n\nrandom note: Richard may very well be the most charismatic person I have ever heard speak.\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this leave us with? I found that after reading my three recommend books (and countless other self help books that were utter crap) the most helpful thing I did was set my self a few humble goals and work towards them. And during the work I saw what I read happen before my eyes, crystallizing in my mind the principles I had read about making it easier to do what I already knew was the right thing to do. Because despite what the amount of self help literature seems to imply, most of us already know what the best course of action is, we just have doubts about the effectiveness of those actions or our ability to do partake in that action. And the only way to really rid your self of those doubts is to go and do those things. \n\nWow, spent much more time answering your question than I thought I would. Well, that's it for now. If there are any questions feel free to ask, as I've gone through nearly every self help program in the market.\n\n\n\ntl;dr If you can't even get yourself to read though this, how will you find the initiative to succeed in your life?

So is not waking up at midnight,sweating, suddenly remembering something that I has to be taken care of right then. Trust me, the more plates that are spinning in your life, the more you will benefit from this book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Psycho-Cybernetics&lt;/em&gt;\nAssuming you have read even the smallest bit of self help out there you know the importance of having goals. What&amp;#39;s next you ask? If you read this and do what it says, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; make you into a more driven and motivated person. I can guarantee you that. When ever I feel like I down and need some inspiration to go on in the face of adversity (which is becoming a less common thing I can happily say), I pick up this or &lt;em&gt;Feeling Good&lt;/em&gt; and doing some of the exercises they mention. It has helped me so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Audio and video Tapes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tony Ribbons\nI&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and put tony ribbons into one category because that&amp;#39;s what I did when I select tapes to hear. Basically I got an astounding amount of his work off the web and went thought is like a chain smoke going though packs, like a mad man. The irony of &lt;em&gt;stealing&lt;/em&gt; work that was meant to help me reach a &lt;em&gt;more successful lifestyle&lt;/em&gt; did not escape me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do I think of all this? I have to say that there were many times while hearing or viewing a tape of his that I reached a level of inspiration and feelings of confidence that where unknown to me at that time. And I did accomplish some worthwhile feats. During the time I was on the program, that is. A few weeks later and I realized that I wasn&amp;#39;t on that *&lt;em&gt;I can do anything *&lt;/em&gt; high so I went though another program, so on until some six months later I am sad to say that the most well known and respected motivation speaker did not make any lasting changing in my life. I know that sounds painful and results may very of course but I felt like I didn&amp;#39;t&amp;#39; really get much out of this. Oh, and some parts of his programs were based on lies, not that I can blame him, how can one man be expected to know all their is to know about life?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Richard Bandler tapes:\nCo-creater of NLP a very well known form of change therapy.\nSame as above. VERY motivational while listening, hell sometime I felt like crying, that&amp;#39;s how moved I was by what he said but after a few weeks back to the same old. That said he does give some advice though out his tapes that I found I could follow (not like Tony that says &lt;em&gt;hang around rich people to become one yourself&lt;/em&gt;, while it is actually sound advice it&amp;#39;s not easy to put into practice) and I did learn somethings that thanks to his charismatic way of telling them I now, months later, still remember.He did say things that actually hindered my progress because I couldn&amp;#39;t get his advice to work despite the confidence with witch he said this. So in my experience it&amp;#39;s was a zero sum game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;random note: Richard may very well be the most charismatic person I have ever heard speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what does this leave us with? I found that after reading my three recommend books (and countless other self help books that were utter crap) the most helpful thing I did was set my self a few humble goals and work towards them. And during the work I saw what I read happen before my eyes, crystallizing in my mind the principles I had read about making it easier to do what I already knew was the right thing to do. Because despite what the amount of self help literature seems to imply, most of us already know what the best course of action is, we just have doubts about the effectiveness of those actions or our ability to do partake in that action. And the only way to really rid your self of those doubts is to go and do those things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow, spent much more time answering your question than I thought I would. Well, that&amp;#39;s it for now. If there are any questions feel free to ask, as I&amp;#39;ve gone through nearly every self help program in the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr If you can&amp;#39;t even get yourself to read though this, how will you find the initiative to succeed in your life? Will power is like a muscle, now go exercise that muscle by reading this!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_r02b5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/selfimprovement/comments/r02b5/who_are_the_best_successlife_coaches_what_are_the/c41vovg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/r02b5/who_are_the_best_successlife_coaches_what_are_the/", "name": "t1_c41vovg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/selfimprovement", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1331952479.0, "created_utc": 1331952479.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/r02b5/who_are_the_best_successlife_coaches_what_are_the/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh19", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How real people will use Windows 8", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "software", "link_author": "notadutchboy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c4179vk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "quenta", "num_comments": 117, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_c411675", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3fmdm", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I couldn't agree more.
