Then you can handle any one-time stuff like confirmation emails in that service. Now consider that we might want to import users from a CSV instead of self-registering. If all the email confirmation logic was in a callback in User, importing from a CSV would send confirmation emails to each user on create, so we&amp;#39;d have to disable that specific callback when creating them from import, but leave it in tact for creating from the web interface. With a service, it&amp;#39;s much easier: your User model is only responsible for persistence, so you can create a CsvUserImport class to create the User records and maybe even send a different email to them saying their account has been activated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that, plain old ruby objects are WAY easier to isolate from dependencies so that you can have proper unit tests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_59aajd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/rails/comments/59aajd/questions_about_fatmodel_skinnycontroller_best/d971azs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/59aajd/questions_about_fatmodel_skinnycontroller_best/", "name": "t1_d971azs", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rails", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1477405332.0, "created_utc": 1477405332.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/59aajd/questions_about_fatmodel_skinnycontroller_best/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh26", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How can I safely acquire equity from people I haven't worked with?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "startups", "link_author": "kelvinlaukl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d7o1b8g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ThePoopsmith", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_52wk5u", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3az28", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm assuming you mean that you want to be involved on the ground floor of a company that isn't making revenue yet, since once they are, they won't be near as interested in giving up equity.
