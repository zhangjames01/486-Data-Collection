I would not say that the library world (in general) is reluctant to embrace digital means of delivery.  About two-thirds of our scholarly journals are strictly electronic.  It's cheaper for us to get them this way and it's cheaper for publishers to deliver them this way.\n\nThe problem with the talk this guy gave is that it absolutely fails to address intellectual property.  Seriously, he barely mentions ownership at all.  The most he says is \"That's why copyright is such a bugger.\"  The fuck!?  Copyright is EVERYTHING right now.  It's why Google Books is being sued and stalled.  It's why the RIAA is aggressively suing grandmothers and teenagers for file sharing.  It's why universities have been sued for electronic reserve access to digital copies of textbooks.\n\nI don't disagree with the basic premise of the author's points - expanding access and availability - but copyright and intellectual property laws ARE the system.  Libraries work within that system.  Before libraries and their business models can be changed, at least in this regard, the rules of the system must be changed.  Right now, publishers are INCREASING their monopolies, not wanting to give away all of their publications for free.  Seriously, has anyone watched the mergers over the past few years?  Ebscohost just bought Wilson.  Just swallowed them up.  It's crazy.  \n\nAND, for the record, the web right now does NOT offer up free, scholarly, published research.  The web doesn't come close to offering quality data.  For high quality, peer-reviewed research, you need to pay (which is what database subscription fees do).  What's available for free online is not always to be trusted or considered reliable and we do teach our students that when instructing them in information literacy.  \n\nAnyway, just my two cents.  I do not consider libraries \"research monopolies\" and I'd argue that the author missed the forest for the trees.  Most studies are showing that people have no idea about just how much information is really out there and no means of really navigating it.  That's where librarians come in.

I would not say that the library world (in general) is reluctant to embrace digital means of delivery.  About two-thirds of our scholarly journals are strictly electronic.  It&amp;#39;s cheaper for us to get them this way and it&amp;#39;s cheaper for publishers to deliver them this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with the talk this guy gave is that it absolutely fails to address intellectual property.  Seriously, he barely mentions ownership at all.  The most he says is &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s why copyright is such a bugger.&amp;quot;  The fuck!?  Copyright is EVERYTHING right now.  It&amp;#39;s why Google Books is being sued and stalled.  It&amp;#39;s why the RIAA is aggressively suing grandmothers and teenagers for file sharing.  It&amp;#39;s why universities have been sued for electronic reserve access to digital copies of textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t disagree with the basic premise of the author&amp;#39;s points - expanding access and availability - but copyright and intellectual property laws ARE the system.  Libraries work within that system.  Before libraries and their business models can be changed, at least in this regard, the rules of the system must be changed.  Right now, publishers are INCREASING their monopolies, not wanting to give away all of their publications for free.  Seriously, has anyone watched the mergers over the past few years?  Ebscohost just bought Wilson.  Just swallowed them up.  It&amp;#39;s crazy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AND, for the record, the web right now does NOT offer up free, scholarly, published research.  The web doesn&amp;#39;t come close to offering quality data.  For high quality, peer-reviewed research, you need to pay (which is what database subscription fees do).  What&amp;#39;s available for free online is not always to be trusted or considered reliable and we do teach our students that when instructing them in information literacy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, just my two cents.  I do not consider libraries &amp;quot;research monopolies&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;d argue that the author missed the forest for the trees.  Most studies are showing that people have no idea about just how much information is really out there and no means of really navigating it.
