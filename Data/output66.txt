Then I found out that Hurlburt actually described that and called it \"unsymbolized thinking.\"\n\nSo this got me wondering. First, we know that there are people who can't consciously think visually (aphantasia). I am not a cognitive neuroscientist, but I believe that aphantasia doesn't mean that there isn't activity in the vision centers of the brain during thought, just that it's not accessible to consciousness, right? I don't think aphantasia is all that uncommon, either - about 1-5% of people as far as I've seen?\n\nSecond, we know that people with aphasia can still carry out reasoning tasks. So it's possible to THINK without being able to think VERBALLY.\n\nSo I don't think it's so ridiculous a question. Are there people who simply do not have conscious access to the parts of the brain responsible for inner speech in the same way that there are people without conscious access to the parts of the brain responsible for imagined images? I'm troubled by the assertion that it's \"obvious\" that everyone has this.\n\nI think there is good reason to be skeptical about Hurlburt, including his description of \"unsymbolized thinking\" and his descriptions of whether individuals do or do not possess inner monologue. But I also don't think it's been well-studied for precisely the reason that it's assumed to be obvious. What's more, I don't think that we can assume that someone who doesn't possess inner monologue *doesn't* \"think about things.\" Rather, (a) they may think about things using a different \"language\" such as visual imagery, or (b) they may think about things but not have conscious access to those thoughts; they just kind of \"appear\" fully formed to their consciousness with all the monologue going on behind the screen, or (c) something else entirely!\n\nFake edit: [Some more googling suggests that there are people for whom this is true!](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/inner-monologue-experience-science-1.5486969)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for commenting on a 3-year-old thread, but I was googling for an answer to the same question as OP and I found this thread somehow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was recently wondering about whether non-symbolic thought exists in verbal humans.
