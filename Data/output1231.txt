Please correct me and add any details if you know better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stylistic choice:&lt;/strong&gt; This one might be correct, but tbh it&amp;#39;s pretty idiotic on Game Freak&amp;#39;s part if it&amp;#39;s true. Pokemon is a super casual turn based RPG that is marketed towards small children with developing reading skills, adding voice acting would make the game and the story a LOT more accessible to the games target audience. Not having VAs might work for more traditional or hardcore RPGs, but Pokemon is neither of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laziness:&lt;/strong&gt; This one is probably true given Game Freak&amp;#39;s proven inability to even maintain very basic QOL features that people have loved such as the &amp;quot;Set mode&amp;quot; option for people that want more of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incompetence:&lt;/strong&gt; Also probably true because Game Freak&amp;#39;s sheer incompetence has been put on full display with it being known that the games horrible performance can be linked to the fact that the whole map is being rendered at all times which even to a novice like me is a very obvious big No No on a console like the switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, voice acting would be great and very feasible, but Game Freak is probably going to keep being Game Freak so I wouldn&amp;#39;t get my hopes up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_z5s81e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/pokemon/comments/z5s81e/why_doesnt_gamefreak_get_voice_actors/ixymkcu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/z5s81e/why_doesnt_gamefreak_get_voice_actors/", "name": "t1_ixymkcu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1669550555.0, "created_utc": 1669550555.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/z5s81e/why_doesnt_gamefreak_get_voice_actors/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5rp", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I know it's my own fault for going on Facebook but this really makes me worry for the human race.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "facepalm", "link_author": "PeculiarPete", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ixw8bg2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ghostnappa82", "num_comments": 2886, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_z4wxyf", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_b3d2a", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I can't tell if I'm being dumb or if a lot of the people in this thread aren't reading the part where he bought the SAME cow a second time for 100 more than he sold it for.
