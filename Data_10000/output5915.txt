Strahd summons the party to his castle for the final showdown, and they have an epic final battle.\n\nBut along that road several other linear paths branch out, especially in Vallaki, with certain hooks drawing the players down those paths. Several NPCs in Vallaki have tasks for the party to accomplish, which draws them to the other chapters of the book. \nKasimir leads them to the Amber Temple, the Martikovs lead them to the Winery, which itself leads to Berez and Yester Hill, and so on and so forth. \nThe best part is that as the DM you control these NPCs and determine their actions.

If you can start the session with them being in the room during the parley with the Baron, especially under the watchful eyes of several guards and Izek to dissuade a fight, that would be ideal.
