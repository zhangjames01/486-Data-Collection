You can&amp;#39;t buy furniture or medicine or books or anything for anything resembling &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot;, but hey, gas is cheap. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Oil is all they export. There&amp;#39;s nothing else. To make matters worse, they&amp;#39;re deep in debt and in the over-simplification of the century, &amp;quot;Their oil sucks&amp;quot;. (I&amp;#39;m not a petroleum engineer - I just trust the reports). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess their oil sucks to pull out of the ground and it&amp;#39;s even worse to refine. I found a source earlier (and lost it - thanks, Firefox) that Venezuela (and Iran), need oil to be at $100/barrel because they&amp;#39;re so deep in debt, that&amp;#39;s the only way they make money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t read up on them in a while, so take this with a salt shaker&amp;#39;s worth of salt, but if you&amp;#39;re looking for emerging economies to invest in (at high risk/high reward), try Mongolia and Botswana. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - Keep your dollars out of Venezuela. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2ujh2i", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/2ujh2i/any_way_to_capitalize_on_venezuela/co8y879/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/2ujh2i/any_way_to_capitalize_on_venezuela/", "name": "t1_co8y879", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/stocks", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1422903039.0, "created_utc": 1422903039.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/2ujh2i/any_way_to_capitalize_on_venezuela/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Good time to buy HA (Hawaiian Holdings)?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "investing", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "co69130", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "eatsnobananas", "num_comments": 2, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_2u7vpq", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_5mu6h", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "With a disclaimer that I'm new and don't know what I'm doing ...\n\n[Down 27%]\n(http://news.investors.com/013015-737147-hawaii-air-nose-dives-on-operating-revenue-warning.htm?ven=yahoocp&amp;src=aurlled&amp;ven=yahoo)\n\nSo they talk about revenue (per seat mile) dropping 3.5-6.5% and they're paying 13% more for fuel than American Airlines(shouldn't higher fuel costs already be factored into a Hawaii-based airliner?).
