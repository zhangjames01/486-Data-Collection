Less than a week ago, I pulled my back because she tried to \"help\" by grabbing something heavy I was trying to balance while up on a ladder, despite my repeatedly telling her to not touch it.\n\nAnyway, point being that as many other people have pointed out, it's not enough that Shawn \"feels terrible\" about what happened. You have every right to get angry, because like you said, this was totally avoidable if he'd just listened to you. You say that you're \"hoping this was enough of a shock to him that he learned his lesson\", but I'm not sure I believe that. People who feel this way generally still tend to hide behind a protective coating of \"but I was only trying to *heeeeeeellllllp*!\", as though their intentions excuse it. If you believe you want to stay with him (and frankly, you would be totally justified in ending the relationship over this), there needs to be a conversation had to drive the point home. You don't need to pander to his feelings or hide the fact that you're angry. If I were in this situation, I might start off by saying something along these lines:\n\n\"Shawn, I'm really, really upset at you and having trouble getting past it, because I can't trust that this won't happen again. This isn't the first time I've gotten hurt because you insisted on 'helping' when I specifically asked you not to. You've now seen that this is dangerous, but it's also extremely disrespectful and makes me feel like I can't trust you to listen to boundaries I set. I need you to explain to me why you feel that it's in any way okay to ignore me when I specifically ask you to stop doing something, because that's not something I can continue to live with in a significant other.\"\n\nDepending on what his \"explanation\" is (hopefully an acknowledgement that he's been an overbearing jackass and needs to change), you can proceed however you like. I'm not usually huge on ultimatums, but given that your physical health is on the line here, I think it would be worth telling him that if there's another incident where he pushes firm boundaries you've set, you intend on leaving him.

Less than a week ago, I pulled my back because she tried to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; by grabbing something heavy I was trying to balance while up on a ladder, despite my repeatedly telling her to not touch it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, point being that as many other people have pointed out, it&amp;#39;s not enough that Shawn &amp;quot;feels terrible&amp;quot; about what happened. You have every right to get angry, because like you said, this was totally avoidable if he&amp;#39;d just listened to you. You say that you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;hoping this was enough of a shock to him that he learned his lesson&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;m not sure I believe that. People who feel this way generally still tend to hide behind a protective coating of &amp;quot;but I was only trying to &lt;em&gt;heeeeeeellllllp&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;quot;, as though their intentions excuse it. If you believe you want to stay with him (and frankly, you would be totally justified in ending the relationship over this), there needs to be a conversation had to drive the point home. You don&amp;#39;t need to pander to his feelings or hide the fact that you&amp;#39;re angry. If I were in this situation, I might start off by saying something along these lines:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shawn, I&amp;#39;m really, really upset at you and having trouble getting past it, because I can&amp;#39;t trust that this won&amp;#39;t happen again. This isn&amp;#39;t the first time I&amp;#39;ve gotten hurt because you insisted on &amp;#39;helping&amp;#39; when I specifically asked you not to. You&amp;#39;ve now seen that this is dangerous, but it&amp;#39;s also extremely disrespectful and makes me feel like I can&amp;#39;t trust you to listen to boundaries I set.
