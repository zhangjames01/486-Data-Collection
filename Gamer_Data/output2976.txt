The story is pretty clich\u00e9 but with enough twists to keep it interesting. The characters are pretty well written, though some will get rather annoying at times. At least the characters have distinct personalities that make them interesting. You also have a fairy companion, a little crystal fairy. Although she is not as annoying as, e.g., Mieu from Tales of the Abyss, she will get on your nerves from time to time. \n\nThe party consists of four heroes, later also called \"Warriors of Light\". The first one is Tiz, who lost his little brother and his his home as a gigantic chasm that swallowed his tranquill village, Norende. \n\nThe second is Agn\u00e9s, the vestal of wind. vestals pray to the crystals of their corresponding element, fueling them with power. She sets off to save the day all on her own when the Wind crystal gets swallowed by darkness. She is accompanied by Airy, a little cute crystal fairy with a high pithced, annoying voice. \n\nThe third is Ringabel. He has amnesia and is a true casanova. He is in the possession of a peculiar book, \"D\u00b4s diary\", which seems to have written in it not the past, but future events.\n\nThe fourth is Edea. She is the youngest of the four and pupil of the legendary swordmaster, Kamiizumi. She is the daughter of the Grand Marshal of eternia. He and his army are the primary antagonists at the beginning of the game. Their cruelty towards the people of the counties they have invaded conviced Edea that what they are doing is wrong and so she joined Tiz, Agnes and Ringabel who seek to awaken the four crystals, which the army of Eternia wants to prevent for some reason.\n\nAs you can see, the story is pretty clich\u00e9. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed it as a nod to older final fantasy games, especially to my favourite, FFIII. It is rather long, but has a mindblowing twist towards the end. As the truth slowly uncovers in the last hours of the game the story just absorbed me.\n\nBD has a well made Job system which improves upon those of FFIII and FFV by introducing mechanics akin to the Tactics series. While performing one job, you can have the accquired supporting abilities of other jobs and even the primary abilites of one other job. You can have a Black Mage that can cast White Magic and has +10% TP equipped because you got the Monk to level x. Some combinations are better than other of course - Jobs alter your stats and therefore the impact of your various abilites. Still, it is a highly customizable system, and i like it.\n\nThe combat is old-school and turn based akin to FFI-III. The twist is the \"Brave and Default\" mechnic, which lets you \"borrow\" and store turns in the form if Brave Points. You start the fight with -1BP. At the start of each turn you get 1 BP, which gets spent on the action you take. You can however store this point by going into Default mode (a glorified guard option). You can choose Brave to spend up to four points in one turn. If you howver slip below -1, you will not be able to perform an action the next turn, as the BP you gain will not get you to 0BP.\n\nThe art direction and design is absolutely mind blowing. Sadly, the cities are pretty small. They are ususally one screen and you can\u00b4t even enter the shops. The door just opens and a menu pops up. You cannot enter any house at all (there are some exceptions, but these place are story relevant). This was rather disappointing first, but it isn\u00b4t that much of a problem honestly. In fact it makes the world just a little bit more realistic. You cannot just burst into other peoples houses like in most other rpgs - but we are so used to being able to loot their places that most would bother when playing Bravely Default.\n\nThe music is the best video game OST i have laid my ears on since ages. I will never get tired of listening to it. Never.\n\nThe only thing that really bothers me are the pointless micro-transactions. You can spend \"real world currency\" (they call it that in an IN GAME DIALOGUE. WHY. Breaks the immersion faster than a tutorial ever could) to accquire \"SP\" (or you could get one by having your game on standby.....for eight hours). In a fight you can then press start to pause it, making you the only one to be able to take action. One action per SP. It is a useless mechnic IMO, and i fail to see why they even included it.\n\nAlso, the street pass village... you get one resident per streetpass accquaintance that has Bravely Default (like you, on stand-by). I am a compulsive completionist and live in a country where JRPGs aren\u00b4t all that popular. And what if i lived in a small town? Would I ever be able to finish this village, with one Inhabitant/ 24/7-slave worker? When it takes 99 hours to get a damn boulder out of the way? Maybe not. I dislike it. It is not crucial to your progress or the flow thereof. It is just a gimmick. A gimmick i will never complete *sob*.\n\nTL;DR: Best jrpg i have played in a long time.

You can choose Brave to spend up to four points in one turn. If you howver slip below -1, you will not be able to perform an action the next turn, as the BP you gain will not get you to 0BP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The art direction and design is absolutely mind blowing. Sadly, the cities are pretty small. They are ususally one screen and you can\u00b4t even enter the shops. The door just opens and a menu pops up. You cannot enter any house at all (there are some exceptions, but these place are story relevant). This was rather disappointing first, but it isn\u00b4t that much of a problem honestly. In fact it makes the world just a little bit more realistic. You cannot just burst into other peoples houses like in most other rpgs - but we are so used to being able to loot their places that most would bother when playing Bravely Default.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The music is the best video game OST i have laid my ears on since ages. I will never get tired of listening to it. Never.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that really bothers me are the pointless micro-transactions. You can spend &amp;quot;real world currency&amp;quot; (they call it that in an IN GAME DIALOGUE. WHY. Breaks the immersion faster than a tutorial ever could) to accquire &amp;quot;SP&amp;quot; (or you could get one by having your game on standby.....for eight hours). In a fight you can then press start to pause it, making you the only one to be able to take action. One action per SP. It is a useless mechnic IMO, and i fail to see why they even included it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the street pass village... you get one resident per streetpass accquaintance that has Bravely Default (like you, on stand-by). I am a compulsive completionist and live in a country where JRPGs aren\u00b4t all that popular. And what if i lived in a small town? Would I ever be able to finish this village, with one Inhabitant/ 24/7-slave worker? When it takes 99 hours to get a damn boulder out of the way? Maybe not. I dislike it. It is not crucial to your progress or the flow thereof. It is just a gimmick. A gimmick i will never complete &lt;em&gt;sob&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Best jrpg i have played in a long time.
