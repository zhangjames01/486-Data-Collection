But the ground under the ring is a monotone brown color, and it is unlikely that you will ever have bright parts on the ground, so the refraction component is currently being wasted.\n\n\nWhat you need is a Reflective component. This reflective part comes from [glossy] shaders (there is also some glossy/reflection in the [glass] shader which is refraction+glossy).\n\n\nI would set up a glossy shader like this:\n\n\n    [LayerWeight]&lt;facing&gt; (blend:0.95) ---&gt; [invert] ---&gt; &lt;color&gt;[Glossy]\n\n\nThis will give you a reflective surface where the edges are black, and the center is white. Then Add this to [Refraction] with the [add] shader. This gives you some highlights from the sky to start building your lighting. For the refraction you can add two refraction nodes as you did, but you want to give them their own IOR.\n\n\nIf you do not want to adjust the thickness of the material for refraction, i suggest starting with an IOR of 1. Then look at something solid behind the crystal, like a cube, and slide one of the [Refraction] node's IOR lower, and the other higher. Real crystal has an IOR of 2, but EEVEE fakes a lot of things so the real values do not help much. Just slide the IORs slightly above and bellow to taste until you get some nice distortion. \n\n\n\nFor lighting, it looks like you have one area light in front of the ring. You probably also want one to the side to highlight the crystal more. Find an HDRI with sharp highlights (high contrasts between dark/light parts). This will help the ring's reflection become more complex and the refracted parts inside the gem will look more complex. \n\n\n-=-\n\n\nThe text probably needs bloom or glare post processing. If you have some, adjust the settings to better pick up the highlight or expand the radius. If you use [Glare] in compositing, you can export the text as a cryptomatte or AOV to isolate it if you want to give it more bloom without making the ring extra shiny. Then add it back on top of the original render. \n\n\n-----\n\nMight not be related, but at least with some limited testing in 3.3.1 , something funky is going one with refraction and the [glossy] node in EEVEE. It seems **refraction** on the shader is required to make it work??? Transparency also seems confusing, i'm not sure if it is more accurate or something is buggy.

Then Add this to [Refraction] with the [add] shader. This gives you some highlights from the sky to start building your lighting. For the refraction you can add two refraction nodes as you did, but you want to give them their own IOR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to adjust the thickness of the material for refraction, i suggest starting with an IOR of 1. Then look at something solid behind the crystal, like a cube, and slide one of the [Refraction] node&amp;#39;s IOR lower, and the other higher. Real crystal has an IOR of 2, but EEVEE fakes a lot of things so the real values do not help much. Just slide the IORs slightly above and bellow to taste until you get some nice distortion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For lighting, it looks like you have one area light in front of the ring. You probably also want one to the side to highlight the crystal more. Find an HDRI with sharp highlights (high contrasts between dark/light parts). This will help the ring&amp;#39;s reflection become more complex and the refracted parts inside the gem will look more complex. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-=-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The text probably needs bloom or glare post processing. If you have some, adjust the settings to better pick up the highlight or expand the radius. If you use [Glare] in compositing, you can export the text as a cryptomatte or AOV to isolate it if you want to give it more bloom without making the ring extra shiny. Then add it back on top of the original render. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might not be related, but at least with some limited testing in 3.3.1 , something funky is going one with refraction and the [glossy] node in EEVEE. It seems &lt;strong&gt;refraction&lt;/strong&gt; on the shader is required to make it work??? Transparency also seems confusing, i&amp;#39;m not sure if it is more accurate or something is buggy. Consider trying a version before 3.0 , this is the first time i&amp;#39;ve used refraction post 3.0 and things seem off. If the tutorial is somewhat old, maybe this is related to your experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_yg45yk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/blenderhelp/comments/yg45yk/months_of_tutorials_and_my_materials_basically/iu7nwh3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/blenderhelp/comments/yg45yk/months_of_tutorials_and_my_materials_basically/", "name": "t1_iu7nwh3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/blenderhelp", "author_flair_text": "BlenderHelp Helper", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1667018196.0, "created_utc": 1667018196.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/xsxob68drmw91.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t9eb", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How to retro style (like megaman legends) texturing ??", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "blenderhelp", "link_author": "Glad_Astronaut_654", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iu4j510", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "NeoRoshi", "num_comments": 2, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_yfkgqi", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_805qz", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hmmm... well it is pretty late, but i'll give it a shot.

If you are still lost you are welcome to ask, either me or someone else will hopefully help.\n\n\nTo setup your work space:\n\n\n1. go to 'texture paint' mode, add simple UVs (will change this later, needed to add a texture)\n2. Add a new texture 'Base Color'. for 'Generated Type' set 'UV Grid'\n3. go to 'Edit' mode, in the solid view options, change color from [Material] to [Texture].\n4. In the sidebar, under the [tools] tab, under 'options' enable '[x] UVs Live Unwrap'\n5. Split the viewport, and change one of the viewports to the UV editor.\n6. In the UV Editor go to 'UV'&gt;'Snap to pixels' and change it to [corner] from [disabled]\n7. In the Overlays, enable 'Display Stretch'. You can enable/disable it as needed.\n\n\nNow you can start to mark seams on your model and it should auto unwrap. \n\n\nWhat you are looking for at this point is a general texel density that is pretty even. Each UV Grid checkered square is 32pixels no matter how large the texture was that you generated, so you can use that to gauge how much detail each face can have from a texture. \n\n\nHow to unwrap is difficult to explain for all cases, but you will want to make seams as if something is a cylinder you are unwrapping (so cut off caps and cut along the length). You can also cut relief slits in sharper corners. You want your stretching to stay in the blue/cyan range, maybe only a little green. You also want to avoid hacking your shape too much if you plan to work externally where it will be difficult to match up edges.\n\n\nOnce the stretching and texel density looks generally good you are ready to transition your unwrap from mostly the '3D viewport' to mostly the 'UV Editor'. If you plan to paint externally, you will want to align your islands so they are mostly facing the same direction in your 2D map as they do in 3D so you are less confused.\n\n\nYou also want to do some alignment and possibly straightening, both of these can be found in the [w] context menu. If you select and edge and choose 'align auto' it will align to the x or y axis depending on which way it is more slanted. Try to align some of the outer edges of your islands so that they better align to pixels. In some cases you will have diagonals still but it can't be helped. Pin your outer island border and do an unwrap to relax your inner geometry if it gets too stretched. Again try to keep stretching under 'green' if possible, and align the boundaries as close to the x/y axis as possible, the internal edges of an island are less important for alignment.\n\n\nblender's texture painting is perfectly serviceable, especially for pixel art. You have a color picker, pallet. You will want to disable anti-aliasing in the 'image editor' brush settings under 'Advanced'. And For the 'Falloff' , move the right most curve handle to the center, add a dot above it. You want a sharp step where the left side of the curve is at the top , and the right side at the bottom. This will give you a minimum 1 pixel brush, instead of 2 pixels. You will want to mostly paint in the 'Image Editor' and not '3D viewport' for easier detailing and dithering.\n\n\nIn your shader, you can change the [image texture] node's interpoletation from [Linear] to [Closest] to give you sharp pixels.\n\n\nAnd that is pretty much it, You can stack UVs to conserve space if you have mirrored surfacess. If you started your model with the mirror modifier this can be done automatically for you, you will then only need to re-unwrap any islands you do not wish to stack. \n\n\nTry and leave 1 pixel bleed around the edges of your islands, mostly for diagonal edges.\n\n\nIf you plan to paint externally, you can export the UV map, but you will also just want to paint in a rough of where things are, then refine it in your external program. \n\n\n-=-\n\n\nYou can look up **256fes** models on sketchfab, use the inspector, set to 'base color' and '2D+3D' and color UVs in. This will give you a better idea of how others packed and unwrapped their work. You can click on the model or texture to see where both align. \n\n\nDon't expect your first model to go perfectly. You'll eventually get better at modeling so you have to make fewer relief slits, have more quads with less diagonals, and can more tightly pack everything in your UV map. This is in a lot of ways more difficult then working with more polygons and a larger texture where you can hide mistakes and stretching artifacts a little easier. \n\n\nGoodluck.\n\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT:** As a note, #256fes is not a style name, it is a challenge to build a model with under 256 tri, and with a texture that is 256x256. This approximates the type of lower poly pixelated style you presented as an example.
