And then I went down the rabbit hole about Scandinavia and noticed how Finland technically isn\u2019t in Scandinavia (but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Nordic). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I was looking up \u201cwhy isn\u2019t Finland in Scandinavia?\u201d and learned one of the reasons is that the language actually isn\u2019t that similar, despite Norway controlling the land for centuries and integrating its language and culture into the land that whole time. If the language &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; similar, it would be mutually intelligible with Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish. There are other reasons, too, why Finland isn\u2019t considered Scandinavia, but I was up til about 2am reading on this topic and remember how language was a big reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I wake up 5 hours later and see these comments from Norwegians talking about how they can understand Danish because the languages are similar. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My FBI agent was working overtime watching my browsing last night lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11hx03g", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/funny/comments/11hx03g/how_is_dutch_even_a_real_language/javs9dp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11hx03g/how_is_dutch_even_a_real_language/", "name": "t1_javs9dp", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funny", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677936657.0, "created_utc": 1677936657.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/1qnaih560rla1.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Sony might be forced to reveal how much it pays to keep games off Xbox Game Pass | The FTC case against Microsoft could unearth rare details on game industry exclusivity deals.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "technology", "link_author": "chrisdh79", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jat6io0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BoilerMaker11", "num_comments": 2460, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jat62wt", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_44xx2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You\u2019re right, my bad.
