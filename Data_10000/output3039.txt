Within this, I can branch out and make my final rating a little more sophisticated than a single number.\n\nFor example: a casual game that has been converted from mobile to PC.  I could score it a single score, but I think that since I do this and can call the shots, it would be unfair to the game if my opinion was a single number.

If you enjoy casual games, this would be a good impulse buy when it goes on sale, but I would save my money and not buy it right away\".\n\nYou simply don't get that kind of freedom giving a single number.\n\nThis boils down to the fact that since Metacritic goes based off of single numbers, it would be impossible for my reviews to get pushed up.  If they did, it would be on a scale of 1-3, and with the way many other reviewers do games, that would not work either.\n\nThen we have half numbers, which really puts the game not on a 10 point scale, but a 19 point scale.\n\nThe way it should work is that an average game, in your opinion, should have an average number.  What is the average in this situation? A 5.  Some bigger places have pushed that up to have the average be 6 or 7.  Not all of them do it, but they do it to the point where if a game is average, it could have a much higher, or lower, score than intended because many places do not put their average at an average number, which would be 5.\n\nSo, if a game is just below average and some give it a 4 while others give it a 6, a below average game could hit Metacritic at a 5 or even 6, which messes up the numbers.\n\nUnfortunately, until places adjust their scales, it will be tough to get a score on Metacritic that properly reflects how reviewers feel about it.\n\nPlaces like Metacritic also are all about the final number in a review.

The review itself is very important and the final number is far less meaningful without the bulk of information supporting that number.
