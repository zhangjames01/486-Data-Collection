At the time, it seemed the Canadian Forces reservist\u2019s turn toward conspiracy theories was relatively recent \u2014 potentially accelerated by the endless online hours of the COVID-19 lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the 46-year-old Manitoban\u2019s old personal website reviewed by the Star suggests Hurren \u2014 who was arrested near Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s residence on the Rideau Hall grounds, accused of carrying multiple firearms \u2014 was drawn to conspiracy-peddling websites and \u201calternative news\u201d outlets going back almost two decades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/corey-hurren-rideau-hall-plea-1.5902362\"&gt;&amp;quot;Data retrieved from his cellphone and social media accounts included exchanges with friends about &amp;quot;conspiracy theories related to the Canadian government&amp;quot; and COVID-19. He and a friend also talked about the mass shooting in Nova Scotia that April, speculating on a &amp;quot;sacrifice theory.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/corey-hurren-on-rideau-hall-attack-i-figured-as-soon-as-i-got-on-the-property-i-would-get-shot-down\"&gt;&amp;quot;Along with five loaded guns, he had spray paint with him. His first thought was to paint \u201cEvent 201\u201d on the side of his truck, he said. That speaks to his preoccupation. Shortly before his attack, he posted about Event 201 on social media. It is the name of a genuine pandemic simulation that has been twisted into a tenet of COVID conspiracy as proof the pandemic was planned by global elites. &lt;strong&gt;Hurren said the conspiracy theory \u201cindirectly aggravated\u201d his urge to attack.&lt;/strong&gt; It showed COVID was preventable, he said, which means all the misery it unleashed in his life didn\u2019t have to happen.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is well known from back when the attack happened. He literally said he was motivated by conspiracy theories spread through online communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null,
