My post was intended to highlight the contradiction in transgender ideology; they simultaneously claim gender and sex are separate (i.e. they can be different, and that isn't a problem) while also claiming that certain people with differing sex and gender absolutely cannot live without \"changing\" their sex to be in accordance with their gender.\n\nSince I have a bit of time, I'll explain what I think about gender and sex more clearly:\n\nThe words \"man\" and \"woman\", along with \"he\" and \"she\", have always been used to signify sex, not what proponents of transgenderism call \"gender\". No matter how masculine a girl appears, or how feminine a boy appears, we would never naturally change the words we use to describe them. However, \"Gender\" as it is currently used is a valid concept, in effect referring to certain personality traits that are typically associated with masculinity or femininity. This does not mean, however, that a man with a feminine gender is now or woman, or vice versa, since the terms \"man\" and \"woman\" are referring to biological sex.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being feminine as a man or masculine as a woman; subsequently, having intense negative feelings about these types of differing sex and gender is by definition a mental illness. Since there is nothing wrong with being a masculine woman or feminine man, and changing biological sex is actually impossible, feeling intense negative emotions regarding these completely normal, unchangeable facts constitutes a mental illness. Subsequently, any treatment should be focused on treating the mind of sufferers of gender dysphoria, not attempting the impossible (changing sex) to try and go along with their mental illness.\n\nThe only way the current treatment of gender dysphoria could be somewhat justified is if it were proven that there is such a thing as being born with a  \"male brain\" inside a \"female body\". There is basically no evidence that this is the case, and even if there was it is still debateable that surgically destroying genetalia to transform them into a practically unusable imitation of the genetalia of the opposite sex is actually an effective treatment. Even in this case, therapy might be the better form of treatment.\n\nFinally, I suggest you look at transgenderism through a philisophical lense. It's quite literally diametrically opposed to Objectivism.\n\nWhat does it say about metaphysics? Well, A might not be A - a man might be a woman, or indeed, he might be a combination of the two, a and non-a at the same time and in the same respect. Furthermore, it repudiates the idea of the primacy of existence - if your consciousness \"feels\" like that of a woman, existence be damned you ARE a woman.\n\nWaht does it say about epistemology? A woman is someone who identifies as a woman. Men can get pregnant. \"They\" can be a pronoun for individual people - all of this amounts to an assault on concepts as such. I've heard proponents of transgenderism ask, \"why do we have to put everything in boxes?\" Translated - why do we need orderly concepts?\n\nWhat does it say about ethics? You can be a hero simply by being a victim. You can be \"woman of the year\" as a mentally ill man cosplaying as a woman.
