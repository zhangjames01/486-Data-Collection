First-year students really have to grasp that the field they're entering *covers the whole thing*. It's all just code, all the way down to transistors, and we know how transistors work, and they work that way because people designed them to. And the code that runs on those transistors works the way it works because people wrote it that way, and the code built on top of that works because people wrote it that way, and so on all the way up to the present day and *you* writing code. So when you encounter something behaving \"randomly\" in your program: assume it's not random. Assume something, somewhere, is getting different input. \n\nIn theoretical CS, that assertion is really true. The theoretical Universal Turing Machine can't generate random output at all. Of course it can't, because you could run the same program with the same input a billion times and get the same output a billion times, no matter what. You'd have to attach an actual source of randomness if you wanted random output, and even then, it's really just serving as a new source of input.\n\nIn practice, computers have things like I/O lag and clock jitter that can introduce nondeterminism, and you can access that nondeterminism in code (you can even read it out of /dev/urandom). So physical computers *can* generate nondeterministic, irreproducible, \"real\" randomness.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they mean in first-year CS classes when they say &amp;quot;computers can&amp;#39;t generate random numbers&amp;quot; is actually &amp;quot;computers are deterministic&amp;quot;.
