He's fluctuated between touring musician, retail and audio engineering) we're constantly looking for ways to make things run smoother and extract the chaos from systems.  We're great at organizing and making systems work, we're currently living in a family home and going through family heirlooms while updating and caring for the property.  We seem to get into situations where it's like \"yeah, it would be great if someone could come in and clean and organize all this\" and we go \"hold my beer.\"\n\nNow, the pisces in me.. does things like, worry about killing plants in the yard as I'm caring for this family home.

Coming into a space that discusses a topic and then just being an ass and being like &amp;quot;change my mind&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t going to go over very well or yield you the kind of results and responses you&amp;#39;re looking for.  This space doesn&amp;#39;t exist to change every skeptics mind.  You&amp;#39;re asking others to do all the work FOR you.  It&amp;#39;s great to ask for links, guidance, recourses and have discussion, but it would be nice to see a little more respect for the belief of others.  I don&amp;#39;t care if you believe it or not, it&amp;#39;s not my problem and it&amp;#39;s not any one else&amp;#39;s problem either.  Pro tip: got through past posts and weed through comments.
