I&amp;#39;ll take a bike I CAN ride, over one that looks cool in the garage any day. Also it goes real fast... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buying a beginners bike isn&amp;#39;t just about learning the basics on an easy to ride bike. Sometimes your dream bike is uncomfortable, or just isn&amp;#39;t as fun as you hoped. So buy something that you&amp;#39;re ok with selling in a year, and ride the crap out of it. Learn how YOU ride, and what you really want out of a bike. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely not a Rebel if you want to go highway at all.

It is not much, but I will try my best to give you any answers I may have. They may be a bit rough, hard to hear, and I might go off topic, or too far. My mother passed just 10 days ago, July 8th 2017, after fighting a very similar fight for the past two years. She was 56. \n\nFirst, and this may be the most important of all the things I say here, this is all your mother's decision until she is no longer able to make decisions. Even if all she can do is nod \"yes\" or \"no\", it's still her decision to make. I don't know where you are in the process, or where she is in her ability, but you need to start having the hard talks if you haven't yet. Some things to talk about:\n\n*How aggressive of care she wants. Does she want the chemo? If it gets to the end point, will she want to be resuscitated/intubated? Antibiotics for pneumonia and other infections if she aspirates? At what point does the fight for survival end?\n\n*Does she have life insurance, power of attorney, living will all prepared?\n\n*Buried or cremated?\n\nThese are some of the hardest things you may ever have to talk about, and there is even more that I can't think of, but it's even harder to make these decisions yourself on the spot. I wasn't able to have these talks with my mom. \n\nSecondly the Oncologist is first and foremost a medical doctor. They will focus on what can make your mom better, no matter what. From my experience with my mother they will NEVER recommend against something that may help, even if it seems bleak. If your Oncologist is hinting at chemo being the wrong move, then it might be the wrong move. I firmly believe that general chemo and immunotherapy should only be used if there is a significant chance it could help, as it is the worst thing she, and you, can experience. It is the first in a long line of incredibly hard decisions, and its a choice that no one should take lightly. This is the moment you decide whether to keep fighting, or start fully preparing for the end. I would highly suggest talking to your primary care facilities bereavement team if they have one. The doctors are there to heal, the bereavement team is there to help you when your loved ones can't be healed. They may be able to give you a more straight answer on her condition and time left. If you're facility doesn't have one, or they can't comment then lean on your doctor a bit heavier for those hard answers. I'm sorry I can't say more.\n\nAnother thing to think about, which took me and my sister completely off guard, is what her health insurance covers/doesn't cover. I don't know where you live, or what kind of healthcare your mom has, but my mom's health insurance only covered care if it was to help her get better. Anything after the choice to focus on end-of-life instead of recovery was not covered. Being prepared for the worst, is the best thing you can do.\n\nFinally, talk to her. When she is awake ask her what she wants to do. If she wants to be awake more, talk to the doctor on why she sleeps so much. If she says she just wants to sleep, talk to her and her doctor about depression. Talk to her about any regrets you have, or she has. Talk to her about being ready for the end. Talk to her about that boy/girl you think is cute. Just talk to her for as long as you can. A month before my mom left she had a seizure leaving her completely nonverbal. The last few days she was awake only for a few hours a day, and lucid for less than half of that time. During one of those fleeting moments I laid everything out that I could, and it was the most wonderful moments I ever had with my mother. I love her so much, and this is the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with in my life. I would trade anything for one more conversation. Don't leave anything unsaid.\n\nThis might be rambly, and I talked about a lot of things you didn't ask for but this is all the stuff I could think of. There are probably other places that might give you better answers, but this is all from my personal experience. It's still really hard to talk about but if you have any specific questions, feel free to PM me or reply here and I'll answer as best as I can.\n\n\n\nOne more thing, she may be the one with the cancer, but this is also happening to you. It sounds terrible, but you need to take care of yourself. No one can do this on their own. Don't neglect your friends and family. They will be your support when you most need it.\n\nEdit: Thank you whoever you are for the gold.

It is not much, but I will try my best to give you any answers I may have. They may be a bit rough, hard to hear, and I might go off topic, or too far. My mother passed just 10 days ago, July 8th 2017, after fighting a very similar fight for the past two years. She was 56. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, and this may be the most important of all the things I say here, this is all your mother&amp;#39;s decision until she is no longer able to make decisions. Even if all she can do is nod &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s still her decision to make. I don&amp;#39;t know where you are in the process, or where she is in her ability, but you need to start having the hard talks if you haven&amp;#39;t yet. Some things to talk about:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*How aggressive of care she wants. Does she want the chemo? If it gets to the end point, will she want to be resuscitated/intubated? Antibiotics for pneumonia and other infections if she aspirates? At what point does the fight for survival end?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Does she have life insurance, power of attorney, living will all prepared?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Buried or cremated?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are some of the hardest things you may ever have to talk about, and there is even more that I can&amp;#39;t think of, but it&amp;#39;s even harder to make these decisions yourself on the spot. I wasn&amp;#39;t able to have these talks with my mom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly the Oncologist is first and foremost a medical doctor. They will focus on what can make your mom better, no matter what. From my experience with my mother they will NEVER recommend against something that may help, even if it seems bleak.
