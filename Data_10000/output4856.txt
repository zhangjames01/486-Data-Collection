You can't beat that with the command line. \n\nAnd, once you have to **merge** ... you'll want a more powerful view on things than you're going to get from command-line tools. Of course, it's _possible_ to merge on the command-line! I'm just saying it's more error-prone and not as efficient -- especially for most developers. There are probably a couple of [John Henrys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)) out there, but c'mon.\n\nIt's great that the command-line exists! It allows us to build UIs on top of it. It allows us to integrate anything we'd like into a headless process like CI/CD.\n\nHowever, you're going to be more efficient with a good GUI. There are pros/cons to the various UIs.
