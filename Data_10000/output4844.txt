The combat is absolutely incredible, though it takes so long to actually break it down and understand it, and the game itself does very little to assist in that process. An external guide being almost necessary material to the game is an issue that most seem to let slide (even though it is possible to understand without, as I did on release). That said, the system of building up arts, then specials, then orbs, then launching into a chain attack capable of melting a superboss's entire health bar is something that's not really been replicated anywhere to this effect. The world is absolutely gorgeous and a joy to explore. Aside from that, everyone's usual complaints to the game apply (everything else to do with the Blade system, really; the core concept of a gacha system, how annoying core crystals were to open on launch, field checks, inconsistent art style, inconsistent English voice direction). But the biggest issue the game has is its horribly slow start. From the top, the story goes much of nowhere, the game's great characters are either MIA or closed off, and the best parts of the combat system won't be accessible for another ~15 hours of casual gameplay. The story and characters do improve though, and at such a consistent rate that it's unlike anything I've seen in a game before or since. For it to start out at its lowest point and end at its highest after a full game of building up story and characters is incredible to see, and I think that's part of why several consider it to be the best.

With the more annoying parts of 2's gameplay gone, Torna's admittedly simple yet engrossing tale of doomed heroes really gets to shine.

My favorite parts of this series are the stories and characters, yet X puts all of its chips on the open world exploration, leaving in its place a forgettable story and just-okay main party (side party members not-withstanding since Lin and Elma are required for every story mission and enough side content to make leaving them inconvenient). That's not inherently bad thing, it's just very different. World and music are so good, combat is so good, everything else is just kind of there. Except Tatsu, whom I hate.
