I can tell you how *I* tend to do it, particularly in Star Wars, but that's likely not the \"best\" kind of anything. Also, I should point out that writing an adventure for a group that you *know* is completely different from writing an adventure to be published, or to play at a convention where you likely *don't* know anybody at the table.\n\nIn the first instance, you can tailor the circumstances to be particularly meaningful for your players; in the second instance, you need to make sure your text is much more complete in order to handle the diverse players and possibly unknown player characters. (Most conventions use pregenerated characters, so at least you have that.)\n\nIf you consider an adventure, a module, a scenario, or whatever you decide to call it, it consists of one or more game sessions. An adventure path consists of several linked adventures. So however you slice it, the game *session* is the unit of measurement here. Sure, each session consists of several encounters, but rarely is one encounter the entire session. Which leads me to discuss sessions.\n\n---\n\n**The Generic Session**\n\nI tend to consider a gaming session as having a set of several types of encounters. I like to have one or two combat encounters, one or two social encounters, one or two skill challenges, maybe a puzzle, maybe a chase scene, and preferably a few handouts to help with verisimilitude. Preferably, I try to bait adventure hooks so that I always have a couple of adventure hooks (things that may lead to future adventures) that the group's seen and heard, and may have shown interest in *before* we finish whatever we're doing.\n\nAn adventure can stretch over several sessions; in that case, I tend to rework the adventure as play progresses so that I make sure I have something to do in the sessions. I also tend to try and mix up the skill challenges in order to allow various player characters to shine, and I try to make puzzles only enrich the plot, not completely determine the plot. \n\nPuzzles tend to be quite metagame dependant. In a very real sense, you're playing the *players* rather than the player characters. In skill challenges - e.g. climb a wall, repair a droid, slice a computer system - you're allowing the player to narrate how their character solve the problem... but you're rolling the *character's* skill. This is not so with puzzles.\n\nIn puzzles, you're challenging your *players*. Their *characters* might be ultra-wise alien students of the Force, or a towering, cybernetic tank of death (like D'harhan), and so might be uniquely qualified to solve the puzzle if it was put in front of the characters. However, you're putting the puzzle in front of the *players*, so the *players* must solve it.\n\nBecause of this, I tend to make it so that puzzles only enrich the plot. The players get an advantage if they solve it - or a *disadvantage* if they fail to solve it - but they're not *stuck* in the plot. Maybe they get an item, or extra information, or they can go a different route to their objective... but if they fail, they can still complete whatever objective they're after. It just gets harder, that's all.\n\n**For Star Wars in particular**, I try to have at least one encounter or scene that calls back to the movies, or more rarely the tv shows (whichever). A combat encounter that starts in a dark corridor, where suddenly the player characters hear the distinctive snap-hiss and humming of a lightsaber being activated. Maybe there's even some crimson light spilling out around a bend in the corridor.\n\nOr perhaps one player character is desperately trying to get their starfighter into position to launch proton missiles or attack a thermal regulator - while the others are trying to hold off the TIE fighters. Or there's a retracted bridge that must be swung over. Talking to a crime lord. Doesn't matter what - but I try to include one such scene in every session.\n\nIn addition to that, there's a few peculiarities distinct for Star Wars.\n\n---\n\n**For WEG Star Wars in particular**\n\nIf you look through the various adventures published, for instance from WEG, or through the Adventurer's Journal, or anywhere else, you'll see a few things that are uncommon in published adventures for other systems. One thing in particular that is unusual, is the opening script - not only in the beginning of the adventure, but potentially linking encounters within the adventure, as well as concluding the adventure or even setting the stage for the next adventure.\n\nStar Wars is often quite episodic. Some adventure writers decided that this should be done explicitly, and so decided to include the opening script. You're meant to assign roles to the players in your group, and have them read their lines in character - with you (as the GM) usually supplying any extra droid voices and so on. It allows the adventure to start *in medias res* - basically, you're already in the thick of things.\n\nThis plays back to the pulp roots of Star Wars, for instance in old Flash Gordon serials, where the opening scene shows the protagonists already on the mission - rather than playing through the protagonists getting the mission or preparing for the mission.\n\n---\n\nSo now I've covered how I think about a game session, what I usually try to fill a game session with, and how WEG tended to start their published adventures. That, however, doesn't help with the adventure itself.\n\n**What's the Problem, and Why Is It A Problem?**\n\nBasically, almost all adventures end up with someone wanting something, and having difficulty getting it. Whether it is a thing, or achieving an action, or whatever, doesn't matter. I tend to get inspiration from either subreddits like the Imaginary Network, or by browsing deviantART or Artstation - I'm fairly visual. I might find an illustration that makes me think, \"huh, that's a good villain\", and then I start speculating about that character - who are they, what motivates them, what skills do they have, and how will they end up being at loggerheads with the player characters?\n\nSometimes, I get ideas from comics (often Star Wars comics), or I might get ideas from tv shows, movies, or whatever. Often, it helps if the movie is particularly bad - 1980s and 1990s action movies can have characters and plots I can rip off with ease, because they're so caricatured that they're easy to use.\n\nOther times, I start with the end scene - for instance, I know that I want one player character to end up racing a prototype starfighter to a precalculated jump point while dodging enemy starfighters, and the other player characters to run interference, trying to shoot down the enemy starfighters as well as getting away themselves. Then, I start asking myself *how*, *why*, and *where* - how did they end up there, why are they there, and where are they, exactly?\n\nAnd then again I might sit down and just brainstorm various problems that the players might get their characters embroiled in. That list might end up something like:\n\n* Fix a droid - but the droid is rare or so damaged that only a legendary character like Kligson can help them.\n\n* Steal a prototype starfighter - or steal *back* a prototype starfighter.\n\n* Encounter an Imperial Inquisitor looking for a Force-sensitive child.\n\n* Hired to travel a hidden hyperspace route looking for something - perhaps a Force artifact, a lost colony, a Sith tomb, a cache of Xim war droids, or a Krath artifact, or maybe a Sith Meditation Sphere?\n\n* Defend a wounded alien - maybe Trandoshan, maybe Abyssin, maybe something else - from others looking to main or kill the alien.\n\n* Find a crashed Chiss Ascendancy ship and destroy its navcomputer core - on a planet that is currently at war.\n\nI then start looking for ways to hook the players and their characters. If there's NPCs the players like, maybe this is really the *NPC*s problem, and the players get entangled trying to help their friend. Maybe there's a reward. Maybe it links to something that the players *really* want to solve or find, like a lost cache of lightsabers under Ood Bnar, or something else. This is my opening scene.\n\nThen, I start filling in the other encounters, while looking for that \"Star Wars moment\". Will a social encounter end up being like Han and Greedo in the cantina? Will there be a chase? Is there a combat encounter like with the bunker on Endor, or even one where primitive weapons carry the day like the Ewoks vs the Empire? And so on and so forth.\n\nOnce I'm done with that, I make sure that I have several links between my encounters, and try to handle various ways I anticipate my players may decide to follow something else.\n\nHowever, ultimately, your adventure is just a plan. And no plan survives contact with reality - in this case, the players. Listen to your table, and be ready to just wing it if whatever your players suggest sounds better than what you've prepared.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t tell you what the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; way is to write an adventure - or an adventure outline, for that matter.

It allows the adventure to start &lt;em&gt;in medias res&lt;/em&gt; - basically, you&amp;#39;re already in the thick of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This plays back to the pulp roots of Star Wars, for instance in old Flash Gordon serials, where the opening scene shows the protagonists already on the mission - rather than playing through the protagonists getting the mission or preparing for the mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;ve covered how I think about a game session, what I usually try to fill a game session with, and how WEG tended to start their published adventures. That, however, doesn&amp;#39;t help with the adventure itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s the Problem, and Why Is It A Problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, almost all adventures end up with someone wanting something, and having difficulty getting it. Whether it is a thing, or achieving an action, or whatever, doesn&amp;#39;t matter. I tend to get inspiration from either subreddits like the Imaginary Network, or by browsing deviantART or Artstation - I&amp;#39;m fairly visual. I might find an illustration that makes me think, &amp;quot;huh, that&amp;#39;s a good villain&amp;quot;, and then I start speculating about that character - who are they, what motivates them, what skills do they have, and how will they end up being at loggerheads with the player characters?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I get ideas from comics (often Star Wars comics), or I might get ideas from tv shows, movies, or whatever. Often, it helps if the movie is particularly bad - 1980s and 1990s action movies can have characters and plots I can rip off with ease, because they&amp;#39;re so caricatured that they&amp;#39;re easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other times, I start with the end scene - for instance, I know that I want one player character to end up racing a prototype starfighter to a precalculated jump point while dodging enemy starfighters, and the other player characters to run interference, trying to shoot down the enemy starfighters as well as getting away themselves. Then, I start asking myself &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; - how did they end up there, why are they there, and where are they, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then again I might sit down and just brainstorm various problems that the players might get their characters embroiled in. That list might end up something like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fix a droid - but the droid is rare or so damaged that only a legendary character like Kligson can help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steal a prototype starfighter - or steal &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; a prototype starfighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encounter an Imperial Inquisitor looking for a Force-sensitive child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hired to travel a hidden hyperspace route looking for something - perhaps a Force artifact, a lost colony, a Sith tomb, a cache of Xim war droids, or a Krath artifact, or maybe a Sith Meditation Sphere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defend a wounded alien - maybe Trandoshan, maybe Abyssin, maybe something else - from others looking to main or kill the alien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a crashed Chiss Ascendancy ship and destroy its navcomputer core - on a planet that is currently at war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then start looking for ways to hook the players and their characters. If there&amp;#39;s NPCs the players like, maybe this is really the &lt;em&gt;NPC&lt;/em&gt;s problem, and the players get entangled trying to help their friend. Maybe there&amp;#39;s a reward. Maybe it links to something that the players &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to solve or find, like a lost cache of lightsabers under Ood Bnar, or something else. This is my opening scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, I start filling in the other encounters, while looking for that &amp;quot;Star Wars moment&amp;quot;. Will a social encounter end up being like Han and Greedo in the cantina? Will there be a chase? Is there a combat encounter like with the bunker on Endor, or even one where primitive weapons carry the day like the Ewoks vs the Empire? And so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I&amp;#39;m done with that, I make sure that I have several links between my encounters, and try to handle various ways I anticipate my players may decide to follow something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, ultimately, your adventure is just a plan. And no plan survives contact with reality - in this case, the players. Listen to your table, and be ready to just wing it if whatever your players suggest sounds better than what you&amp;#39;ve prepared.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_apuwfm", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/StarWarsD6/comments/apuwfm/how_to_write_adventures/egbu83t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsD6/comments/apuwfm/how_to_write_adventures/", "name": "t1_egbu83t", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StarWarsD6", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1550001250.0, "created_utc": 1550001250.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsD6/comments/apuwfm/how_to_write_adventures/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wpra", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "PC: The Professional Starship Pilot - a template and a sample player character", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "StarWarsD6", "link_author": "SenseiZarn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "egajtev", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SenseiZarn", "num_comments": 9, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ega4fqv", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_h1kl9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Also in 1e, there's alien attribute blocks that both break 4D and goes under 2D. 1e GG4: Aliens has examples of that.

And, my answer is quite short and simple: *Don't worry (too much) about it*.\n\n*Star Wars* is an intellectual property that has gone through a couple of reboots and retcons, has a large collection of comics, novels, movies, series, radioplays, audiobooks, computer games, board games, card games, and what have you. There's simply too much for any one person to keep everything in their head at one time.\n\n*Pablo Hidalgo* is likely the one person on Earth that knows the most about the expanded universe, both Disney and pre-Disney, and whichever level of canon there was in pre-Disney EU, bar *none*. He's spent a large part of his professional life collating and fact-checking as many snippets of information as he can when it comes to Star Wars... and he's paid for doing so. Together with Leland Chee and Kiri Hart and possibly some others, he's had the task of keeping the canon post-2014 and the partial reboot that happened in the Disney canon.\n\nBut *you're* not Pablo Hidalgo. And that is exactly *how* it should be. Without getting too Yoda on you, you should always strive to be yourself rather than somebody else. (With the possible exception of being Batman. *Everyone* should be Batman whenever they can.)\n\n*You* decide what your canon is. And you can - and to a certain extent, *should* - tell your players exactly what your level of canon is. I tend to go for the classic trilogy - ANH, ESB, and ROTJ are all canon, and all the events there either *will* happen, or *have* already happened. I would likely add *Rogue One* to that list, and maybe the prequels.\n\nI would tend to disregard TFA and TLJ - either they haven't happened *yet*, or they never *will* happen. I do that simply because it gives me the greatest narrative freedom the way I see it, *and* people will have tended to have seen the Star Wars *movies*, even if they're not particularly invested in the rest of the Extended Universe (comics, games, what have you).\n\nIf I were to give you a set of steps to define the scope of your own canon, here's how I would do it.\n\n**Decide your era**.\n\n*Is it in the Old Republic era* (KOTOR, KOTOR 2, The Old Republic), some 4000 years BBY? Well, you can get all sorts of art assets, plot lines, and NPCs from the games or the MMORPG, as well as the Golden Era comics.\n\n*Is it about 0 ABY*, at or around the first Death Star? Has the events of the first movie happened yet? You can still be off in the Corporate Sector, or in some sector of your own choosing, but in this era any Rebels will be hunted by the overwhelming might of the Empire.\n\n*Is it just after the second Death Star, about 5 ABY*? This is my favorite time. The Emperor has been seemingly destroyed, Darth Vader has died, and the Rebels are transforming from the Alliance to Restore the Republic into the New Republic. However, there's still a lot of Empire factions jockeying for position, there's the Pentastar Alignment, there's the Tapani Sector (Lords of the Expanse), and so on. The Empire is falling apart - but still dangerous.\n\nAlso, people only need to have watched the movies in order to have a handle of how things work. They've been introduced to Hutts, they've seen bounty hunters, droids of all sorts, they have heard the howl of TIE fighters, and so on. You're on familiar ground here. If you say, \"he's flying a jet black Y-Wing with gold trims, and the turret looks upgraded\", everyone will be able to know how a Y-Wing looks and behaves.\n\nIs it in the far future? The [*Star Wars Legacy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Legacy) era comic books are some 130 years ABY. There's all sorts of stuff going on there, and if you set it here, there's the familiar-but-different vibe going on.\n\n**Decide how true the movies are**.\n\nAgain, the movies are a common touchstone for the Star Wars universe, and can help you with providing a shorthand for describing things. \"She's a Hutt, like Jabba the Hutt\" sort of thing. However, be explicit as to how true the movies are. If you're running around ~4,000 BBY, just use whatever you want without worrying too much about the movies. Exar Kun, Ulic Qel-Droma, Nomi Sunrider, Master Vodo Baas, all of the others are NPCs you can decide to use, or skip. Nobody knows what the true canon for Gree, or for the Kwa, or whatever is. So just go wild here.\n\nIf you're running about 0 ABY, you might want to make Rogue One true, but leave the others ambiguous. Or even state flatly that the Empire will win - unless the player characters manage to do something about it. If they end up *being* the team that did what the Rogue One team did - i.e. getting the Death Star plans from wherever Poggle the Lesser stashed them and to the Bothan spy team - that might be a nice surprise to crown a campaign here.\n\nIf you're running about 5 ABY, the three classic movies should likely be true, and you might want to say so explicitly. In a cameo with Luke, or Princess Leia, or any of the others, they should look and act much like they did in ROTJ.\n\n**Decide what else is true**.\n\nIf you all have read *Dark Empire*, *Crimson Empire*, seen everything in the *Clone Wars* series (either one), or even *Droids*, decide what is true. Even if the characters found in the EU might exist in *your* EU, none of the events may have happened yet - or never will happen.\n\nYou might state it explicitly to your gang - \"I'm disregarding everything but the three classic movies, and Rogue One. Everything else might or might not be true, but I don't feel bound to it by any means.\" Or, perhaps \"None of the movies are true. It'll be up to *your characters* to defeat the Empire, and maybe restore the Republic / the Mandalorians / the Krath by doing so.\"\n\n---\n\ntl;dr - Decide *when* you start, then go from there.

In a cameo with Luke, or Princess Leia, or any of the others, they should look and act much like they did in ROTJ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide what else is true&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you all have read &lt;em&gt;Dark Empire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Crimson Empire&lt;/em&gt;, seen everything in the &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; series (either one), or even &lt;em&gt;Droids&lt;/em&gt;, decide what is true. Even if the characters found in the EU might exist in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; EU, none of the events may have happened yet - or never will happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might state it explicitly to your gang - &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m disregarding everything but the three classic movies, and Rogue One. Everything else might or might not be true, but I don&amp;#39;t feel bound to it by any means.&amp;quot; Or, perhaps &amp;quot;None of the movies are true. It&amp;#39;ll be up to &lt;em&gt;your characters&lt;/em&gt; to defeat the Empire, and maybe restore the Republic / the Mandalorians / the Krath by doing so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - Decide &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you start, then go from there. I suggest trying to keep the classic trilogy movies true, and ditch everything else that isn&amp;#39;t common ground for your group. &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; keep Rogue One, because it is wonderfully bleak.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_alpz2p", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/StarWarsD6/comments/alpz2p/tips_for_world_buildingwrestling_with_lore_for/efg4g4s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsD6/comments/alpz2p/tips_for_world_buildingwrestling_with_lore_for/", "name": "t1_efg4g4s", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StarWarsD6", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1548948865.0, "created_utc": 1548948865.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsD6/comments/alpz2p/tips_for_world_buildingwrestling_with_lore_for/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wpra", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Discouraging all force sensitive characters?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "StarWarsD6", "link_author": "AlucardD20", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "efa5skk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "SenseiZarn", "num_comments": 11, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ef9ttp0", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_h1kl9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, the first DSP is free, basically.

What you're having, is a classic player problem where everyone should just sit down and talk to each other.\n\nWhat you're talking about, is the [DMPC](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5u76c7/the_real_dos_and_donts_of_running_a_dmpc/). And I've linked to perhaps the best post I've found that goes into some detail about that. I'll revisit that point shortly, but I'll go off on a few tangents first.\n\nThe way you're talking about levels and baddies and whatnot, tells me that the system will likely end up in something like Pacific Rim with its kaiju invasion, or perhaps The Avengers, when the Chitauri invaded. Or even Neon Genesis Evangelion (choose whichever version of Neon Genesis Evangelion that suits you).\n\nThe system or concept you're describing isn't that new either; building idealized forms of \"yourself\" has been an edge case of several roleplaying games. I'm actually not a fan of those games - though there's some common ground between me and my characters, I dislike building an actual representation of \"me\" in a game as an avatar, toon, or whatever. Partially because I find it clunky, and partially because it reveals too much about how I view myself. What can I say - I'm a private person. (Also, it has the potential to lead to heavy Mary Sueing, but I'll detail that more in a moment.)\n\nI wouldn't focus on the scale - there's plenty of ways you could build characters with power sets that would still be able to inflict damage on the kaiju opponents, so the scale of things isn't really the issue at hand.\n\nConsider a character that can form themselves into a superdense bullet and accelerate to hyperspeeds - essentially being a complete weapon system on their own. DMPC may be able to stand up to the kaiju in smash-mouth combat, but Bullet boi might come screaming in at Mach 15, impacting the kaiju with kinetic energy levels usually found with tactical nuclear devices.\n\nOr consider a character with the ability to form cutting planes of energy - being able to slice and dice a target into chunks (the size of the chunks depending on the size of the planes, of course). Or perhaps one can focus energy into a laser-like beam of incredible intensity. Or you could make a hologram battlemech with the character in the middle, fighting them [Player One *Gundam* style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pEPE9U17LE).\n\nOr maybe you have temporal powers, being able to inflict a million years' worth of time on the kaiju, completely changing any radiological processes (such as nuclear power reactors, not only fission or fusion, but also antimatter), making metal wither and corrode, and so on. Or consider a character whose power is to disassemble a structure on a nanoscale level, essentially 'derezzing' the target. [Clip from GI Joe showing what I mean.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ps3fGNzpd0)\n\nSo, the power set isn't the problem. The scale isn't the problem. The setting in and of itself, isn't the problem. It's the DMPC that is the problem.\n\nAll DMs / Keepers / GMs / Whatever their name is in the system one is running, will have NPCs. That is a given. Some are more powerful than the player characters; others are not. The GM will be running everything from the lowliest goblin to the avatar of the Sun God. Or even the Sun God itself / himself / herself, if that is the type of game that is played. This is a given, and is usually not a problem. Of course, occasionally there might be friction with an NPC where the GM likes the NPC much more than the players do, and may go to increasingly ridiculous lengths to keep the NPC around. This may develop to full-blown [Mary Sueing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue), and is a detriment to the fun factor for most of the people around the table.\n\nA roleplaying game is a group activity. There's usually a handful of people around the table, virtual or not, trying to do something collaboratively in order to have fun. The GM is usually the primary storyteller around the table, so already has a lot of the spotlight while trying to make the storyworld as vivid as possible. The primary agents into the storyworld for the players around the table are their characters, and the remaining spotlight is usually divided among these characters.\n\nSo the problem with the DMPC becomes apparent; the GM is already getting the lion's share of the spotlight - and may *then* inadvertently (or otherwise) build a character which habitually hogs whatever is left of the spotlight, to the detriment of the other players and their characters around the table. Which, by virtue of analogy, needs some spotlight too to avoid wilting and losing interest in the game.\n\nIf your \"DM\" can't see the problem inherent in a DMPC, your DM isn't a particularly good one. If your DM can't see the problem in building a character which *will* hog the spotlight by virtue of its power set and function in the greater narrative, then your DM is even worse. I can see that it would be fun to build a PC on equal footing with the other PCs, and perhaps to toy around with the occasional combat, just to test out the system - no problem. It is when the DMPC threatens to become a major part of the narrative, that the problem rears its head.\n\nEssentially, it can become a spectator sport for the other players, watching while the DM interacts with himself. That's at best awkward, in my opinion, and I have much *much* ruder analogies as to what that situation is that I could've used if you and I were face to face.\n\n---\n\nIf the DM wants to be an equal part of the player action, perhaps you're better off building a board game instead. There's several board games that have level up and gear rules - HeroClix, HeroQuest, Descent, Arkham Horror, and a plethora of others - and that format divorces the DM from a lot of their narrative duties to build the world, and allows the DM to participate at a player level on much more equal footing.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imma gonna point you over to &lt;a href=\"/r/rpgdesign\"&gt;/r/rpgdesign&lt;/a&gt; right now.
