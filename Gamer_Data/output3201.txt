I don't know what everything ring ratio does but maybe it being a multiplier of the 2000mhz ram is running at helps with stability?)\n\nI bought a 12700k back in december, also decided to go with tomahawk DDR4, I updated my bios once(had to do it through the button on the back. I couldnt enter the flash mode). But ran my old 3000C16 kit till yesterday (I think I bought the same kit (F4-4000C18D-16GVK)). Found this post when i saw the line 'command rate 2N' in the bios and decide to figure out what it was, googling if 4000MT/S gear 1 1N is realistic I found this thread.\n\nMy bios kept crashing trying to configure my ram, changing only the voltage would sometimes freeze up my bios, thought maybe it was training it or it just needed some time but it remained unresponsive for a pretty long while. First time i tried to change the command rate to 1N I put DRAM voltage to 1.4v the bios kept crashing trying to manoeuvre back to the setting after the reboot. In later attempts after turning xmp off and rebooting and using default XMP it would also crash when only changing the voltage when it wasnt even set to gear1. I ended up having to turn xmp off, reboot, then xmp on and put 1.5v and it didnt crash on reboot browsing the bios. I ran some aida64 memory benchmark and the stress tool with cpu on and with only memory ticked on after to check temps and it never got over 34\u00b0C. Then on the next reboot I changed it to command rate 1N and it booted up and I ran the windows memory diagnostic and it completed without faults.\n\nI also have no idea if I'm just really lucky with my IMC or if command rate 1 is even worth it because some video I watched comparing G1/2 command rate 1/2 gave pretty varied results for all 4 settings sometimes G2 2T being the best one in one of them.\n\nCurrently I'm running a 2070 and play mostly older games so its hard to get a cpu limited benchmark to test it out in. If anyone knows if a game I can test that might make me CPU bound I would love to try it out.\n\nAlso if you have any questions about my OC because it sounds like we're running a very comparable setup feel free to ask.", "edited": 1648584363.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: 12700k tomahawk ddr4, maybe same ram kit running on 4000 18-22-22-42 gear 1 command rate 1N worked for me at auto SA voltage of 1.446v and DRAM voltage of 1.5v (also possible useful info is that my cpu is overclocked with a custom turbo ratio and undervolted because I thermal throttle but the ring ratio is set to 40. I don&amp;#39;t know what everything ring ratio does but maybe it being a multiplier of the 2000mhz ram is running at helps with stability?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought a 12700k back in december, also decided to go with tomahawk DDR4, I updated my bios once(had to do it through the button on the back. I couldnt enter the flash mode). But ran my old 3000C16 kit till yesterday (I think I bought the same kit (F4-4000C18D-16GVK)). Found this post when i saw the line &amp;#39;command rate 2N&amp;#39; in the bios and decide to figure out what it was, googling if 4000MT/S gear 1 1N is realistic I found this thread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My bios kept crashing trying to configure my ram, changing only the voltage would sometimes freeze up my bios, thought maybe it was training it or it just needed some time but it remained unresponsive for a pretty long while. First time i tried to change the command rate to 1N I put DRAM voltage to 1.4v the bios kept crashing trying to manoeuvre back to the setting after the reboot. In later attempts after turning xmp off and rebooting and using default XMP it would also crash when only changing the voltage when it wasnt even set to gear1. I ended up having to turn xmp off, reboot, then xmp on and put 1.5v and it didnt crash on reboot browsing the bios. I ran some aida64 memory benchmark and the stress tool with cpu on and with only memory ticked on after to check temps and it never got over 34\u00b0C.
