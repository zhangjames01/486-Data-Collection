Facebook already forces its way into our lives with tracking, login IDs to access websites all over the internet, and by owning useful things like Facebook Marketplace and Groups that people need for their everyday life. TOMORROW they could, say, buy Zoom and make you create a Metaverse Shopper ID to talk to your work colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not even much of a logical leap to imagine dystopian shit like &amp;quot;Metaround&amp;quot;: Facebook literally buys all the transportation services in the area so you need to watch a 30-second clip of their sponsor, a neo-Nazi oil magnate, coo about the benefits of &amp;quot;fresh, clean, GREENPLASTIC, the plastic made with 4% less plastic!&amp;quot; in order to get into your Metacar, which scans your face while you&amp;#39;re in transit to make sure it&amp;#39;s you and that your eyeballs are focused on their in-seat advertising (minimum 3 ads viewed before doors unlock).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Democrats are fighting like hell to keep SOME types of responsible governance moving, but it feels like each year there&amp;#39;s more and more resistance.
