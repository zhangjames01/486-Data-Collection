Because it raises crime, lowers the economic flow, stagnating the economy.  \n\n3.  Do you?  Are you sure?  Because you're making the argument that everyone will just sit on their ass if we have a big enough net.  Yet basic human needs let us know that isn't true.\n\nFurthermore, this is about the old adage an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  No one is saying criminals shouldn't be tried, what we're saying is that offering this as an option means less people will commit crimes.  They won't act out of desperation knowing they have a means to get back on their feet.\n\nNo one wants to do that because corporate money in legislatures are ensuring that crimes are created so that prisons stay full, even if it's just some kid smoking weed.\n\n4.  Because the evidence of how safety nets work for the economy is settled science.  We've studied lots of places that have tried different levels of social programs.  It's not opinion.  It's not even really a question on how much we should spend on stuff.  We know that providing people an alternative to crime, is something they'll chose if they feel they have the option, regardless of severity of the punishment.  \n\nWould we save a lot of money if we didn't require ERs to treat dying people?  Short term?  Sure.  Long term?  Not really.  We'd lose people from the work force, have more people on disability for illnesses they can't treat, have hospitals discriminating on who they treat.\n\nWe'd save a lot more money if we got privatized insurance out of the system and just went single payer instead of profiting off peoples fears and illnesses.  Cut the profit margin out and watch prices fall.  Doesn't it strike you as odd that we're the most expensive of all industrial countries for health care?  Considering they're socialized?\n\nOn prisons, what you're talking about creates career criminals.  It dehumanizes a person into rebelling against the society that treated them so poorly.  Working with criminals to get them out of the situation that got them in prison in the first place has more long term benefits for the rest of us in making a productive member of society out of someone who'd given up on it.  That's what we want... right?\n\nBack to having never tried it... this thread has some good conversations you might be interested in:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ufdjm/has_there_ever_been_a_successful_libertarian/\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; No, it&amp;#39;s not.

No one is saying criminals shouldn&amp;#39;t be tried, what we&amp;#39;re saying is that offering this as an option means less people will commit crimes.  They won&amp;#39;t act out of desperation knowing they have a means to get back on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one wants to do that because corporate money in legislatures are ensuring that crimes are created so that prisons stay full, even if it&amp;#39;s just some kid smoking weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Because the evidence of how safety nets work for the economy is settled science.  We&amp;#39;ve studied lots of places that have tried different levels of social programs.  It&amp;#39;s not opinion.  It&amp;#39;s not even really a question on how much we should spend on stuff.  We know that providing people an alternative to crime, is something they&amp;#39;ll chose if they feel they have the option, regardless of severity of the punishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would we save a lot of money if we didn&amp;#39;t require ERs to treat dying people?  Short term?  Sure.  Long term?  Not really.  We&amp;#39;d lose people from the work force, have more people on disability for illnesses they can&amp;#39;t treat, have hospitals discriminating on who they treat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d save a lot more money if we got privatized insurance out of the system and just went single payer instead of profiting off peoples fears and illnesses.  Cut the profit margin out and watch prices fall.  Doesn&amp;#39;t it strike you as odd that we&amp;#39;re the most expensive of all industrial countries for health care?  Considering they&amp;#39;re socialized?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On prisons, what you&amp;#39;re talking about creates career criminals.  It dehumanizes a person into rebelling against the society that treated them so poorly.  Working with criminals to get them out of the situation that got them in prison in the first place has more long term benefits for the rest of us in making a productive member of society out of someone who&amp;#39;d given up on it.

Aside from just being a minimal safety net for people (in case I do ever end up there, etc) it keeps people from making desperate decisions.  It keeps people from turning to crime.

It keeps them out of the emergency rooms from poor nutrition and raising our insurance prices because the hospital isn't going to eat the cost, and the insurance companies aren't going to eat the cost... so guess who does?\n\nYour argument is bullshit, and you're 'feeling' an answer rather than using your head about what's actually happening.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what you&amp;#39;re saying is that you&amp;#39;re such a lazy ass, you&amp;#39;re living at or just above the poverty guidelines and have no intention to do more work because you&amp;#39;re making &amp;#39;enough&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines\"&gt;https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How are you on the internet if that&amp;#39;s the case?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, you&amp;#39;re not.

The rest of it is short term (3 months max every three years) for people not currently employeed, or people not being paid enough at their jobs to be above poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5)  Go back and read my first points.  Aside from just being a minimal safety net for people (in case I do ever end up there, etc) it keeps people from making desperate decisions.  It keeps people from turning to crime.  So in addition to helping create jobs from the goods they&amp;#39;ll purchase, it lowers the need for civil services like police and fire.  It keeps them out of the emergency rooms from poor nutrition and raising our insurance prices because the hospital isn&amp;#39;t going to eat the cost, and the insurance companies aren&amp;#39;t going to eat the cost... so guess who does?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your argument is bullshit, and you&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;feeling&amp;#39; an answer rather than using your head about what&amp;#39;s actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4wa45a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/4wa45a/during_obamas_lame_duckhe_should_propose_the/d684f4v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/4wa45a/during_obamas_lame_duckhe_should_propose_the/", "name": "t1_d684f4v", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1470599038.0, "created_utc": 1470599038.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.livememe.com/n55obwh"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "During Obama's lame duck...he should propose the following to fuck with the establishment", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "link_author": "iam4real", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d681rre", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "4-bit", "num_comments": 403, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d67tgx6", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5zbh8", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes.
