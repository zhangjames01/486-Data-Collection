Not to mention much of the original texts that influenced Gardner are easily available now (yes, yes I know certain secrets were only passed verbally, but I think personal experiences and revelations can more than make up for this with dedication) Calling myself Wiccan suits my needs because saying I practice witchcraft doesn&amp;#39;t seem to encompass the religious aspects strongly enough. Wicca seems to be something people easily grasp.
