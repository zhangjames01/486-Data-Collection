To even attempt to argue that the guitar itself exudes an innate image of anti-intellectual bravura is to discredit the instrument and insult every one of my beloved &lt;a href=\"/r/guitar\"&gt;r/guitar&lt;/a&gt; brothers and sister(s). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your comment has given me a headache so inflammatory that a malignant tumor the size of a golf  ball has grown between my hypophysis and frontal lobe. Your comment is so bad it gave me cancer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s the Ritalin, or maybe it&amp;#39;s because I&amp;#39;ve had a really shitty day - but I feel an almost primal compulsion to inform you of your latent stupidity with the upmost precision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is to my greatest displeasure to inform you, anonymous Reddit commenter - that if I finally got around to killing myself, I would jump off your ego down to your IQ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s safe to assume that your parents are dumb cunts,  since you are beyond a shadow of a doubt - a dumb cunt.
