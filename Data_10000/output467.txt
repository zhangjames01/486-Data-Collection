I think 20? scaled in such a way that it should account for both the tightest orbit we have currently observed in the known universe, as well as the furthest).  The way the orbital bands scale also map pretty well to the orbits of our planets, at least their semi-major axis.\n\nI then used Newton's equation (cause I'm... not clever enough to figure out Einsteins) to give me a formula that, given the mass of the primary, and the orbiting body, as well as the semi-major axis (as designated by an orbit band), would result in the orbital period of the body.  That was then trivial to turn into the orbiting speed, and since I don't care to much about being hyperspecific, I've been basically using distance travelled in orbit per day.  \n\n\nNow, entering the system from a stationary gate at the edge of the system, and travelling to an orbiting body, OR moving from an orbiting body to another orbiting body, I can simply use the date and determine the position of those two points and then use some simple trig to get me the distance between them.  The problem I have is with how that distance changes AS the travel time passes.  I know I can get that result, then add that many days to the destinations travel, and use that distance, and then redo the equation for travel time based on the new distance, and repeat infinitely, which is why I'm feeling like calculus is the way to go here.

I think 20? scaled in such a way that it should account for both the tightest orbit we have currently observed in the known universe, as well as the furthest).  The way the orbital bands scale also map pretty well to the orbits of our planets, at least their semi-major axis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then used Newton&amp;#39;s equation (cause I&amp;#39;m... not clever enough to figure out Einsteins) to give me a formula that, given the mass of the primary, and the orbiting body, as well as the semi-major axis (as designated by an orbit band), would result in the orbital period of the body.  That was then trivial to turn into the orbiting speed, and since I don&amp;#39;t care to much about being hyperspecific, I&amp;#39;ve been basically using distance travelled in orbit per day.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, entering the system from a stationary gate at the edge of the system, and travelling to an orbiting body, OR moving from an orbiting body to another orbiting body, I can simply use the date and determine the position of those two points and then use some simple trig to get me the distance between them.
