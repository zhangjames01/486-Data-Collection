The first thing they said no it's not thats you're friends i defend myself saying no it's not my friend's so they put me in the car then about 5 minutes later they take me back to my house (this all happened outside my house). they bring all scrap bits from the bike where they crashed, and my helmet. stupidly my friend threw my helmet of thinking they can't knock him off if he's without a helmet. After all this they say i'm to drunk they'll come get me tomorrow to question me etc because i'm to drunk, i say thats fine. I go back in my house phone my friend like bring the bike back, he's already on curfew breached it over 10x now and hes most likely going to jail he brings the bike back to my house and the police must of waited or something and soon as we were putting the bike in the garage they jumped out and grabbed us both and arrested my friend.\nTLDR:Friend uses my bike, gets chased by police.
