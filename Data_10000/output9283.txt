The relationship started out great, but at some point things started to change. Early on she talked about how she always had to have two boyfriends, but that it was different with me. Eventually it turned out that it wasn't, and that she would often cheat. She'd fly into a full on rage at the thought of me talking to another woman though, so I wasn't allowed to keep in contact with any of my old lady friends from band any longer. And then that turned into not talking to any of my male friends with wives or girlfriends, because that meant I might hang out with those guys and that those women might end up bein around. Then it got to a point where she didn't want me to even talk to my own sister because she was so paranoid that I might do what she was doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, I cut out so many people in my life in an attempt to keep her happy. And then she started drinking. And that became a whole new chore. And then she decided that we couldn't sleep in the same bed anymore because I would keep her awake with my presence. So I spent years sleeping on an uncomfortable couch. And that was when I was allowed to sleep. I was working a second shift job with 12 hour work days, and she wanted me to work extra each week, so that I was always putting in six days a week, and then she'd make sure to wake me up as soon as she got up and would be angry if I tried to so much as nap. Was sleeping maybe one or two hours a day, doing an hour commute to work, working 12 hours, then an hour drive home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorst bit is that even with all that, we were constantly broke and she kept having me ask my mom to help with bills so our services wouldn't get shut off. She was spending everything on booze, various drugs, and whatever else tickled her fancy. And I just went along with it all, because confronting her would lead to a fight, and she'd end up getting angry and would often get violent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually she just went full abusive. Both physically and mentally. And again, I would end up just taking it, because the alternative was her getting even more angry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was my full time job, just trying to keep her from being angry. I no longer had friends. I didn't have hobbies. I had nothing in my life besides working and then coming home and doing everything I could to appease her. Kept telling myself that this was love. Because it had to be, right? Why else would I go through all of this? I did all of this, sacrificed all of myself, because this was what love was supposed to be, and I would be rewarded with love in turn by doing this. She had to love me if I did this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was broken to a point to where when she shoved a handful of tylenol PM into my hands and told me that the only way she'd be happy was if I took them all, that I did. Because that was what love became to me at that point, that idea that I needed to do whatever she said and whatever it took to keep her, not even happy at this point, just to keep her from being angry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnded up with a stomach full of charcoal and a week in the hospital. She ended up spending that time telling everyone how I'd been abusive the entire time. That I had spent each and every day beating her, and forcing myself onto her. Then just before I got out of the hospital she took off to spend time with her new boyfriend on the other side of the country. Same guy she'd been talking to for over a year and that I had asked her about months prior, which lead to her getting angry and taking a knife to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot out of the hospital and ended up staying with my sister and family. Sister welcomed me back with open arms, and I cannot describe to you how great that first hug from her felt, and just feeling safe for once. That first night that I actually slept more than two hours, my god, the headaches and all blurred vision that I'd been struggling with just wiping away, I cannot describe the relief and just the satisfaction with getting that. My friends invited me out for a night out as soon as they could, and again, I can't even express what it felt like to laugh and smile for the first time in years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYears of my life spent like that. And to experience what it felt like to not have that weight on my back for a change. It was unbelievable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I was going through wasn't love. There was never going to be any sort of reward for what I was going through. All there was was me sacrificing more and more of myself to try and keep my ex from being angry, and even that was a losing battle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong winded personal story short, sometimes you need to cut your losses, OP. Sometimes you end up having to have that rough wake up call that what you're going through isn't what a relationship is supposed to be. You shouldn't be working fulltime at just keeping a person from being angry. A relationship is supposed to be about you also being happy, which, from what you describe, is not what's going on here. And I know that you said it used to be good. Trust me, I know exactly how that goes. But sometimes people change, or possibly sometimes they just start showing their true colors. I don't know. Either way, what you're describing just isn't what a relationship should be.
