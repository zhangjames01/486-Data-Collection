Since the beginning of this current civilization at the end of the last ice age, there has always been some group of dickheads or another telling the rest of the people what to do.

This worked great until most of the world already belonged to one empire or another. Hitler made the last push for global military domination in the name of National Socialism (that's what NAZI stands for btw) On the other hand you had the Fabian international socialists who established the UN in order to 'end all wars'. But they just made themselves the dickeads on top. \n\nDespite the war, the americans and germans were pretty close and the US snuck out a bunch of scientists and hundreds of former nazi corporations set up in the states. So now the internatioalists want to destroy America because she won't play by all of their rules. \n\nMost likely china and russia are going to nuke the shit out of the US in your lifetime.
