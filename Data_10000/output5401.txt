That means it's mostly good, but it has many bugs and just enough missing features to undermine itself :(.\n\nNote: the UI in the video above *cannot* be done in UIToolkit without hacks because Unity refuses to implement the full CSS/Flexbox spec - their 3rd party code doesn't implement z-order, and Unity refuse to add sort-order (without that you can't do the blue-diamond in the upper right corner that fills/empties - because it overlaps the graphic that comes later.

Most decent publishers have been begging (almost ten years now that I know of) Unity to let us respond to customers; Unity still refuses (it would require Unity to do some implementation work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... net effect: a lot of purchasers abuse the ratings system as a &amp;quot;file a support ticket&amp;quot; system, or a &amp;quot;ask for help&amp;quot; system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(3. Note that because Unity does ZERO POLICING of existing assets, there are many assets where the &amp;#39;support website&amp;#39; or email is a broken link / 404. Unity could write the script to detect ALL of these in less time than it took me to write this reddit post, but they chose not to. Instead they leave many assets on the store with broken / impossible support links. This pushes customers into &amp;#39;giving up&amp;#39; on using the existing support links. So while customer could/should click the &amp;quot;support email&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;support website&amp;quot; link, many of them don&amp;#39;t even attempt it. Again: publishers have been lobbying Unity staff for years to fix this, with no effect).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10apmw7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Unity3D/comments/10apmw7/unity_asset_store_removing_negative_reviews/j479hrt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/10apmw7/unity_asset_store_removing_negative_reviews/", "name": "t1_j479hrt", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Unity3D", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673631292.0, "created_utc": 1673631292.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/10apmw7/unity_asset_store_removing_negative_reviews/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What lyric can you post that will trigger the song in someone's head?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "Beautiful_Facade", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iu1ew63", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tmachineorg", "num_comments": 748, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_yevwgp", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_buyxa", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Meep, m-meep-meep, m-m-m-meep meep.\nMeep, m-meep-meep, m-m-m-[depressed trumpet].", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meep, m-meep-meep, m-m-m-meep meep.\nMeep, m-meep-meep, m-m-m-[depressed trumpet].&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_yevwgp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/yevwgp/what_lyric_can_you_post_that_will_trigger_the/iu1ew63/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yevwgp/what_lyric_can_you_post_that_will_trigger_the/", "name": "t1_iu1ew63", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1666904152.0, "created_utc": 1666904152.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yevwgp/what_lyric_can_you_post_that_will_trigger_the/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Screenshot Saturday #618 - Complex Geometry", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "gamedev", "link_author": "Sexual_Lettuce", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iri972c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tmachineorg", "num_comments": 21, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_xyj4g6", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_buyxa", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I built a pixelart town-generator for use in my roguelike game.

I created a simple 'language' for describing towns, from the bottom up, using drag/droppable settings. e.g. a town is made of streets, and streets are made of buildings. Buildings are made of floors, and floors are made ... lots of different ways.\n\n2. When it runs, each layer of the language picks a random subset of the layer below. So e.g. when making a Street, the street picks a random number of buildings, and for each building it picks a random \"building type\" (in the video above I have two building types: a blue-roof, and a brown-roof).\n\n3. Most of the work was in defining 'buildings' in a generic way, but also very simple and easy for me to edit. My current setup is:\n\na. A building is made of floors, each floor can be of different floor-types\n\nb. Floor-type \"random with edges\" has a sprite for left edge, a sprite for right edge, and a list of sprites that can be picked randomly to go in the middle.\n\nc. Floor-type \"multiple slices\" lets you put multiple partial floors together to make a single floor. So e.g. to make the upper floor in the video, it is made of 3 slices: a \"timber frames\" that is pure random (the \"X\" pieces separaing lower and upper floors), and a \"random with edges\" that has left side, then wall-color middle, then right side, and finally a 2nd \"random with edges\" that has the same setup but shadowed wall-color.\n\nd. The roof is similar: it's a \"multiple slices\" that generates the end-beams as one slice, and then the tiles as another slice, and then the roof-ridge as a final slice.\n\ne. Another floor-type is \"layered floors\", I use this to combine the main floor with a layer above it which is just windows, or just doors.\n\nf. There's a floor-type for \"sprites with spaces between them\" I use for the windows, and a floor-type for \"only 1 sprite, at a random position\" I use for the doors.\n\n...it's a bit more complex than that, because I have the different Floors co-ordinate with each other -- each floor looks at the size of its sprites, and they collaborate to decide how many feet long the biulding can be and precisely fit all the different floors (eg if Floor-0 is made of sprites 32x32 pixels, and floor-1 is made of sprites 48x48 pixels, then they will decide together that the building has to be multiples of 96 pixels wide ... which guarantees both floors will generate exactly, without dangling bits or gaps).", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: since lots of other people seem interested in this, I&amp;#39;ll clean it up and put on asset store for a small price.
