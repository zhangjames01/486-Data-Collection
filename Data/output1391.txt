The CIA had several black ops sites study the possibility of psychic warfare which included the men who stare at goats, but also people lifting 100 lb weights with their ballsacks. They funded a telepathic dolphin project that ended up with them spending an undisclosed (but reportedly massive) amount of money to get a handler to feed a dolphin incredible amounts of LSD and give it handjobs. They did the MK ultra project which might have actually helped turn Whitey Bulger into (more of) a psychopath. They performed a related psychological torture experiment on college students that very likely gave us Ted Kaczynski. They funded modern art because they were convinced that abstract expressionism and Dada would make Russians hate Socialist realism... something... something fall of Communism.
