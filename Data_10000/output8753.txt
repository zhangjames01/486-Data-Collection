Good, because you&amp;#39;re most likely dead and I&amp;#39;m not done. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the indestructible nature of the dollars countless future wars will be fought for possession of these godlike items. Societies will rise, only to fall again. Centuries to millenia later a cluster of humanity is finally able to fling the cursed items into the void of space as far and fast as possible. Only then will we be able to prosper once again and truely build ourselves back up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the greed of humans is great and the corruption of these dollars is even greater. We will better ourselves with a single goal in mind, to chase after that which has consumed us completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Grammer, spelling, and minor tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_d02cnb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TheMonkeysPaw/comments/d02cnb/i_wish_that_200000_1_dollar_bills_will_appear_in/ez7s3ny/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMonkeysPaw/comments/d02cnb/i_wish_that_200000_1_dollar_bills_will_appear_in/", "name": "t1_ez7s3ny", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TheMonkeysPaw", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1567727677.0, "created_utc": 1567727677.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMonkeysPaw/comments/d02cnb/i_wish_that_200000_1_dollar_bills_will_appear_in/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0y", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "For those with normal office jobs, how did you use python to automate your job?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 14, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Python", "link_author": "xyzabc123410000", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "exilcp4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Kasita_Aco", "num_comments": 257, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ct0hru", "score": 14, "author_fullname": "t2_5iyny", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Actually did that today. \n\nHave to update all 'Tier1' strings  to 'Tier2' in 400-500 Word templates on our server.
