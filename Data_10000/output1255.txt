It feels like this type of score can easily be dismissed as an arbitrary or biased feel good metric\n\n- Why is the source of this data not clearly represented on this graph?

This data, if it\u2019s even reliable or honest, only seems valuable for politicians and researchers, which is not communicated here\n\n\nThese types of infographics on this sub seem very disingenuous and misleading, and tend to simply provoke conflict and national supremacy in the comments. \n\nCue people making off-hand quips about their cultural facets, vehemently dismissing growing issues within their own country because of its score on this baseless chart, or passive erasure of countries who are not viewed favorably in the west, like China or Russia.

Follow-up question: what is the determining factor for a country to be on this chart? Is it being one of the 30 most developed countries, or is it being a country that is considered and has one of the highest costs of living?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is a \u201ccost of living score\u201d and why are the factors not shown/elaborated? It feels like this type of score can easily be dismissed as an arbitrary or biased feel good metric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is the source of this data not clearly represented on this graph? According to OP in the comments the company is Numbeo, which is a &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbeo\"&gt;company known for misuse of data that is easily alterable&lt;/a&gt;, but even if it was the most objective source, not clearly stating it in the infographic is dishonest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What conclusions can/should be drawn from this data for an individual? Many commenters seem to be struggling to understand if higher numbers have a positive correlation to personal spending/saving power, which cannot be answered here. This data, if it\u2019s even reliable or honest, only seems valuable for politicians and researchers, which is not communicated here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These types of infographics on this sub seem very disingenuous and misleading, and tend to simply provoke conflict and national supremacy in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cue people making off-hand quips about their cultural facets, vehemently dismissing growing issues within their own country because of its score on this baseless chart, or passive erasure of countries who are not viewed favorably in the west, like China or Russia. Is mainland China not on here because it\u2019s not one of the 30 most developed countries, or is it because it\u2019s cost of living score is too low to be on the graph? Same with Russia. It doesn\u2019t matter what someone\u2019s position is: this type of inaccurate/misleading data should not be supported on this sub&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ijwo6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11ijwo6/cost_of_living_index_in_the_worlds_30_most/jb1nce2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/11ijwo6/cost_of_living_index_in_the_worlds_30_most/", "name": "t1_jb1nce2", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dataisbeautiful", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678043930.0, "created_utc": 1678043930.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/rsx7ltavrtla1.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_1hmiog", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Pls no jokes about snakes being solid", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "LadaLyumosCOSPLAY", "link_author": "LadaLyumos", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jax83aq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Skybombardier", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11i6pf5", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_94zxw", "over_18": true, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I promise to be quiet about it, not a peep! \ud83e\udd2b", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I promise to be quiet about it, not a peep! \ud83e\udd2b&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11i6pf5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/LadaLyumosCOSPLAY/comments/11i6pf5/pls_no_jokes_about_snakes_being_solid/jax83aq/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LadaLyumosCOSPLAY/comments/11i6pf5/pls_no_jokes_about_snakes_being_solid/", "name": "t1_jax83aq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LadaLyumosCOSPLAY", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677958978.0, "created_utc": 1677958978.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.imgur.com/t2DxMoJ.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk95", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[OC] 30 most and least prosperous countries in the world according to Legatum Prosperity Index 2023.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": -4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "dataisbeautiful", "link_author": "_crazyboyhere_", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jair0a2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Skybombardier", "num_comments": 1863, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jaiq5f7", "score": -4, "author_fullname": "t2_94zxw", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ukraine had been bombing the region since 2014, slaughtering 14,000 people before Russia even bothered to care.

There were also wind instruments like saxophone in #5 or trumpet in #3 there, and the most unique to me being an electric guitar in #4. I say most unique because of you\u2019d like to learn electric guitar, there\u2019s a different style of learning an instrument that\u2019s no less valid, but can be hard to find a wide selection of music like the other examples you provided\n\n2) whatever you choose, you are the musician, not your instrument. You can switch, put down, pick up instruments to your hearts content; instruments are tools for problem solving and forming a mental image of sounds, and your education should be feeling freeing\n\n3) any instrument is capable of playing solo or in a group. What you may have been hearing about is the difference between a melodic instrument that can only play one (rarely two) line of music, like a flute, or a chordal instrument that can provide its own accompaniment as well, like guitar or piano. The violin would be considered a melodic instrument, but so too is the voice and that can be trained and improved without a group just fine\n\n4) if you are hearing large symphonic sounds, then you can safely assume there is a sea of strings playing. Most of the time you can expect about 12-16 violins playing, 4-8 violas, 6-10 cellos, 1-4 basses. Most wind instruments can be expected usually having 1 or 2 players, but for massive works can get up to 4 on an instrument like trumpet\n\n5) finding a method book to go with your playing will be very beneficial, and finding a teacher, while expensive, is the most accessible route for finding a sense of enjoyment.
