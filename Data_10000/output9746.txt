This said, I'm gonna take a stab at answering your question. And before I begin I'll say I am an engineer, though primarily electrical, so I will have to gloss over some of the more complex stress formulas as I make my assumptions. I'll point to sources of more information as I find them. Also, while the point of this post is less to prove I can do math (I can't) and more to demonstrate the concepts, feel free to double check and critique my math. I almost certainly got something wrong.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow then, let's begin.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe first thing we should cover is the basic forces we're experiencing. As a highschool physics course can teach you, force = mass x acceleration. The force we want to simulate is equal to 1G, or 9.8m/s^2. To get this, we'll need to spin the station at a constant angular velocity, calculated backwards via A = -w^2 x r, where r is the radius of our station, A is our centripetal acceleration (1G being the target), and w being the angular velocity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA smaller station will have far more obvious effects due to the fact that, if we want constant A with a smaller r, w will need to increase accordingly. Throwing a ball on a small station will be an interesting exercise, assuming it has a contained atmosphere.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis said, the force (1G) is identical no matter the size of the structure. Size only determines how much of the material needs to go into it, and how much time must be taken to spin it up to speed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet us further assume for now that we can spin any size of station up to speed (not a safe assumption, we'll come back to this later). All our theoretical station needs to do is stay in its tube shape while undergoing the stresses inherent in every point on the station being pulled away from the center at 9.8m/s^2. I will not go so far as to just assume \"oh yeah, steel can totally do it\" not because I'm up to the task of doing the math, but because I found a calculator to do it for me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Click here for disgusting math](https://www.amesweb.info/StructuralAnalysisBeams/Stresses-Rotating-Rings.aspx)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWorking with a radius we completely make up and calculating the necessary angular velocity via the formula above, we should have all we need to pick a material, do a little more simple math, and plug it into the above calculator. I'll run through an example.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe are going to build a ring 10km across, 500m wide, and 50m thick. We are going to build it entirely out of mild structural steel, but it won't be one large solid ring. 20% of the total internal volume of this ring will be taken up by the structure, and the rest will be empty space. Hard vacuum, or close enough that the extra mass will be negligible. We will calculate the necessary angular velocity from the outside radius, because it's close enough and 5000 is a nicer number than 4950. Solving for w gets us an angular velocity of 0.04rad/s (technically negative, but it doesn't matter here). 2pi radians makes a full circle, so this ring will be rotating once every 157 seconds, or 2.6 minutes. Our rpm, then, is 0.38.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext up on things we need but don't yet have, we need the numbers for density of our structure. We are simplifying it such that it is treated as one solid object (it's not but this is a reddit comment, not a dissertation) that has 20% the density of structural steel (because we are building it out of 20% steel, and 80% space). A quick google search gives us 7800kg/m^3. 20% of that is 1560kg/m^3. We will later be comparing it to some basic structural shapes to estimate our load. A solid brick of metal is not always the best design.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur handy calculator linked above has a link you can follow to find Poisson's Ratio for the material we are using. I will not pretend to know what this is. As steels are labelled in a way I'm not personally familiar with, I found it easier to find a datasheet on A36 steel (a typical structural steel used in construction) which lists the ratio as 0.26. This datasheet additionally gave me the elastic modulus (sometimes called Young's Modulus) of A36 steel as 200GPa.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore we look over what we learned from plugging all this into a magical internet calculator to do all the hard work for us, let's revisit some of my assumptions and pick out where errors might arise. I'm assuming an overall structural density of 20% is sufficient to maintain our ring's shape. I am assuming that, despite us not using a solid ring, Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio remain identical to that of the base material. In short, I am assuming that the structure we are building is functionally identical to a solid brick of steel, within reasonable margins of error. I am assuming that there exists a way to spin this whole structure up that does not cause extreme stress at certain points, leading to a catastrophic failure. And finally, I am assuming any atmosphere contained on our ring does not relevantly impact the structural properties of our ring.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, drumroll please. Our calculator has spit out that the total amount of tangential stress experienced by this ring is...about 60MPa. If you're an avid math avoider like myself, you might be asking what this number means. The answer is that this number needs to be compared to the tensile, or bending, strength of steel. A good safe quote at functional tensile strength in properly proportioned structural steel is around 250MPa, well above what we calculated. At least by the assumptions we've made, this ring should not fly apart in spectacular fashion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFrom here, we need to revisit that bit about spinning the station up to speed. Again, force = mass x acceleration. To accelerate such a huge mass at any reasonable rate, we will be putting some frankly absurd forces into our structure. Additionally, large objects can't be treated as some perfect single immutable structure. A long cylinder must be spun evenly, or shear (sliding, for lack of a better word) stresses will shear (I'm hilarious) the structure into individual, and likely no longer habitable, rings. This is not a physics problem, saying what is or isn't possible. This is an engineering problem, finding how it is possible. Answering that question requires a great deal of variables that I am not going to get into because at this point the post is 6500 characters long.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo wind down, the above math can be used to test any of a large number of designs for basic feasability. Precisely how it is implemented will determine if you have a functional space station with artificial gravity, or just a very expensive and rapidly expanding cloud of debris when all is said and done. The short answer to your question is there are few theoretical limits to the size of your space habitat (don't make it planet sized unless you want it to collapse under its own gravity), but economies of scale will certainly see you running into a wall when you're trying to spin up something that could encircle the planet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ntl;dr steel is magical and fixes all your problems. Cheers.\n\nEDIT: Apparently hitting the save button submits the comment instead of just, you know, saving it. So at least eight people have upvoted an incomplete engineering diatribe.
