Love this!\n\nEDIT 2: Also, downloads from PSN are now multi-threaded, if that's the right word. There's no queue, each game proceeds to download at its own pace. As soon as you initiate download the game appears in your games menu with a progress bar beneath it. A notification pops up when a partial download is ready for an install. I'm not sure how reliable this feature is. Partially downloaded Warframe claims it's ready to start installing but when I select it for install I get an install screen with a little \"thinking wheel\" but without a progress bar.

The disc installs are FAST in terms of being ready to play, the complete install takes what you might expect. I can start playing campaign Battlfield in a minute or so and the in-game main menu has a percentage display of how long till multiplayer's ready. In my experience the downloads of the game updates tend to lag behind the partial installs by a few minutes. You can start playing immediately even if the update is not finished but only non-network play. (So single player.) Minor quibble here, you get a progress bar for the update just like a game download but to see if the update is completed you'll need to go into a separate menu, \"notifications\".
