No room to set  up the machines, terrified of blowing something out if I even try.   The good news is that, statistically, most of the machines seem to either come up perfectly all right, even today, sometimes even after thirty years in a box; those that don't, there are lots of guys who know how to fix and can either do it for you or walk you through it.   The bad news is that it's apparently the power supplies that go bad, more often than not.  My workaround, for the moment, is that I got a modern, replacement power supply (tiny phone-charger-style wall plug, rather than the old-school big brick!  I couldn't believe it) for my 130XE, a few months ago, but haven't had time / worked up the nerve to try it yet.\n  \nAs for emulation:  I started using the emulator \"Atari800\", at v2.2.1, twenty years ago or so, and that has actually been adequate for my purposes right up to the present day and is my daily go-to unless I run into something it can't do, which basically *never happens*.  I hear v5.something may be out now, with v4.4.something (?) being the most current \"fully stable\" release.  I tried v4.4.whatever, recently, and it was *okay*; my biggest problem is that between my *very fast typing* and whatever has changed between the builds of my copy of v2.2.1 and v4.4.whatever, the newer one is noticeably *too slow in keyboard response* and *misses a lot of my keystrokes*.  That's a showstopper for me.  However, \"Atari800\" is a Github project, so source code is available, and I've been wanting for years to grab that, get the appropriate build tools, and build / tinker my own binaries from source.  With luck, maybe the slow keyboard response is a simple matter of suboptimal compiler options behind the binary I happened to get, and maybe I can produce one that works faster.  Either that, or I backtrack what's changed, and change it *back*, at least in *my* copy! ;-)   There's an old branch of the project that called itself \"Atari800Win\" and used Windows-style pulldown menus and dialogs for configuration; the mainline \"Atari800\" just puts up menus and screens in standard Atari style, which takes a little getting used to at first.  One cool thing that took me way too long to discover is that with the proper ROM image, Atari800 can be made to emulate the presence of a CSS Black Box, one of my all-time favorite Atari 8-bit peripherals.  One nice thing about \"Atari800\" is that, as a Github project, source code is available and can be built for a variety of host platforms; I've run it under Windows from 98 to 10 with no changes in behavior, on Linux, and there's even a build for Android devices such as my phone (where I think it goes by the name \"Colleen\" and may be a separate branch of the project, or something; I don't know much about Github or how to use it).  \n  \nI've also recently started looking at the latest-and-greatest \"star\" of the Atari 8-bit emulation, \"Altirra.\"  This is an extremely thorough, extremely detailed, extremely fine-grained, emulator of not only every model of Atari 8-bit machine that ever came out, but also every damned peripheral device, from Atari or any other vendor, that *connects to* the Atari.  I don't know if everything that appears in the menus and dialogs is actually implemented, or some of it is currently just placeholders, but -- Good God.  It's almost too complicated for me, which is why I am only just a noob with it myself.  It even comes with its own replacement OS, for those who fret over the (il)legalities of using images of the original Atari ROMs.   That replacement is what boots \"right out of the box,\" and you have to dig through the configuration system to make it use whatever .rom image files you might already have lying around from \"Atari800\" days, like me... ;-)  Still, some people swear by Altirra; I wonder if it's because the last decade's revs of \"Atari800\" *can't keep up with their typing...?*    \n    \nTwo exceptionally fun features of *both* the emulators mentioned, are \"virtual hard disks\" and \"turbo/warpspeed mode.\"  The former lets you map several directories (aka \"folders\") of the host filesystem to appear as disk devices to the emulated Atari; all you have to do in your programs is specify \"H1:filename\" etc. rather than \"D1:filename\" etc.  The latter causes the emulated Atari to \"run as fast as possible,\" without being constrained to merely 100% of physical hardware speed.  (I see about 800% (8x) speed on my Win 10 laptop, up to 2100% (21x) speed on my Win 10 desktop, and once saw something close to 4000% (40x) on an older laptop booted from a Linux LiveCD!  This is my favorite feature because I do a lot of floating-point-math-heavy graphics, and FP math is the slowest thing on the Atari.  (Oh.  Altirra has an option to switch in a \"high-speed FP math\" facility.  Don't know if that means different 6502 code in emulated ROM, or a callout to host-speed machine code.  But it works! ;-) ))  \n  \nAs to my \"development environment\" -- I hesitate to even call it that!  That sounds as though I should be using fancy tools, when really all I do is just what I always did with a physical Atari: boot BASIC (cartridge, on the 800, or built-in, on the XL/XE) with a MyDOS 4.53 floppy for disk access, and program away!  (For Action!, same thing, using the Action! cart instead of BASIC, of course.)  Altirra lets you copy-and-paste text directly into and out of the emulated Atari screen (E: device) if you want to use modern tools to write your code on the host platform and then just paste it into the Atari at the end, but I don't like doing it that way -- feels like cheating, LOL!  I do make heavy use of the virtual hard drive to store programs and files, both because it gives me room for large data sets that won't fit on a floppy (or in Atari RAM, at least not that I know how to access easily from BASIC) and because it puts everything in a single place so that I don't have to remember which floppy (or \"large\") Atari disk (image) I put them on.  The only drawback is that I occasionally want to use Atari800's ability to emulate the CSS \"Black Box,\" my all-time favorite Atari 8-bit peripheral device, and *that* can't be done with the virtual hard drive enabled, for technical reasons unknown to me.  \n  \nThe one thing I miss most, about the current state of Atari 8-bit emulation, is the lack of a fully-functional, multi-platform, dot-matrix printer emulator.  Altirra has a \"printer window\" where text will appear, but doesn't handle any of the escape sequences for compressed/expanded/italic/NLQ/etc. fonts or -- much more important to me, personally -- dot graphics.  (There are Epson and other dot-matrix-printer emulators out there, but either they don't do graphics, or they require Python, or only run on the Macintosh, or don't emulate printers as \"old\" as the 1980s models, etc., etc.  So I'm in the very beginning stages, right now, of trying to write my own.  I'm doing the prototype in Perl for ease of write-run turnaround and portability (I don't use IDEs, so that's not an issue either pro or con), but I'd probably have to port it into C or C++ if I wanted to share it with the larger Atari community.  That would  require me to become familiar with how to write cross-platform C/C++ code, build it on Windows, etc.  The Atari800 source code does that, so a likely path would be for me to first learn how to use Github, then learn how to build Atari800 itself from source.  *Then* I could tackle porting the printer emualtor.  That's a pretty long timeline, so to be perfectly honest it *might not ever happen* -- but it's a goal to shoot for, for what it's worth.)  \n\nBut I digress.  \n    \nFor documentation, depending on how \"pure Atari\" I'm feeling, I'll either write a Word doc and print it to PDF ;-), or stay in the emulated Atari environement and boot up either AtariWriter Plus or some form of TextPro.  That way I can blast along typing in an auto-wrapping editor, then format it \"for printing\" in whatever way I want, after-the-fact.  Generally that means a 38-column wide, no-page-breaks version to put on the Atari, and a 78-column-wide, 66-line-page version to print on paper or view on the host system (in e.g. Windows \"Notepad\").  \n  \nI hope this helps.

No room to set  up the machines, terrified of blowing something out if I even try.   The good news is that, statistically, most of the machines seem to either come up perfectly all right, even today, sometimes even after thirty years in a box; those that don&amp;#39;t, there are lots of guys who know how to fix and can either do it for you or walk you through it.   The bad news is that it&amp;#39;s apparently the power supplies that go bad, more often than not.  My workaround, for the moment, is that I got a modern, replacement power supply (tiny phone-charger-style wall plug, rather than the old-school big brick!  I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it) for my 130XE, a few months ago, but haven&amp;#39;t had time / worked up the nerve to try it yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for emulation:  I started using the emulator &amp;quot;Atari800&amp;quot;, at v2.2.1, twenty years ago or so, and that has actually been adequate for my purposes right up to the present day and is my daily go-to unless I run into something it can&amp;#39;t do, which basically &lt;em&gt;never happens&lt;/em&gt;.  I hear v5.something may be out now, with v4.4.something (?) being the most current &amp;quot;fully stable&amp;quot; release.  I tried v4.4.whatever, recently, and it was &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;; my biggest problem is that between my &lt;em&gt;very fast typing&lt;/em&gt; and whatever has changed between the builds of my copy of v2.2.1 and v4.4.whatever, the newer one is noticeably &lt;em&gt;too slow in keyboard response&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;misses a lot of my keystrokes&lt;/em&gt;.  That&amp;#39;s a showstopper for me.  However, &amp;quot;Atari800&amp;quot; is a Github project, so source code is available, and I&amp;#39;ve been wanting for years to grab that, get the appropriate build tools, and build / tinker my own binaries from source.  With luck, maybe the slow keyboard response is a simple matter of suboptimal compiler options behind the binary I happened to get, and maybe I can produce one that works faster.  Either that, or I backtrack what&amp;#39;s changed, and change it &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt;, at least in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; copy! ;-)   There&amp;#39;s an old branch of the project that called itself &amp;quot;Atari800Win&amp;quot; and used Windows-style pulldown menus and dialogs for configuration; the mainline &amp;quot;Atari800&amp;quot; just puts up menus and screens in standard Atari style, which takes a little getting used to at first.  One cool thing that took me way too long to discover is that with the proper ROM image, Atari800 can be made to emulate the presence of a CSS Black Box, one of my all-time favorite Atari 8-bit peripherals.  One nice thing about &amp;quot;Atari800&amp;quot; is that, as a Github project, source code is available and can be built for a variety of host platforms; I&amp;#39;ve run it under Windows from 98 to 10 with no changes in behavior, on Linux, and there&amp;#39;s even a build for Android devices such as my phone (where I think it goes by the name &amp;quot;Colleen&amp;quot; and may be a separate branch of the project, or something; I don&amp;#39;t know much about Github or how to use it).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also recently started looking at the latest-and-greatest &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; of the Atari 8-bit emulation, &amp;quot;Altirra.&amp;quot;  This is an extremely thorough, extremely detailed, extremely fine-grained, emulator of not only every model of Atari 8-bit machine that ever came out, but also every damned peripheral device, from Atari or any other vendor, that &lt;em&gt;connects to&lt;/em&gt; the Atari.  I don&amp;#39;t know if everything that appears in the menus and dialogs is actually implemented, or some of it is currently just placeholders, but -- Good God.  It&amp;#39;s almost too complicated for me, which is why I am only just a noob with it myself.  It even comes with its own replacement OS, for those who fret over the (il)legalities of using images of the original Atari ROMs.   That replacement is what boots &amp;quot;right out of the box,&amp;quot; and you have to dig through the configuration system to make it use whatever .rom image files you might already have lying around from &amp;quot;Atari800&amp;quot; days, like me... ;-)  Still, some people swear by Altirra; I wonder if it&amp;#39;s because the last decade&amp;#39;s revs of &amp;quot;Atari800&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;can&amp;#39;t keep up with their typing...?&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two exceptionally fun features of &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the emulators mentioned, are &amp;quot;virtual hard disks&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;turbo/warpspeed mode.&amp;quot;  The former lets you map several directories (aka &amp;quot;folders&amp;quot;) of the host filesystem to appear as disk devices to the emulated Atari; all you have to do in your programs is specify &amp;quot;H1:filename&amp;quot; etc. rather than &amp;quot;D1:filename&amp;quot; etc.  The latter causes the emulated Atari to &amp;quot;run as fast as possible,&amp;quot; without being constrained to merely 100% of physical hardware speed.  (I see about 800% (8x) speed on my Win 10 laptop, up to 2100% (21x) speed on my Win 10 desktop, and once saw something close to 4000% (40x) on an older laptop booted from a Linux LiveCD!  This is my favorite feature because I do a lot of floating-point-math-heavy graphics, and FP math is the slowest thing on the Atari.  (Oh.  Altirra has an option to switch in a &amp;quot;high-speed FP math&amp;quot; facility.  Don&amp;#39;t know if that means different 6502 code in emulated ROM, or a callout to host-speed machine code.  But it works! ;-) ))  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As to my &amp;quot;development environment&amp;quot; -- I hesitate to even call it that!  That sounds as though I should be using fancy tools, when really all I do is just what I always did with a physical Atari: boot BASIC (cartridge, on the 800, or built-in, on the XL/XE) with a MyDOS 4.53 floppy for disk access, and program away!  (For Action!, same thing, using the Action! cart instead of BASIC, of course.)  Altirra lets you copy-and-paste text directly into and out of the emulated Atari screen (E: device) if you want to use modern tools to write your code on the host platform and then just paste it into the Atari at the end, but I don&amp;#39;t like doing it that way -- feels like cheating, LOL!  I do make heavy use of the virtual hard drive to store programs and files, both because it gives me room for large data sets that won&amp;#39;t fit on a floppy (or in Atari RAM, at least not that I know how to access easily from BASIC) and because it puts everything in a single place so that I don&amp;#39;t have to remember which floppy (or &amp;quot;large&amp;quot;) Atari disk (image) I put them on.
