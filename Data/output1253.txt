Democrats claim to be a party that helps all citizens and claims that they care about things like affordable healthcare, affordable housing, climate change, livings wages etc., but their wallets are suspiciously closed and soundly crafted legislation is suspiciously absent when it comes to acting on these platform issues even when some of the issues are overwhelmingly popular with not only Democratic voters but all voters. This is because both Dems and Reps are very much aligned in putting corporate interests first, even if it is in direct opposition to what their voters want. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any solutions to the problems that increasingly unregulated capitalism presents don&amp;#39;t matter until you singularly focus the incentive of policymakers and elected officials back on the electorate. If that doesn&amp;#39;t happen, any law or policy instituted will be purposely flawed/circumventable or eventually be amended/repealed to placate corporate donors and corporate interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11g1ldr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Economics/comments/11g1ldr/ecb_confronts_a_cold_reality_companies_are/janlyij/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/11g1ldr/ecb_confronts_a_cold_reality_companies_are/", "name": "t1_janlyij", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Economics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677783134.0, "created_utc": 1677783134.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-confronts-cold-reality-companies-are-cashing-inflation-2023-03-02/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "ECB confronts a cold reality: companies are cashing in on inflation", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Economics", "link_author": "rudy_batts", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jangn2z", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "bigsbeclayton", "num_comments": 320, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jamhn7s", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_6mu4a", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't know of any think tanks in particular, but the wiki definition of neoliberalism is: Neoliberalism is contemporarily used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as \"eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, lowering trade barriers\" and reducing, especially through privatization and austerity, state influence in the economy.\n\nNeoliberalism effectively adopted a lot of the conservative economic policy positions that led to roaring capital markets while maintaining more classically liberal/progressive social policies.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know of any think tanks in particular, but the wiki definition of neoliberalism is: Neoliberalism is contemporarily used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as &amp;quot;eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, lowering trade barriers&amp;quot;
