In situations where there is a ball limit for a tournament this could in theory create an unfair advantage for a two hander.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, before the balance hole rule a two hander could use a layout where you have &lt;a href=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRaTUwr49jit6LpXuzBHEPnlAzHl9ee2gxQXO63y3o947SV3ac&amp;amp;s\"&gt;3 holes drilled in a triangle&lt;/a&gt;. That gave them 6 different ways to grip with 2 fingers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual usability of this is pretty debatable, in my opinion. But for something like a tournament with a ball limit, you&amp;#39;d probably have some anti-two hand bowlers that&amp;#39;d raise a stink over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_i2e32a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Bowling/comments/i2e32a/goodbye_weight_holes_new_usbc_rule_change_for/g04dl56/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bowling/comments/i2e32a/goodbye_weight_holes_new_usbc_rule_change_for/", "name": "t1_g04dl56", "author_flair_template_id": "a189b888-0357-11e7-bbe6-0e581776577a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Bowling", "author_flair_text": "'19-'20: 221/289/800", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1596388984.0, "created_utc": 1596388984.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 500, "id": "gid_2", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 100, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png", "days_of_premium": 7, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Gives 100 Reddit Coins and a week of r/lounge access and ad-free browsing.", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Gold", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png"}], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/ceeoyksg0me51.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r7ac", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Is mirror lake area open?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "SaltLakeCity", "link_author": "BlastingMolasses", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fyhnoey", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "YupYesYeah", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fyfc8aq", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3j58d", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "We were up there Sunday and Tuesday.\n\nSunday the entire mirror lake parking lot was overflowed and people were parking up the road leading back to the highway.\n\nTuesday morning the lot was half to three quarters full.
