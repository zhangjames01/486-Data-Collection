Right now Reddit and Google and various marketing and data-research companies are combing over these words, reading and interpreting them, deriving meaning the same way that we do, but I wouldn't call them conscious. To my original point: how much of our consciousness is simply stories we tell ourselves to explain decisions we made mechanically, as mechanically as a series of if/else conditions being iterated over by a very deep but still ultimately unwilling computer program. See the studies done on patients with split brain hemispheres, where the subjects would come up with stories (*and believe them*) to explain the actions of the other half of their brain (which was, in effect, isolated from the language center of the brain). It did this because it had have a story to explain its actions, even though it had no way of knowing why it was doing what it was doing (the instruction to right brain might have been \"pick up the red ball\", and the left (language) brain, when asked why they picked up the red ball, would answer something like \"red is my favorite color\"). I have to emphasize again that the left brain believed what it was saying to be true and it couldn't *not* have an explanation for what it was doing. So, again, my question is, what if our higher functions are doing this all the time? What if our \"consciousness\" is merely a story we're continuously telling ourselves, inventing motivations for actions which are as mechanical as clockwork, either as a coping mechanism or simply as a side-effect of having such a complex operating system sitting between our ears?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shouldn&amp;#39;t our definition of consciousness include some quantity of free will?
