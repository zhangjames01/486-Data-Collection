[Here's a press release though](http://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Cuts-in-federal-spending-likely-to-press-Pell-Grant--PR_232672) - it states that the Department of Education is facing budget cuts in the next fiscal year of $3.5 billion.  \n\nThe Department of Education's budget was about $71 billion in 2011, including about $29 billion dedicated towards the Pell Grants program.  Out of the whole budget, it appears that most money is dedicated to college assistance (see page 67 of [the Federal Budget](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/budget.pdf) for more information.)  $3.5 billion when compared to $71 billion is not a huge portion--it is nearly 5%--but that's still a very significant amount of money that will effect programs.  \n\n**&lt;speculation&gt;** If the Pell program helps 5.4 million students (as Wikipedia claims), making the average grant about $5360, and the 3.5 billion is taken out of all areas equally, that would be a loss of about $1.4 billion to the Pell program, or, again, about 5% of its budget.  For Rensselaer, a 5% loss in federal scholarship and grant aid would translate to a loss of about $0.46 million in Federal grant aid.  If we consider all of the Federal money that RPI receives, this loss would be closer to $2.8 million.  However, since not all the Federal money is from the Department of Education, it's hard to know how the other departments that give RPI federal grants and contracts (many presumably for research and other operations) will be impacted by this cut.  **&lt;/speculation&gt;**\n\nThis situation could negatively impact credit scores due to \"increased credit pressure due to the need to keep tuition prices as low as possible and increase their own spending on financial aid [and] downward enrollment pressure.\"  Although RPI's revenue is fairly diverse, we're not going to be immune to this.  Also, according to Moody's, a \u201c[l]ack of improvement of operating performance resulting in slowed growth of financial resources; continued spending of endowment well above industry norms; [or] additional debt without growth of financial \nresources and generation of revenue to support debt service\u201d could make our rating go down.
