Explain how your/mainstream feminism's version differs from mine, if you can. Do I have to spell it out? Your side calls those things \"widespread misogyny\", \"rape culture\", \"Patriarchy/Kyriarchy\" , \"historical oppression of women\".\n\nwidespread misogyny is the pervasive rejection of womens agency or worth besides completely superficial factors, unlike men who are valued for agency and deed. rape culture is a culture that makes it easy for criminals to get away with crime or lessens the blow, such as bemoaning a *convicted rapist* as having their life destroyed, or putting agency on the victim whether male or female. patriarchy is a society which is dominated economically and politically by men. historical oppression of women is the historical fact that the inferiority of gender minorities was enshrined in law.\n\nNONE of this remotely resembles your bullet points. you dont know the first goddamn thing about any of those things in quotes.\n\n&gt;That's just it! Men are already statistically significantly behind women in a lot of those! \n\nafaik the only statistics I know about where men are behind are higher education rates, rape reporting, and child custody. men still dominate politically and economically by insanely large margins.\n\n&gt;What you're really telling me here is that women's oppression will only end when every single socioeconomic variable is at least over 50% in favour of women. \n\nI literally said the opposite of this when I said they shouldn't differ by statistically significant amounts. a world in which congress is 51% male is completely goddamn fine.\n\n&gt;Purely a byproduct of their advocacy for women.\n\npurely rhetorical bunk. I could literally say any action by any adcocacy group that doesnt directly fit the bill described in the latin/greek root of their name is some kind of selfish endeavor and it remains an unprovable and meaningless claim. \"Bill and Melinda Gates are only fighting poverty and malaria as an ancillary goal to more publicity.\" stupid words. it's easy to say and functionally unprovable, so you slop it on the rhetorical table.\n\n&gt;Any benefit men get from feminism is a byproduct of feminism helping women. \n\nwith that perspective of feminism of course its some vast conspiracy to you, because its all about motive framing which is a worthless exercise.\n\n&gt;Sources for feminist organizations (or mainstream feminists) supporting father's rights movement, education availability for men, and equality in sentencing pls. \n\nhttp://everydayfeminism.com/2013/08/bias-against-fathers/\n\nexample of a mainstream feminist bringing to light the problems in custody law with citations and statistics. most liberal feminists support free and equal education as far as I know. to the last, that is not the inverse of your statement. you said feminists in general or \"mostly\" are against equal sentencing, prove it. I do not have to prove the inverse of your unproven claim, sorry.\n\n&gt;Nuh-huh. \"feminist theory starts with its assumption that women are subjugated in society and rejects value-free research in favor of an overt political agenda.\" (Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 35.)\n\nFeminist Theory is a specific branch of feminist thought, just like analytic feminism. seriously. itis not in general the theory of feminism. your gross ignorance on this matter is just one more example of why you are judging something you have willfully decided to misinterpret.\n\n&gt;They are *feminists*, don't weasel-word your way out of this. \n\nand elliot was a man, but I'm not charging you or any other man with prosecution for murder.\n\nyour statement was that most if not all feminists are in line with some fringe group of gender ethicists. that is patently goddamn false.\n\nif your next reply doesnt come with some sort of substantiative evidence that even a simple majority of feminists earnestly believe even *one* of your bullet points a couple posts up I will take it as an admission of falsehood and refuse to participate in any more weak goalpost shifting of yours or your cowardly red herrings.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not an answer.

Men are already statistically significantly behind women in a lot of those! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;afaik the only statistics I know about where men are behind are higher education rates, rape reporting, and child custody. men still dominate politically and economically by insanely large margins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What you&amp;#39;re really telling me here is that women&amp;#39;s oppression will only end when every single socioeconomic variable is at least over 50% in favour of women. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally said the opposite of this when I said they shouldn&amp;#39;t differ by statistically significant amounts. a world in which congress is 51% male is completely goddamn fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Purely a byproduct of their advocacy for women.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;purely rhetorical bunk. I could literally say any action by any adcocacy group that doesnt directly fit the bill described in the latin/greek root of their name is some kind of selfish endeavor and it remains an unprovable and meaningless claim. &amp;quot;Bill and Melinda Gates are only fighting poverty and malaria as an ancillary goal to more publicity.&amp;quot; stupid words. it&amp;#39;s easy to say and functionally unprovable, so you slop it on the rhetorical table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any benefit men get from feminism is a byproduct of feminism helping women. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;with that perspective of feminism of course its some vast conspiracy to you, because its all about motive framing which is a worthless exercise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sources for feminist organizations (or mainstream feminists) supporting father&amp;#39;s rights movement, education availability for men, and equality in sentencing pls. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://everydayfeminism.com/2013/08/bias-against-fathers/\"&gt;http://everydayfeminism.com/2013/08/bias-against-fathers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;example of a mainstream feminist bringing to light the problems in custody law with citations and statistics. most liberal feminists support free and equal education as far as I know. to the last, that is not the inverse of your statement. you said feminists in general or &amp;quot;mostly&amp;quot; are against equal sentencing, prove it. I do not have to prove the inverse of your unproven claim, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nuh-huh. &amp;quot;feminist theory starts with its assumption that women are subjugated in society and rejects value-free research in favor of an overt political agenda.&amp;quot; (Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 35.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feminist Theory is a specific branch of feminist thought, just like analytic feminism. seriously. itis not in general the theory of feminism. your gross ignorance on this matter is just one more example of why you are judging something you have willfully decided to misinterpret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;em&gt;feminists&lt;/em&gt;, don&amp;#39;t weasel-word your way out of this. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and elliot was a man, but I&amp;#39;m not charging you or any other man with prosecution for murder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;your statement was that most if not all feminists are in line with some fringe group of gender ethicists. that is patently goddamn false.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if your next reply doesnt come with some sort of substantiative evidence that even a simple majority of feminists earnestly believe even &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of your bullet points a couple posts up I will take it as an admission of falsehood and refuse to participate in any more weak goalpost shifting of yours or your cowardly red herrings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild":
