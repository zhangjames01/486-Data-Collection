Last one was a girl getting charged for sending her bf nudes. Almost the same story. She was being charged as an adult as the defendant and a child as the victim for crimes agains herself. wtf NC. \n\nTl;dr:  when I was a teenager I was arrested and had my phone searched. I had much worse photos and videos than the kid in this article had and could have easily been in the same boat as him. I just got lucky and never heard anything about it ever again. Heart goes out to this poor boy and the girl from another article similar to this one from a week or 2 ago. \n\nHere's a long story I'd like to share  ( if you have the time to read more than the tl;dr's at the top and bottom) where I was lucky to avoid a similar situation back when I was a minor. \n\nIt was about... 10 years ago? Down in the upstate of SC. So I was 15 at the time with a 14 year old gf. Happily engaged now btw! Me and my gf would make hella sex tapes on my phone. Mostly because I was a horny teenager and wanted somethin to abuse myself with when we were apart.\n\nAnyway,  I got arrested at a football game for giving a girl a cigarette that was bawling her eyes out and asked me for one. I didn't get arrested for the cigarettes of course, but for the pot they found in my pocket when they searched me because of said cigarette that they saw me give her.\n\n Fast forward a bit and they are going through my phone and really seemed to be enjoying themselves. Pictures of everything from pot, clocks set on 4:20, money, guns, and cars to dick pics and nudes from my gf. You know, typical HS student \"this is cool\" shit amongst the naughtier kids of the student body. Then they went through the videos, many of which were me and friends gettin high and other fun recreational activities. On top of that I also had a few sex tapes of me &amp; my gf. Yes, I know, I was not a wise teenager. Very stupid things to have on ones phone, especially as a minor. \n\nContinuing on, I find myself in an interrogation room at the local PD, being thoroughly interrogated and boy oh boy did these cops think I was the scum of the Earth or what. The captain himself speaking such gems as \" you need Jesus\" and \" whats wrong with this generation?\". They asked me about every single photo &amp; video I had. And I sure did have a lot of them. Maybe 200+ photos and about 20+ 15 second or less videos. ( that was about the limit on video length in those days). \n\nThey ask me about a picture of a Lamborghini I took. \" this your drug dealer?\" \n\n\"No. How often do you see a Lambo in Easley, SC? I'd never seen one up close before so I took a picture.\" (I found out later in life this was a rich young man that made a ton of money in the stock market\nthat owned the lambo. Along with an older Ferrari and an NSX. All impressive vehicles to see in my hometown.)\n\nThen they ask me about my brothers car, which I'll admit did look like a \" I'm a drug dealer!\" Vehicle. It was a caprice on 22\"s. So of course, \" this you're drug dealer?\" \n\n\"No, that's my step brothers car and he bought it with S.S. money he got in a lump sum because it took them so long to get his payments to him.\"\n\n\"What about all this money scattered around this AR-15 in this photo?\"\n\n\"Again, that's my brothers. The $4,500 cash, rifle, &amp; xbox360 in the photo were all cash/items he was given in a trade for his motorcycle with a friend of ours.\"\n\nThis went on for quite a while. Then they got to the sex pics and videos. Oh boy! Nothing embarrassing about a bunch of old men passing around and looking at your dick pics, nudes of your gf, and sex tapes of yourself and your gf doing it to Lil Jon songs. The one to \"Snap to fingaz\" was a personal favorite. \n\nOh, did I mention my parents where here for this part? What fun! Although I'm glad try were there to corroborate my defenses. Especially the S.S. My brother had and the very legal trade that was made for his motorcycle, etc. however we had little defense for the absurdity that would come after they got to those nudes and videos.\n\n\" how old is this girl?\"\n\nAt first I lie and I should have stuck with it. \"18\", I said. \n\nThey of course dont buy it and pretty much mind fuck me into admitting she was near my age. \n\nThen they go on to inform me and my family that I could be charged with child pornography and other various sex crimes.\n\nBeing the smart was I am, I had no choice but to respond, \"but.. I'm a child?\"\n\nThey go on to tell me how that doesn't matter and that they'd be investigating further and possibly turning it over to the FBI. \n\nSo I'll try and wrap this up now... I'm charged with minor in possession of marijuana ( .3 of a gram, smh) and paraphenelia ( a glass bowl/marijuana pipe for those that don't know). That's all. Didn't even get the fine for the cigarettes that I was initially worried about before they searched me. As for the \"child porn\", I never heard about that again, thank God. \n\n After a good amount of time had passed and I got out of juvenile detention ( I had broken probation with this latest offense and got sent off, but that's a whole other story) and served my punishments for that crime ( like visits to mental healthcare at $300 a pop &amp; community services) we went to retrieve my phone, but they had \" no record of it\". \n\nShudders to think where all that phone has gone and who has seen it's contents. I sometimes fear one of those pervert cops just fucking kept the damned thing. Sick fucks, but then I think maybe they sent it to the FBI afterall. Who knows, I sure as fuck don't know and I don't really like to think about it. It's disgusting to picture a bunch of old men getting their rocks off to child porn of me &amp; my fiancee. \n\nIn conclusion, I always thought it was ridiculous and figured there was no way they could charge me and hence that was why I was never charged with those sex crimes in the long run. But then, I read these latest 2 articles about these poor minors and think \"I am a lucky fuck to have dodged such a bullet. Same goes for my fiancee.\"\n\nLong story short, this shit fucking disgusts me on a very personal level and I am all too happy to have avoided the same fate of the kids like in this article, but damn if I don't feel very sorry for them and disgusted at the state I currently live in (NC) for bringing these charges against these kids. \n\nTl;dr:  when I was a teenager I was arrested and had my phone searched. I had much worse photos and videos than the kid in this article had and could have easily been in the same boat as him. I just got lucky and never heard anything about it ever again. Heart goes out to this poor boy and the girl from another article similar to this one from a week or 2 ago. \n\nAlso, sorry if this is long, poorly edited, or contains errors as I typed all this on mobile and it was a PAIN. I'll edit on the PC later today. \n\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second story I&amp;#39;ve read like this.

Down in the upstate of SC. So I was 15 at the time with a 14 year old gf. Happily engaged now btw! Me and my gf would make hella sex tapes on my phone. Mostly because I was a horny teenager and wanted somethin to abuse myself with when we were apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway,  I got arrested at a football game for giving a girl a cigarette that was bawling her eyes out and asked me for one. I didn&amp;#39;t get arrested for the cigarettes of course, but for the pot they found in my pocket when they searched me because of said cigarette that they saw me give her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a bit and they are going through my phone and really seemed to be enjoying themselves. Pictures of everything from pot, clocks set on 4:20, money, guns, and cars to dick pics and nudes from my gf. You know, typical HS student &amp;quot;this is cool&amp;quot; shit amongst the naughtier kids of the student body. Then they went through the videos, many of which were me and friends gettin high and other fun recreational activities. On top of that I also had a few sex tapes of me &amp;amp; my gf. Yes, I know, I was not a wise teenager. Very stupid things to have on ones phone, especially as a minor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continuing on, I find myself in an interrogation room at the local PD, being thoroughly interrogated and boy oh boy did these cops think I was the scum of the Earth or what. The captain himself speaking such gems as &amp;quot; you need Jesus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot; whats wrong with this generation?&amp;quot;. They asked me about every single photo &amp;amp; video I had. And I sure did have a lot of them. Maybe 200+ photos and about 20+ 15 second or less videos. ( that was about the limit on video length in those days). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ask me about a picture of a Lamborghini I took. &amp;quot; this your drug dealer?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. How often do you see a Lambo in Easley, SC? I&amp;#39;d never seen one up close before so I took a picture.&amp;quot; (I found out later in life this was a rich young man that made a ton of money in the stock market\nthat owned the lambo. Along with an older Ferrari and an NSX. All impressive vehicles to see in my hometown.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they ask me about my brothers car, which I&amp;#39;ll admit did look like a &amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m a drug dealer!&amp;quot; Vehicle. It was a caprice on 22&amp;quot;s. So of course, &amp;quot; this you&amp;#39;re drug dealer?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, that&amp;#39;s my step brothers car and he bought it with S.S. money he got in a lump sum because it took them so long to get his payments to him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What about all this money scattered around this AR-15 in this photo?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Again, that&amp;#39;s my brothers. The $4,500 cash, rifle, &amp;amp; xbox360 in the photo were all cash/items he was given in a trade for his motorcycle with a friend of ours.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This went on for quite a while. Then they got to the sex pics and videos. Oh boy! Nothing embarrassing about a bunch of old men passing around and looking at your dick pics, nudes of your gf, and sex tapes of yourself and your gf doing it to Lil Jon songs. The one to &amp;quot;Snap to fingaz&amp;quot; was a personal favorite. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, did I mention my parents where here for this part? What fun! Although I&amp;#39;m glad try were there to corroborate my defenses. Especially the S.S. My brother had and the very legal trade that was made for his motorcycle, etc. however we had little defense for the absurdity that would come after they got to those nudes and videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; how old is this girl?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first I lie and I should have stuck with it. &amp;quot;18&amp;quot;, I said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They of course dont buy it and pretty much mind fuck me into admitting she was near my age. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then they go on to inform me and my family that I could be charged with child pornography and other various sex crimes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being the smart was I am, I had no choice but to respond, &amp;quot;but.. I&amp;#39;m a child?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They go on to tell me how that doesn&amp;#39;t matter and that they&amp;#39;d be investigating further and possibly turning it over to the FBI. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll try and wrap this up now... I&amp;#39;m charged with minor in possession of marijuana ( .3 of a gram, smh) and paraphenelia ( a glass bowl/marijuana pipe for those that don&amp;#39;t know). That&amp;#39;s all. Didn&amp;#39;t even get the fine for the cigarettes that I was initially worried about before they searched me. As for the &amp;quot;child porn&amp;quot;, I never heard about that again, thank God. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a good amount of time had passed and I got out of juvenile detention ( I had broken probation with this latest offense and got sent off, but that&amp;#39;s a whole other story) and served my punishments for that crime ( like visits to mental healthcare at $300 a pop &amp;amp; community services) we went to retrieve my phone, but they had &amp;quot; no record of it&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shudders to think where all that phone has gone and who has seen it&amp;#39;s contents. I sometimes fear one of those pervert cops just fucking kept the damned thing. Sick fucks, but then I think maybe they sent it to the FBI afterall. Who knows, I sure as fuck don&amp;#39;t know and I don&amp;#39;t really like to think about it. It&amp;#39;s disgusting to picture a bunch of old men getting their rocks off to child porn of me &amp;amp; my fiancee. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I always thought it was ridiculous and figured there was no way they could charge me and hence that was why I was never charged with those sex crimes in the long run. But then, I read these latest 2 articles about these poor minors and think &amp;quot;I am a lucky fuck to have dodged such a bullet. Same goes for my fiancee.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, this shit fucking disgusts me on a very personal level and I am all too happy to have avoided the same fate of the kids like in this article, but damn if I don&amp;#39;t feel very sorry for them and disgusted at the state I currently live in (NC) for bringing these charges against these kids. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr:  when I was a teenager I was arrested and had my phone searched. I had much worse photos and videos than the kid in this article had and could have easily been in the same boat as him. I just got lucky and never heard anything about it ever again. Heart goes out to this poor boy and the girl from another article similar to this one from a week or 2 ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, sorry if this is long, poorly edited, or contains errors as I typed all this on mobile and it was a PAIN.
