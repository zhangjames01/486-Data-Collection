It just wasn't clear from the post, sorry.\n\nI read your comment below, and if you're dealing with video files, you don't need nearly as much read speed as you think. Unless you're doing a few *dozen* simultaneous streams off the drive, you're not going to hit the limits of any sensible pool configuration. Remember a single 4k stream is about 80-160 Mbps, or max of about 20 MB/s, while a single modern drive can usually do 150-200 MB/s of sequential reads. You'll likely be fine regardless of what you pick there, especially if you put a good L2ARC drive in (in addition to the RAM).\n\nThe ML dataset complicates things; it depends on exactly what sort of dataset it is. But since you'll be presumably loading it into vRAM at the start of a job and then running out of there, it's not likely to be significantly burdensome either unless you're running many at once, they're exceptionally large, or the time between jobs while waiting for it to load *different* data is significant short (if it's the same data over and over, the ARC will make it super quick).\n\nSo all that said, the question then becomes: how much do you care about capacity efficiency.\n\nThe \"fastest\" pool format is a stripe of mirrored vdevs, RAID-10 in traditional RAID speak. This gives you 50% usable capacity versus the total capacity of the drives with room for ~1.5 drive failures (statistically: you can lose 2, 3 or more drives but they must be in different mirrors; lose both in one mirror and the entire array is shot). \n\nWith this much CPU horsepower and RAM, you'll also likely get very good results with a RAID-Z2 (RAID6), which will give you 83.3% of your capacity as usable space, while being able to tolerate a full 2 failures before losing data. You do get fewer IOPS (random reads, and especially random writes) out of a RAID-ZX pool versus stripped mirrors, but for your usecase that doesn't seem to be your main concern; sequential reads and writes are still quite good. Another thing to think about is that expanding stripped mirrors is far easier than expanding a big RAID-ZX dataset, *for now*: online resize of a vdev has been in the works for a few years and last I heard was pretty close to being finalized.\n\nYou could also split your 12 drives up into two 6-drive vdevs doing RAID-Z2 in each and striping them together. This is a bit of a half-way between the other two options: you lose more capacity (only getting 66.7% of the total capacity), but gain a bit more safety and more expadability with ZFS as it exists right now (can grow by 6 more disks instead of 12).\n\nSo there really are a lot of options, and I know that's why you've asked, but the thing is, it's really hard to say definitively which one is best without doing specific workload tests and knowing the precise details of your current and future plans. That said, to recap your 3 main options are:\n\n1. 6 stripped mirror vdevs: 50% capacity, 1+ drive failure resiliency, highest possible throughput, very high expandability (+2 disks each)\n2. 2 stripped 6-disk RAID-ZX vdevs: 66.7%-83.3% capacity, 2+ drive failure resiliency, good sequential throughput, moderate random throughput, moderate expandability (+6 disks each)\n3. 1 12-disk RAID-Z2 vdev: 83.3% capacity, 2= drive failure resiliency, good sequential throughput, moderate-to-low random throughput, low expandability (+12 disks each)\n\nPersonally, I'd go with 3 for pure video because capacity there matters a lot more than random performance and the capacity factor makes it very attractive. It's very hard to expand in the future without doubling it or replacing all the drives, but you get more capacity out of the drives you have right now by a very large margin, it's simpler to set up and manage, and you'll still get good performance.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok that&amp;#39;s definitely a reasonable question. It just wasn&amp;#39;t clear from the post, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read your comment below, and if you&amp;#39;re dealing with video files, you don&amp;#39;t need nearly as much read speed as you think. Unless you&amp;#39;re doing a few &lt;em&gt;dozen&lt;/em&gt; simultaneous streams off the drive, you&amp;#39;re not going to hit the limits of any sensible pool configuration. Remember a single 4k stream is about 80-160 Mbps, or max of about 20 MB/s, while a single modern drive can usually do 150-200 MB/s of sequential reads. You&amp;#39;ll likely be fine regardless of what you pick there, especially if you put a good L2ARC drive in (in addition to the RAM).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ML dataset complicates things; it depends on exactly what sort of dataset it is. But since you&amp;#39;ll be presumably loading it into vRAM at the start of a job and then running out of there, it&amp;#39;s not likely to be significantly burdensome either unless you&amp;#39;re running many at once, they&amp;#39;re exceptionally large, or the time between jobs while waiting for it to load &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; data is significant short (if it&amp;#39;s the same data over and over, the ARC will make it super quick).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So all that said, the question then becomes: how much do you care about capacity efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;fastest&amp;quot; pool format is a stripe of mirrored vdevs, RAID-10 in traditional RAID speak. This gives you 50% usable capacity versus the total capacity of the drives with room for ~1.5 drive failures (statistically: you can lose 2, 3 or more drives but they must be in different mirrors; lose both in one mirror and the entire array is shot). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this much CPU horsepower and RAM, you&amp;#39;ll also likely get very good results with a RAID-Z2 (RAID6), which will give you 83.3% of your capacity as usable space, while being able to tolerate a full 2 failures before losing data. You do get fewer IOPS (random reads, and especially random writes) out of a RAID-ZX pool versus stripped mirrors, but for your usecase that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be your main concern; sequential reads and writes are still quite good. Another thing to think about is that expanding stripped mirrors is far easier than expanding a big RAID-ZX dataset, &lt;em&gt;for now&lt;/em&gt;: online resize of a vdev has been in the works for a few years and last I heard was pretty close to being finalized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could also split your 12 drives up into two 6-drive vdevs doing RAID-Z2 in each and striping them together. This is a bit of a half-way between the other two options: you lose more capacity (only getting 66.7% of the total capacity), but gain a bit more safety and more expadability with ZFS as it exists right now (can grow by 6 more disks instead of 12).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there really are a lot of options, and I know that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;ve asked, but the thing is, it&amp;#39;s really hard to say definitively which one is best without doing specific workload tests and knowing the precise details of your current and future plans. That said, to recap your 3 main options are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6 stripped mirror vdevs: 50% capacity, 1+ drive failure resiliency, highest possible throughput, very high expandability (+2 disks each)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 stripped 6-disk RAID-ZX vdevs: 66.7%-83.3% capacity, 2+ drive failure resiliency, good sequential throughput, moderate random throughput, moderate expandability (+6 disks each)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1 12-disk RAID-Z2 vdev: 83.3% capacity, 2= drive failure resiliency, good sequential throughput, moderate-to-low random throughput, low expandability (+12 disks each)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;d go with 3 for pure video because capacity there matters a lot more than random performance and the capacity factor makes it very attractive.
