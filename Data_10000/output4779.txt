If you tell someone that cutting corners on a home improvement project is going to lead to structural issues down the line, that&amp;#39;s pretty damn likely to just be a fact. If you tell someone that letting their dog sleep in the bed &amp;quot;just for tonight&amp;quot; is going to lead to them sleeping there every night, that&amp;#39;s just common sense. These are more direct cause/effect relationships though, and less of a &amp;quot;slippery slope&amp;quot;, though they&amp;#39;re still pretty similar at the end of the day. The slippery slope tends to come in when someone reacts emotionally, jumps to conclusions, makes sweeping generalizations, or simply applies an ignorant mindset to a situation to claim that doing A will cause some terrible, awful B to come about, when really they&amp;#39;re just being reactionary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11keds9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/11keds9/eli5_why_is_the_slippery_slope_fallacy_considered/jbak0cl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/11keds9/eli5_why_is_the_slippery_slope_fallacy_considered/", "name": "t1_jbak0cl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/explainlikeimfive", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678210673.0, "created_utc": 1678210673.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/11keds9/eli5_why_is_the_slippery_slope_fallacy_considered/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2to41", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "TIFU by cursing at a police officer", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 114, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "tifu", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbagpif", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "DomLite", "num_comments": 822, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jb9wht2", "score": 114, "author_fullname": "t2_903u7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd take it a step further and point out that the \"disrespect\" was directed at someone who racially profiled you, pulled you over for no reason whatsoever, actively looked for a reason to arrest you when there was none, and all but accused you of kidnapping or human trafficking, just for driving in the same vehicle as a white woman.

Player characters who aren't sorcerers or dragonmarked and thus have an innate and instinctive connection to magic, will have to have studied with an expert arcanist (or druid/cleric in the case of those specific classes) to have knowledge of how one might use more powerful forms of magic as their power grows, or seek one out to teach them a new spell.\n\nWith that in mind, some of these more powerful spells that you excise from the knowledge of the mortal masters might be hidden away on scrolls in ancient ruins, carved into the walls of a sacred shrine, stored in a spellshard entombed with a legendary figure who used one of these spells, or buried deep in a forbidden section of a grand library in the heart of Argonessen or in the fortress of Ashtakala, guarded by ancient Dragons or Rakshasa respectively. Perhaps you stumbled across an ancient remnant of Giant knowledge from thousands of years ago, able to wreak terrible destruction, and now you're the first mortal in thousands of years capable of casting Dark Star or Meteor Swarm. Maybe you're Aberrant marked and manage to unearth Halas Tarkanan's gauntlet, the Earth's Fist, only to discover that your mark is capable of activating it, and now you can unleash Earthquake to emulate the Earthshaker's terrible power. I'd make any spells of sufficiently powerful effect, be they beneficial or harmful, need to be tracked down in such a manner to make their acquisition and use feel like something truly epic in Eberron, as they should.\n\nOn the other hand, one might find some outdated scholarly texts that outline early mortal musings on magic and how to cast it, and find that the principles are so broad that they can produce a lesser effect, but perhaps are more widely applicable, so such a scroll about an early take on Mage Hand would be a little less effective, but also usable by Druids/Clerics/Paladins, while there might be a study notebook somewhere detailing a collection of extremely minor cantrips capable of creating the individual effects of Prestidigitation, Thaumaturgy, and/or Druidcraft that can be applied by all practitioners of magic, so if you want to learn how to make your voice boomingly loud as with Thaumaturgy but don't normally have access to it, you could learn it at the cost of one of your cantrips known slots if you deem it a useful addition to your character's repertoire. Similar adjustments could be made to higher level spells, as you've mentioned, perhaps with a longer cast time, shorter duration, or a less/more potent effect depending on which of the former you apply to it. The caveat would have to come in not only locating such old and outdated notes, but also having the knowledge to absorb the information, and the time to study it.
