Honestly, it&amp;#39;s not that bad - my commute is about an hour each way. It&amp;#39;s not great, but I like the job, am very well compensated, really like my colleagues, and have found a way to make use of the lost time in the car. For example, before covid I decided to go back to grad school (which my job paid for), and would listen to lectures in the car. Now, I use that time to decompress, listen to interesting podcasts, books on tape, find new music etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;#39;d prefer to not have the commute, but in the grand scheme of things it&amp;#39;s been worth it to me. I&amp;#39;m not looking to move because I love where I live, need the nature and outdoors that I have, so it works OK. The job has enabled me to buy a nice home, travel the world pretty extensively, earn a very good salary, have great benefits and retirement package...not saying it&amp;#39;s for everyone, but it&amp;#39;s been alright for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11eug4d", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/careerguidance/comments/11eug4d/anyone_commute_70_miles_to_work/jahyt2r/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11eug4d/anyone_commute_70_miles_to_work/", "name": "t1_jahyt2r", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/careerguidance", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677686340.0, "created_utc": 1677686340.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/11eug4d/anyone_commute_70_miles_to_work/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ukxe", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "If conservatives are wrong about everything, why are there so many of them?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskALiberal", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jadmbzs", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Armadillo19", "num_comments": 203, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11ed33l", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5fo6s", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I really don't see how half a country being \"wrong\" is surprising - throughout history countless political movements have garnered public support and objectively failed.
