Cooking is a lot of work, so she agreed to step back and not complain about how I went about it. It still bothers her, random pots, plates, and jars on the counter, but she doesn&amp;#39;t say anything. She&amp;#39;s happy that everything is cleaned up at the end, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that she doesn&amp;#39;t have to cook.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, vacuuming more often is very important to her, so she just does it all. Since it&amp;#39;s also a big job, I always will do the stairs for her, since I&amp;#39;m the only one who can carry the vacuum up and down and use it at the same time. The stairs don&amp;#39;t look dirty to me, but I do it for her. I don&amp;#39;t say anything.
