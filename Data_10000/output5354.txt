You'll run into technique problems that prevent you from executing the lines. I tried to stay hyper-hyper-aware of my body and I made sure to go out and watch how my local masters play.

There are bad habits that you should change, but every player has one or two that are so difficult to overcome that the better goal is to use that deficiency to your advantage.
