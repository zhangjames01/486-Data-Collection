If I feel grief and sorrow, sure, female friends typically are far more accommodating, but anything relating to the spectrum of anger (frustration, rage, aggression) I&amp;#39;ve found men far more accommodating. Anger is an important emotion, as much as any other, but when expressed in its full around females they tend to find it unsettling and become rather wary as a result, or they are in disbelief and don&amp;#39;t take it very seriously (like I&amp;#39;m exaggerating or toying with them).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What has your experience been with expressing anger around women vs men?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_z1zdg6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/MensLib/comments/z1zdg6/to_men_presenting_as_straight_how_do_you_feel/j330lbq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/z1zdg6/to_men_presenting_as_straight_how_do_you_feel/", "name": "t1_j330lbq", "author_flair_template_id": "d674e592-6c3a-11e9-a7fe-0afb553d4ea6", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MensLib", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1672943684.0, "created_utc": 1672943684.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/z1zdg6/to_men_presenting_as_straight_how_do_you_feel/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "People with mental disorders, what would you like people to understand better about your condition?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "demalejo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j2tb9d2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "theif519", "num_comments": 3354, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j2s8coa", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_54uoo", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "When it feels like there is nothing else to learn, I get so easily bored and find it near impossible to get back into it, but if the stars align I can get to the point where it is occupying every spare thought I have with no end in sight in terms of interesting things I can learn.
