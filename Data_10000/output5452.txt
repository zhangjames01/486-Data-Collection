My granny slept in the guest room with me, which was directly across the hall from her and my gramps' bedroom.  I got up In the middle of the night to use the restroom and when I walked to the doorway, I saw my gramps sitting in the chair in the corner of their room. I said something to him,  to which he didn't reply. That wasn't unusual, my gramps was the strong silent type.  I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom, he wasn't there when I got back. Being so young I really didn't understand what id seen and no hadn't given it much thought.  When I was a teenager my granny was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and within a year she had started deteriorating fast. One night she called my mom and uncle over to her house furious and upset. She told them to go out and get their grandpa (my gramps) she just knew he'd gone down to the liquor store. In his life my gramps was an alcoholic who struggled with sobriety.  My uncle and mom tried their best to calm her down and explain to her that Vernon has been gone for years so there is no way he's at the liquor store. She became irate and said something along the lines of \"dont tell me thay bullshit. He sat right here for am hour without saying one word to me and then got up and left\". After that day I told my mom about my encounter with my gramps, and we both believe that he was there to watch over her until her time came", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that my great grandfather stayed with my granny long after he passed away.
