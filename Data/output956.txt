Frankly, I like the idea of the game where you can choose from a bunch of different businesses and each one plays out a little differently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree with you, the genre is more defined by the tag - incremental (and often idle) influences and not so much by the IAP / ads / up front costs. Its muddy waters and I think the people in this subreddit are doing themselves a disservice by pre-emptively dismissing a game rather than understanding and defining what they like and dont like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you nailed it. Upvoting subgenre tags rather than downvoting IAPs is detrimental to the advancement of the genre.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ui1h0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/incremental_games/comments/11ui1h0/can_we_get_a_ban_on_business_empire_posts/jcqp2a9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/11ui1h0/can_we_get_a_ban_on_business_empire_posts/", "name": "t1_jcqp2a9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/incremental_games", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679171978.0, "created_utc": 1679171978.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/11ui1h0/can_we_get_a_ban_on_business_empire_posts/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh03", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How many of you microwaved the hamster in Maniac Mansion?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 6, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "gaming", "link_author": "RZAtheAbbot", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcqiwxl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "AnotherDrunkCanadian", "num_comments": 53, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11uwwo9", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_8jcpp", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "*raises hand*", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;raises hand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11uwwo9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/gaming/comments/11uwwo9/how_many_of_you_microwaved_the_hamster_in_maniac/jcqiwxl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11uwwo9/how_many_of_you_microwaved_the_hamster_in_maniac/", "name": "t1_jcqiwxl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gaming", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679169332.0, "created_utc": 1679169332.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/69xmr58i7loa1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2yia0", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Can we get a ban on Business Empire posts?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "incremental_games", "link_author": "Gramidconet", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcqh76l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "AnotherDrunkCanadian", "num_comments": 117, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcqfv88", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_8jcpp", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "One of us!
