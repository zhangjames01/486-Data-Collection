This does not constitute legal advice, but rather is a general statement and discussion of the law. Nothing here is intended to create an attorney-client relationship between us.\n\nIn Colorado, the vast majority of non-compete agreements, even those in actual employment contracts, are unenforceable. Only specific roles are considered enforceable. However, I don\u2019t think that is the issue here.\n\nIn Colorado, an employee also owes their employer a duty of loyalty. Basically, this means that an employee cannot take for themselves opportunities which would otherwise belong to their company. Doing so could result in a legal remedy available to the company in the form of an injunction, and possibly damages.\n\nSince this opportunity seems like it is outside the scope of your employers business, that may not be an issue. However, you did say this is a client of your current company. Keep in mind that, even if it is not legally grounds to sue you, the company could almost certainly still fire you over doing work for a client off book.\n\nAs for getting paid, I am a little unclear of the facts. Are you saying that you want to do this work on the side, and be paid directly by the customer, or are you saying your employer wants you to do this work, but is not willing to pay you? Those are two vastly different issues.\n\nAssuming it is that you want to do it on the side, does your company have a moonlighting policy? Also, if you have a good relationship with your employer, you might just ask them. Even if they want you to do the work through them, if you are the only one who knows how, you may have just found a whole lot of negotiating power with your employer.

Only specific roles are considered enforceable. However, I don\u2019t think that is the issue here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Colorado, an employee also owes their employer a duty of loyalty. Basically, this means that an employee cannot take for themselves opportunities which would otherwise belong to their company. Doing so could result in a legal remedy available to the company in the form of an injunction, and possibly damages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since this opportunity seems like it is outside the scope of your employers business, that may not be an issue. However, you did say this is a client of your current company.

Show that you can keep confidences, and you will get more responsibilities;\n\n2) related to 1, but slightly different - be a black hole for drama and gossip. Everyone will talk to you. Don\u2019t repeat what you hear, and stay out of the office drama. I have seen partners at a firm almost come to blows because they made mutual ultimatums regarding firing the other partner\u2019s admin over office drama. You know what the management committee did? Fire everyone. Just stay out of it. Everyone will trust you more as a result;\n\n3) volunteer to help when you are slow or bored. You could learn some cool stuff about interesting issues, but even if it is boring, the admins, paralegals, and lawyers will be grateful;\n\n4) if there is a senior partner, who has had the same secretary or paralegal for 10+ years, that secretary or paralegal is un-fucking-touchable. Handle with respect and care;\n\n5) phone etiquette. You cannot avoid it in the practice of law, especially as a receptionist. Young lawyers hate talking on the phone, so they will hide from client calls (I am a client now, so I know how it feels from the other side). As a result, you may wind up talking with clients more than some lawyers. Your phone demeanor will make your firm money, or lose them clients;\n\n6) expect that you be treated respectfully and professionally, both by people inside the firm and out. There are still lawyers out there who think the door-slamming, screaming, hyper-stress stereotypes of lawyers is some kind of necessity. It\u2019s not, and it is bullshit if it happens. Politely and respectfully standing up for yourself if you are being screamed at, or otherwise harassed is your right, and the same is true if it is coming from clients. I fired several clients because they were rude to my people. Life is too short, so let your leadership know if that crap is going on;\n\n7) notwithstanding the foregoing, be open to correction and criticism. Law firms are busy, time sensitive places. There is not always a lot of feedback on your work, and when it comes, it can seem very abrupt (again, not talking about abusive behavior, which is never okay). The best way I have seen this handled is for staff or junior associates to schedule time with the lawyer for more detailed feedback. Most lawyers live and die by their calendar, so if you can get 15 minutes, they can probably give you undivided attention. Seeking feedback while they are running around trying to file multiple pleadings is just a recipe for disaster.\n\nI hope this helps! Law firms can and should be great places to work, and with the right attitude and work ethic, a receptionist position can launch a great career.

Two have become firm administrators, three very successful paralegals, one went back to law school, and another is now a mid-level executive with one of their insurance clients.
