You do NOT start as the level 0/1 peasant that you do in some OSR games. Because of the system's Wild Die, player characters are, mechanically, just BETTER than most other enemies/npcs at EVERYTHING they do.

Sure, wounds penalize you, but the gameplay loop is to carefully use bennies to negate wounds / avoid damage / dish out damage to end combat in a way that avoids damage. At the same time, playing to your character's personality/flaws and doing outlandish things will but you in danger, but you're supposed to be rewarded for that. Even games that are more horror-horror than shooty-horror have a similar risk/reward balance, and the game's roots in squad based wargaming mean terrain/space management is really important even if you're playing a support/non-combat character. \n\nI think this is why The Eye of Kilquato is so popular as a one shot introduction to the setting.

Similar to what Matt brought up with OSR, but it's not about the entire dungeon delve and managing your resources as much as moment-to-moment placement within space.
