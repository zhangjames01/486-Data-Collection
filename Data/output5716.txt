for tourists, but I feel like I should still ask some questions and get some tips.  \n\nI visited Bologna-&gt;Firenze-&gt;Roma 2 years ago by airplane/train and I loved it, but this time I'm coming by car from Hamburg so I feel like that opens up more possibilities for also visiting e.g. smaller towns and more remote places. I'm currently living in a big city, and anyway with the Corona situation I wouldn't want to stay in big cities the majority of the time, though I'm not against it being a smaller part of my trip. My current plan is to book 1 or 2 places in the north of Italy and driving to a different city/town/village/castle/farm/forest/whatever every day. The region that's reachable for me (considering the driving time from Hamburg) is approximately everything east of Genova and north of Firenze, but that's not a super strict limit. It also depends on if I'm coming through Austria which is my current plan, or if I'll drive through France/Switzerland.\n\nI'm specifically looking for some tips on which places I should put on my list of things to visit, and it can really be anything. A farm for wine or olive oil tasting, a hot spring where I can relax for a few hours, a small village where I can feel like an Italian, a big city where you can climb up to some huge tower and eat a local specialty (I loved Bologna for this reason), an area with amazing nature like endless fields or mountains, some castle where you can explore the underground ruins, a sea-side town where you can rent a boat and eat some fresh fish after, ... I really like any type of travel experience.  \n\nI'm also looking for specific recommendations of where I should try to find a place to stay.

You'll understand why after reading the rest of this message.\n\nI strongly suggest that you find a decent hotel/Airbnb where you can afford to stay one or two months so you have time to find housing. I don't mean this as an exaggeration: it is impossible to find housing if you are not here already. And even when you are here it is difficult. Go to the Immo websites, set up search filters and react quickly when you are notified of a new ad. Prepare to spend a lot of time contacting landlords and agencies, and visiting houses. Ask the landlord/agent if the contract has a minimum duration, before this time it is a pain to terminate unless you find a new tenant, which is also a pain. Research the types of documents that tenants are typically asked for before they're even considered. If possible, get proof of the expected usage for gas/water/electricity so you know which costs to expect. Learn some basic German soon, for the housing visits, and just for general life. GET A LIABILITY INSURANCE. Look up 'Mietkautionskonto' to save yourself from potential future problems regarding deposits not being paid back.\n\nStaying somewhere temporarily also gives you the opportunity to explore and research the different areas in Hamburg. This is really important, because every area has a different feel, different kinds of people, different kinds of stores, different recreational options, different levels of English fluency ... Depending heavily on where you work and where you live, you should also consider if you want to travel by bike, public transport or car. I think your neighborhood is just as important as the actual apartment itself. By the way: living in the 'centre-centre' of Hamburg is reserved for the wealthy, or the non-picky, or both. It is also not necessarily the best option, depending on what you're looking for in general.  \n\nBe careful with scams, there are many offers on Immo websites that are too good to be true and suspicious: super fancy, super cheap, furnished, incorrect descriptions, only contactable through an external email-address, .... The story usually goes something like: \"I'm in another country because of work, an agent from Airbnb will give/mail you the key\". Variations of this are possible, just be careful, even if it seems like nothing can go wrong, e.g.: you're in the apartment, it looks like the pictures, you have the key in hand and it fits on the door, the agent leaves, you paid your deposit and rent, life is good. You might then after one week have the real owner walk in and be very surprised to walk into strangers in their apartment.  \nPeople might also contact you on their own initiative. Given that there are around 10-30 potential tenants at every housing visit, it is unlikely that a landlord has to go out of their way to find a tenant, so be wary.\n\nGermans like everything on paper, or at least provable with video evidence or witnesses. For renting a place, and for everything in general: get things on paper with signatures if you agree to something. NEVER just agree verbally to something with your landlord, ALWAYS get it in writing, no matter how friendly and trustworthy they seem. This is both to protect yourself legally, and to make sure that the landlord commits to his responsibilities. This one is probably obvious, but when you do get something in writing: READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING, don't let people take advantage of you because you don't speak German.

You&amp;#39;ll understand why after reading the rest of this message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I strongly suggest that you find a decent hotel/Airbnb where you can afford to stay one or two months so you have time to find housing. I don&amp;#39;t mean this as an exaggeration: it is impossible to find housing if you are not here already. And even when you are here it is difficult. Go to the Immo websites, set up search filters and react quickly when you are notified of a new ad. Prepare to spend a lot of time contacting landlords and agencies, and visiting houses. Ask the landlord/agent if the contract has a minimum duration, before this time it is a pain to terminate unless you find a new tenant, which is also a pain. Research the types of documents that tenants are typically asked for before they&amp;#39;re even considered. If possible, get proof of the expected usage for gas/water/electricity so you know which costs to expect. Learn some basic German soon, for the housing visits, and just for general life. GET A LIABILITY INSURANCE. Look up &amp;#39;Mietkautionskonto&amp;#39; to save yourself from potential future problems regarding deposits not being paid back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Staying somewhere temporarily also gives you the opportunity to explore and research the different areas in Hamburg. This is really important, because every area has a different feel, different kinds of people, different kinds of stores, different recreational options, different levels of English fluency ... Depending heavily on where you work and where you live, you should also consider if you want to travel by bike, public transport or car. I think your neighborhood is just as important as the actual apartment itself. By the way: living in the &amp;#39;centre-centre&amp;#39; of Hamburg is reserved for the wealthy, or the non-picky, or both. It is also not necessarily the best option, depending on what you&amp;#39;re looking for in general.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be careful with scams, there are many offers on Immo websites that are too good to be true and suspicious: super fancy, super cheap, furnished, incorrect descriptions, only contactable through an external email-address, .... The story usually goes something like: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m in another country because of work, an agent from Airbnb will give/mail you the key&amp;quot;. Variations of this are possible, just be careful, even if it seems like nothing can go wrong, e.g.: you&amp;#39;re in the apartment, it looks like the pictures, you have the key in hand and it fits on the door, the agent leaves, you paid your deposit and rent, life is good. You might then after one week have the real owner walk in and be very surprised to walk into strangers in their apartment.&lt;br/&gt;\nPeople might also contact you on their own initiative. Given that there are around 10-30 potential tenants at every housing visit, it is unlikely that a landlord has to go out of their way to find a tenant, so be wary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Germans like everything on paper, or at least provable with video evidence or witnesses. For renting a place, and for everything in general: get things on paper with signatures if you agree to something. NEVER just agree verbally to something with your landlord, ALWAYS get it in writing, no matter how friendly and trustworthy they seem. This is both to protect yourself legally, and to make sure that the landlord commits to his responsibilities. This one is probably obvious, but when you do get something in writing: READ AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SIGNING, don&amp;#39;t let people take advantage of you because you don&amp;#39;t speak German. Don&amp;#39;t let them pressure you into signing because they pretend to be annoyed that you don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s written.
