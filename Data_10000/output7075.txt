However, I feel like adding too much commentary to those bogs down the post and makes it difficult for the person who is trying to get information.  Not sure about you, but I know I&amp;#39;ve read though several dozen comments of a fight before trying to find the answer to a question I have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would it be more effective to allow for someone to answer the question in a comment as long as a link for evidence was included? I feel like the comments might still need to be more policed to make sure that they don&amp;#39;t end up with a bunch of people just sharing their personal opinions instead of having something to back it up (and making sure that they are just sharing the evidence vs saying how they interpret the evidence, as that&amp;#39;s not the point of the posts), but it might end up making it more succinct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11p6y9p", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/serialpodcast/comments/11p6y9p/weekly_discussionvent_thread/jc1sko6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/11p6y9p/weekly_discussionvent_thread/", "name": "t1_jc1sko6", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/serialpodcast", "author_flair_text": "God damn it, Jay", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678711497.0, "created_utc": 1678711497.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/11p6y9p/weekly_discussionvent_thread/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33vph", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Adnan Syed: Prosecution of children in adult court must end", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "serialpodcast", "link_author": "aresef", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbr3lpw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "alientic", "num_comments": 235, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11o2jc2", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_b5nkg", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "While I don't think that particularly has to do with anything in this case, I think it's nice that he's using some of the notoriety of Serial to talk about it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;#39;t think that particularly has to do with anything in this case, I think it&amp;#39;s nice that he&amp;#39;s using some of the notoriety of Serial to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11o2jc2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/serialpodcast/comments/11o2jc2/adnan_syed_prosecution_of_children_in_adult_court/jbr3lpw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/11o2jc2/adnan_syed_prosecution_of_children_in_adult_court/", "name": "t1_jbr3lpw", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/serialpodcast", "author_flair_text": "God damn it, Jay", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678498367.0, "created_utc": 1678498367.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/opinion/community-voices/commentary-maryland-must-halt-racist-ineffective-prosecution-of-children-in-adult-court-SV56WZ4JOBA2XKSUKQZRELZXVY/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_33vph", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Why lividity?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "serialpodcast", "link_author": "Justwonderinif", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jb9stuf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "alientic", "num_comments": 1, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11kw5b4", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_b5nkg", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Removing because it can't be reviewed -
