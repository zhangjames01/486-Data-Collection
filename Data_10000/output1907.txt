We play w/ a sweeper/stopper which sort of allows us to play similarly to a 3-5-2 because you can move the stopper higher up into the midfield when in possession and to slow down the counter.  I also encourage one of our two forwards to come back into the midfield to pick up possession and press the defense/mids from behind when the opposing team is in possession.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, it goes from a straight 4-4-2 when we&amp;#39;re in our own half defending, to a 3-1-4-1-1 when we&amp;#39;re in transition or when the opposing team has possession in their own half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Keep it simple.  A 3-5-2 is great when it works, but when it breaks down, it&amp;#39;s a mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_bj1n3g", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/soccer/comments/bj1n3g/tactics_tuesday_20190430/em5cpxk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/bj1n3g/tactics_tuesday_20190430/", "name": "t1_em5cpxk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/soccer", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1556641447.0, "created_utc": 1556641447.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/bj1n3g/tactics_tuesday_20190430/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj9g", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Looking for a tattoo idea (24M)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "tattoos", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "efh2yne", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "warwickharris", "num_comments": 2, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_alugit", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_b5s5t", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Find a good artist in your area and tell him or her this.

Two, broad, overarching duties are to do everything within the confines of the ethical rules and the law to help your client achieve whatever he has decided his goal is (in a criminal case, that's either a favorable plea deal or other type of resolution, or trial).\n\nThe other big duty is preserving client confidences and protecting confidential information.  Client confidences and confidential information is very broadly defined--in the state in which I practice, it's defined as any information gathered during the course of representation.  Now, there's an important distinction between a \"confidence\" and information that is privileged.  The two often overlap, but they're not the same thing (again, if you'd like I can elaborate on that but it's not important to understand that distinction for this issue).  It doesn't matter if the information is known by other parties or is part of public record--if you learned it during the course of representing your client, it is a client confidence, and you can only disclose that information in certain situations.  This obligation continues even after representation ends.\n\nSometimes, those two obligations come into direct conflict with each other.  And that typically happens when the same lawyer or another lawyer in his firm previously represented a witness/alleged victim in a different case.  In that situation, it is likely that the lawyer, in defending the current client would have to disclose confidential information about the prior client.  Therefore, the lawyer faces a conflict of interest--not within himself--but between his current and former client.\n\nHere's a concrete hypothetical.  Say I used to represent Jim in a case.  Now, during my conversations with Jim, I learned that he's a horrendous alcoholic, can't get out of bed in the morning without at least 3 shots of whiskey to steady his hand, is so drunk most of the time that he can't remember most of what happens day-to-day.  We deal with his case, and Jim and I go about our lives.  \n\nA few months later, it turns out Jim calls the police because he says his girlfriend, Jane, hit him.  I am appointed to represent Jane.\n\nNow, in defending Jane, I would be obligated to exploit that information that I learned about Jim.  I would have to investigate and try to demonstrate to the jury that Jim was so drunk at the time the alleged assault happened, he couldn't possibly have any reliable memory of the incident.\n\nProblem is, that information is a client confidence, because I only know that because of my representation of Jim.  So now, my obligations to Jane conflicts with my on-going obligation to Jim.  I can't represent Jane without violating my obligation to Jim.  If I were to respect my on-going duty to preserve Jim's confidences, then I wouldn't be doing everything I could to help Jane.  Therefore, I can't represent Jane.  I tell the judge that I have discovered a conflict of interest.  Jane will get a new lawyer who can go after Jim and his alcoholism and hopefully get Jane's case dismissed or get her acquitted at trial.  Jane wins, Jim wins.  I don't get disbarred.\n\nEdit: For me, this isn't necessarily passing up on a client.  Since I'm a PD, I'll get another case and then some to replace the one I withdrew from because of the conflict (I'll probably have two new cases on my desk by the time I get back to the office!).  For private attorneys, they may wish that they could get that fee, but it's not worth risking your license to practice.  Moreover, most criminal defense attorneys, public or private, want every criminal defendant to have zealous representation.  I don't think many would view it as \"passing up\" anything; rather, it's ensuring that the client gets the best defense possible.", "edited": 1456977251.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a problem--here goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re a lawyer and you represent a client, you have several important duties and obligations to that client.
