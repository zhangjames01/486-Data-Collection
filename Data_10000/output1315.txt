HOWEVER, she's being an asshole. I see two possible reasons that she's acting the way she is.\n\n1. She doesn't realize that she's being insensitive, going overboard with covering for you, and hurting your feelings (not likely) = Bad friend\n2. She's doing it on purpose to be hurtful to you. (Most likely) = Terrible ~~friend~~ person\n\nWhatever the reason is that she's doing it, you need to cut her out of your life. I don't enjoy being blunt, but sometimes it's necessary to emphasize an important message. She's an asshole. She's no longer your friend; she's just a terrible person that is toxic and hurtful to you. There's no reason for her to talk or act like that. She was purposefully putting extra effort towards demeaning you, and disrespecting the fact that you're trans. A real friend wouldn't say things that will draw attention to you, or say anything condescending about/to you. There's no reason to mention you at all in those situations. She was doing it on purpose.\n\nAlso, the touching she does when she knows you don't like it, especially if you tell her that at the time, is sexual assault (thighs, and any other personal areas, kissing, etc) If you tell her to stop, or say \"NO\" in any way with your words or actions and she continues to do it, that's sexual assault.
