LTE is the currently accepted 4G standard, and 3G requirements were met by multiple standards (EDGE, UMTS and CDMA2000).  Each standard takes multiple technologies and defined how they work together to provide a service.\n\nSince 3G standards have been out, there have been advances in multiple different areas of engineering.  This allowed these new technologies to be packaged together into a standard (LTE).  LTE meets the requirements set by the ITU for the 4th Generation (4G) of mobile technologies.\n\nProcedurally, it can be seen that the ITU *mandates* that 4G be faster than 3G.  3G was mandated to provide at least 200 kbps of data transfer (most 3G techs have surpassed this greatly).  4G was mandated to provide at least 1 Gbps of transfer rate.  Thus, by it's nature, 4G is defined to be faster than 3G.\n\nAlso note that LTE/WiMAX (2 \"4G\" technologies) don't meet the 4G standard on their own, but the ITU (under industry pressure) allowed technologies to be branded 4G so long as they have upgraded versions on the way (\"LTE Advanced\" for LTE and \"WiMAX version 2\" for the 2 above).

This is more complicated as many disks nowadays operate in blocks that are groups of \"bytes\", but the byte has stuck around.\n\nIn Networking/Telecommunication, bits are commonly used for 2 primary reasons:\n\n1. Bits are necessary in discussion (bytes are used sometimes to when referring to multiples of 8 bits) because framing/datagram/segment/cell information is encoded with multiple informative sections.  These sections have bit-codes which are not always in groups of 8 bits.  In fact, bytes are commonly referred to as \"octets\" instead of bytes to represent they hold 8 bits.  An example is in an IP header, where they use not only 8-bit codes, but also 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 6-bit and even a 13-bit code.  So from an engineering and logical point of view, we are working in units not able to be properly represented in bytes (this code is 1.625 bytes sounds stupid).\n\n2. Modulation of data is done in bit increments.  The electrical/optical \"symbol\" rate of a line actually indicates the rate of change in electrical/optical characteristics able to be carried on the physical cabling.  A symbol can represent a different number of bits based on the modulation used, from simple 1-bit modulation to 15-bits and possibly more.  Essentially very few modulation schemes actually transmit a full byte or a multiple of bytes in any symbol (256-QAM comes to mind as having 8 bits in every symbol), it is common to default to bits.\n\nYou'll notice something though that kind of pushes back against the \"Telecom companies fooling you\" idea.  The line-rate (colloquially known as bandwidth) is represented in bits, but data caps are represented in bytes.  If the telecom companies wanted to confuse you to their benefit, they would also rate the data cap in bits (not a 250 GB cap, but a 2000 Gb cap).  This of course ignores the background and common usage of Bytes for the data being stored.\n\nAlso, because bits don't operate at a computing level and don't operate at a layer of abstraction, a kb is almost always seen as 1000 bits, unlike kB which is commonly (if not completely accurate) seen as being 1024 bits.\n\nEDIT:  Another thing to remember is that the information that the sender is transmitting and the receiver is receiving is going to be encapsulated into many different protocols which all have headers that use up some of your prescribed bandwidth.  Thus if you have a 25 Mbps pipe, that is almost always the \"line-rate\", or the physical limit imposed on the line.  With the overhead accounted for, you will never truly achieve 25 Mbps.
