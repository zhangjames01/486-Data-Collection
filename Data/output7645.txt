Both you and your opponent could have different perspectives on what x is, and until you have both reached the same understanding of x, all conversation is moot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, forums will also teach you that over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1suy80", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/1suy80/lpt_for_college_students_how_to_get_money_for/ce1vpgu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1suy80/lpt_for_college_students_how_to_get_money_for/", "name": "t1_ce1vpgu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LifeProTips", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1387067118.0, "created_utc": 1387067118.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1suy80/lpt_for_college_students_how_to_get_money_for/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s5oq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "LPT for college students: How to get money for your used textbooks but still have a copy in case you need it.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "LifeProTips", "link_author": "AverageEverydayGuy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ce1vl62", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Siofsi", "num_comments": 160, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ce1ttwv", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3j7m9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "That's a fair point.
