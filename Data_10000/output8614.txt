Generally, there are pitchers and fielders.  Technically any player can play any position, but very rarely do position players (fielders) pitch or pitchers play other positions.

They can pitch the whole game if the manager allows them to.  If the manager decides that the pitcher is getting tired or the other team is scoring a lot of runs, he will bring in a \"reliever\" who pitches after the starter.  An top of that, teams will typically have a \"closer\" who is very good at getting the final few outs.
