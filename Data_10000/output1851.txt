Computing power / speed are certainly a factor in that consideration. I&amp;#39;m mostly concerned with reducing clutter in the formula itself so it&amp;#39;s easier to maintain/update&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example: Instead of manually inputting a column offset of 4, I could instead calculate how much of an offset is needed with a couple of formulas. Not too much trouble to come up with that solution, but since this is almost guaranteed to be a static offset I can skip the computing power to run those formulas and just throw in a &amp;quot;4&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11sj6yo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/googlesheets/comments/11sj6yo/using_arrayformula_to_automatically_scale_results/jchn7rn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/11sj6yo/using_arrayformula_to_automatically_scale_results/", "name": "t1_jchn7rn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/googlesheets", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679004304.0, "created_utc": 1679004304.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/11sj6yo/using_arrayformula_to_automatically_scale_results/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_12p4l2", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Banner Waiting List - Update 3.5 Part 2 | March 16, 2023 (see comments for more stats)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": -6, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact", "link_author": "tgdm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jchjyve", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tgdm", "num_comments": 24, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jchc7ti", "score": -6, "author_fullname": "t2_6f3by", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If Keqing sees a rerun, I can very easily remove her from the Exclusion list too!\n\nIf anything ends up rerunning or getting ghosted, I can always update the exclusion list easily and it'll automatically adjust the record holders on the other sheets too", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Keqing sees a rerun, I can very easily remove her from the Exclusion list too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anything ends up rerunning or getting ghosted, I can always update the exclusion list easily and it&amp;#39;ll automatically adjust the record holders on the other sheets too&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11sxsy7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/11sxsy7/banner_waiting_list_update_35_part_2_march_16/jchjyve/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/11sxsy7/banner_waiting_list_update_35_part_2_march_16/", "name": "t1_jchjyve", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Genshin_Impact", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679003014.0, "created_utc": 1679003014.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.imgur.com/piaxcSE.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_12p4l2", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Banner Waiting List - Update 3.5 Part 2 | March 16, 2023 (see comments for more stats)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Genshin_Impact", "link_author": "tgdm", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jch6je6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "tgdm", "num_comments": 24, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jch1zg2", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_6f3by", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I went all in on Dehya :V\n\nI do want to get Yelan to C1 at least for the big convenience (that thing is a NUKE, too), maybe C2.
