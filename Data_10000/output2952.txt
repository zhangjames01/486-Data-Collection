They don't just \"exist\" like Aurelion Sol stars. Notes are status effects granted to Seraphine and her allies through ability casts. Conditionally, her auto attacks can consume Notes from herself and nearby allies to empower that attack.\n\n(Part of) Seraphine's passive is that her abilities grant notes to herself and nearby allies. Not, \"the passive grants notes.\" The effects of the notes have to be described somewhere, so it's on the passive. Tons of champions, items, and runes modify or describe the behavior of other abilities.\n\nLux and Leona are the first two champs that come to mind: their passive is that their abilities apply an effect to enemies hit with abilities. It's not \"When Leona hits an enemy with an ability, this passive then applies an effect,\" but rather \"Leona's ability has this additional effect.\" The description and and death recap information just sit there because, well, it's a passive modifier to her abilities and the information/scaling needs to be somewhere.\n\nViktor, Syndra, Zac, Sona, Kha'Zix, ..., many champions have \"passives\" either on the champion passive or an ability passive that modifies the behavior of other abilities. Seraphine is far from unique in being a champion whose passive is really just additional/modified behavior of abilities.\n\nSyndra's passive is not \"When you hit a champion with Q and it is at rank 5, this passive then applies 25% more damage.\" The Q itself is permanently changed to have that effect.\n\n\"Affecting\" champions doesn't imply \"granting them bonuses,\" it just means that they're affected by the ability. There are plenty of effects that interact with allies that are not \"buffs\" (Kench W, Kench R, Ryze R).\n\nYou can call it strong, you can call it weak, you can call it balanced, but saying it's an oversight seems unlikely when it's been an interaction since release and is part of the most frequently tuned portion of her kit.\n\nKeeping Moonstone active is usually not an issue on champs that build it in most situations. Personally, I don't believe that out-of-combat Seraphine throwing Qs into the abyss to grant small heals to someone who is in combat, but within the 800 range of Seraphine's passive (which is shorter than her other abilities) is the \"broken\" interaction this thread thinks it is. \n\nWhat are the three situations in which this can likely happen? 1) you're disengaging and just trying to get buffs out for stats/survival with Moonstaff (as every enchanter does), or 2) you've disengaged and your ADC is behind you and being focused, or 3) you're just arriving to the fight and waste cooldowns throwing spells at your own team's back line. It's not like you're idling for several minutes a game in these conditions. Most of Seraphine's Moonstone healing is coming from \"active\" use, if you're not intentionally trying to not use her kit.\n\nA good double-w is going to be far more impactful for the game than any extraneous \"passive\" Moonstone healing.\n\nIt certainly seems completely intended. My only complaint is that is isn't consistent because Ivern bushing an ally doesn't proc Moonstone (and I am curious if Ryze R, Kench W, Bard E, and Kench R do proc Moonstone -- I'm almost certain Kench W does,  but I think all of these apply \"buffs\" just as Seraphine does).\n\nYou can make the argument that it is a questionable design decision and maybe not one you would choose, but it being a \"bug\" instead of the correct behavior given the wording of everything involved seems unlikely.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seraphine notes are not a passive.
