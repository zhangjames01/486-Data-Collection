Like a \"bring a trailer\" STI someone wants to get rid of that *wasn't* involved in a collision, for under $10K. \n\nMy 2010 STI had ~80K miles on it on presumably its first engine, and after ~3 track days the engine died. The previous owners' tune had probably seriously compromised the engine before I bought it (I was tracking it on a more conservative 19lb protune I put on it right after I picked it up). Since the IAG closed deck block went in I've been happy making lots of power; it would have been nice if I had that peace of mind from day one since the first time your engine blows up you second guess every last thing with the car. It really destroys the enjoyment of a car quite a bit if it's a daily. It's still got some various gremlins but it's a planned non-op track car now so I'm happy with it. \n\nSince it's a track car, a hatchback has limited aero options. That's one regret. I love having a hatchback as a daily driver, but you might want to consider a sedan for a track car if you are serious about it (serious: cage, etc). If you're getting a sedan, I would go for a GD or VA. I don't think they nailed the sedan design on the GVs, personally. \n\nI've had other mechanical issues on the 3rd gen. The firewalls have cracking issues, which lead to squeaky pedals. Some people make DIY drill-and-bolt kits to fix that, or you can get them re-welded. My ABS is acting funny (likely the aftermarket rotors I installed). On the old engine a camshaft position sensor failed (but that may have been related to the general health of the engine). I also had an old coil pack go out on track and thought the engine died *again* (see: second guessing your car after one major mechanical headache).\n\nPersonally I think the 2004 STI, especially being the first year it was available in the US, is the way to go.

The previous owners&amp;#39; tune had probably seriously compromised the engine before I bought it (I was tracking it on a more conservative 19lb protune I put on it right after I picked it up). Since the IAG closed deck block went in I&amp;#39;ve been happy making lots of power; it would have been nice if I had that peace of mind from day one since the first time your engine blows up you second guess every last thing with the car. It really destroys the enjoyment of a car quite a bit if it&amp;#39;s a daily. It&amp;#39;s still got some various gremlins but it&amp;#39;s a planned non-op track car now so I&amp;#39;m happy with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;#39;s a track car, a hatchback has limited aero options. That&amp;#39;s one regret. I love having a hatchback as a daily driver, but you might want to consider a sedan for a track car if you are serious about it (serious: cage, etc). If you&amp;#39;re getting a sedan, I would go for a GD or VA. I don&amp;#39;t think they nailed the sedan design on the GVs, personally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had other mechanical issues on the 3rd gen. The firewalls have cracking issues, which lead to squeaky pedals. Some people make DIY drill-and-bolt kits to fix that, or you can get them re-welded.
