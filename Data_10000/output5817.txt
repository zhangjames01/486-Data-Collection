I would love to envision hell as a kind of scholomance, or a university of the image of God inside all men: you have to go through the negative experiences you&amp;#39;ve given other people, but along the way there&amp;#39;s understanding of purpose. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suffering without understanding ends in madness and worse: true torment is suffering without knowing the cause and finding no lesson in it. Disoriginated torment doesn&amp;#39;t improve, refine, teach or lift the soul, it only destroys it in sadistic overkill.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if a murderer had to suffer the blows of his own knife in hell, having the understanding that he was the sole origin of that suffering and that he had become his own victim, wouldn&amp;#39;t that have a profound lesson to teach? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Material existence teaches those lessons too, but often it&amp;#39;s hard to establish understanding of the true origin of suffering because of limited perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_7z6463", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/occult/comments/7z6463/can_demons_turn_good/dur7e3c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/7z6463/can_demons_turn_good/", "name": "t1_dur7e3c", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/occult", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1519477224.0, "created_utc": 1519477224.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/7z6463/can_demons_turn_good/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Missing CDC employee left work sick 10 days ago, hasn't been seen since, police say", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "news", "link_author": "dumbgringo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dur4fjp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Sysiphuslove", "num_comments": 2578, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_7zo4r9", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_39dxw", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Let's hope he didn't end up crashed up against a pump at Hap's gas station somewhere in Texas.
