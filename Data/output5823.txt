Cards like the cycling lands give you inevitability, [[Flame Jab]] kills small threats, the self-mill feeds Anglers, you can also recur [[Desert]], [[Quicksand]] and [[Bojuka Bog]], while using [[Raven's Crime]] to strip the opponent's hand.\n\n[[Stoneforge Mystic]] would be flickered to find and play the Initiative equipment, becoming the best initiative creature as she can also find silver bullets for the match-up.\n\n[[Blazing Shoal]] would be a fine unban in Modern, but Pauper is already a red dominated format. I don't know it would be enough to make Gruul Infect work, but we're very close at the moment. Having cards like [[Fang Dragon]] to pitch would really help it's playability.\n\n[[Dread Return]] let's the various [[Ballustrade Spy]] and cycle Storm decks do even more things for free. It's not clear it would break the format in half, but [[Breath of Life]] sees play and this is almost strictly better. This would be a strong card.\n\n[[Tinker]] - I don't think you have played with Tinker enough to properly understand it's value as a tutor. Imagine a combo deck playing cards like [[Ashnod's Altar]] or similar. In the right deck, this is one mana more than [[Deadly Dispute]], but instead of a [[Divination]], you get [[Demonic Tutor]] and instead of getting a Treasure, you cast the card for free.\n\nEven just sacrificing an [[Ichor Wellspring]] to get a [[Boulderbranch Golem]] is better than Pauper reanimator usually manages, and that's one of the most mundane and fair uses of the card.\n\n[[Blood Moon]] would kill gates decks and force the entire metagame to rethink its position on bounce lands and fixing. It would be one of the best pieces of Tron Hate that would incidentally kill whole archetypes. This would be a metagame warping sideboard card.\n\n[[Surgical Extraction]] is fundamentally a free graveyard hate spell that any deck can play to deal with both niche combo's (e.g. Ballustrade Spy, [[Myr Retriever]] loops, etc) while also dealing with many cards decks struggle with.\n\nBurn vs. Gates? Extract the cat after they block with it. Playing against Dimir? Remove their [[Deep Analysis]], etc. Like several of the cards on this list, it wouldn't be strong enough to be banned (it's an answer card, after all), but it would completely retexture how certain match-ups are played.\n\nThe first card that comes to mind for me that is completely broken in other formats but would be fine here is [[Omniscience]]. Like Modern, we don't have ways to cheat it into play.\n\n[[Leonin Arbiter]] and [[Blood Sun]] are powerful cards in Legacy. We don't play 10+ fetchlands in each deck.
