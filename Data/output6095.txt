I had installed a new torrent client and had my pirate hat on at this point in my life. I started to download a movie and it was in a compressed format, multiple zip files I think. This client offered to let me preview/stream the contents of the files. I was able to watch the movie when it was only \\~10% downloaded by clicking a play button on the row for that torrent download.This blew my mind. I was ranting and raving to nearby room-mates about how this was a marvel in technology. It's still compressed! Files are missing! Checksums would fail there's no way to error correct or prioritize the packets it has no  knowledge of how things fit together until the download is complete! Torrents by nature are random portions of files! How can it DO this!? They just told me to let it finish and chill out of course. EDIT: Now that I recall, I THINK There was an extra layer of streaming from my computer torrenting to my xbox (original) running a custom dashboard that might have been what made it possible. It was sophisticated dashboard code, something opensource. And I think it was an ISO consisting of multiple zip files so yet ANOTHER layer of somehow mounting the iso to play it.\n\nMore recently, about a decade ago, some friends dusted off their battlenet client and decided they might try Wow again. It had been years for me so I don't know when Blizzard started doing it but it was new to me. I also dusted off my [battle.net](https://battle.net) client and started to download Wow. Again at about 15% it said I could start playing. WOW! I mean blizzard would have better knowledge of minimum files required to play/run but still that takes a-lot of foresight. It also seemed to be capable of re-prioritizing the pending downloads depending on what areas I intended to go into/load/play but I may be misremembering that.  Mind blown yet again at another technological marvel. Even if it's just foresight and smart coding that's still brilliant use of code IMO.\n\nThe \"Demo scene\" or maybe it's called the intro scene blew my mind.  This is a true artform harkening back to the \"cracked\" software intros from my commodore days of my childhood but it's still sort of a computer olympics that goes on today. Elaborate, Sophisticated, Intricate \"Demo\"'s that run 3d with lots of special effects and EDM/cool music or chiptunes......all in a 64k executable! Moleman: Demoscene: The Art of the Algorithms is a documentary series that kind of opened my eyes to these programming olympics and the culture even more if you care to check it out.\n\nLearning Subnetting and other network stuff kinda did that for me too. You see our elders who designed the TCP/IP protocols we all rely on doing nifty things with math and the more I learn, the more things just line up perfectly, efficiently, no wasted bits, so many things taken into consideration and so much forward thinking. No bloat just elegance and efficiency laying the foundation for what we have today.\n\nOn a more personal note one of the coolest things I've observed was a company I worked for had to upgrade the underlying OS on their servers from one linux disto to another as part of a product update. The team figured out how to do a full OS swap while it was running live. You could run htop and see all the processes running while this script was doing it's thing then suddenly everything drops, including init. and comes back again under the new OS.  I literally started clapping and laughing during the presentation. (Still required a reboot for the new kernel but it was badass and essentially functional as the new OS until the restart which you could plan and do later at your leisure)", "edited": 1637585529.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the first time I experienced this was a couple decades ago.

I was ranting and raving to nearby room-mates about how this was a marvel in technology. It&amp;#39;s still compressed! Files are missing! Checksums would fail there&amp;#39;s no way to error correct or prioritize the packets it has no  knowledge of how things fit together until the download is complete! Torrents by nature are random portions of files! How can it DO this!? They just told me to let it finish and chill out of course. EDIT: Now that I recall, I THINK There was an extra layer of streaming from my computer torrenting to my xbox (original) running a custom dashboard that might have been what made it possible. It was sophisticated dashboard code, something opensource. And I think it was an ISO consisting of multiple zip files so yet ANOTHER layer of somehow mounting the iso to play it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More recently, about a decade ago, some friends dusted off their battlenet client and decided they might try Wow again. It had been years for me so I don&amp;#39;t know when Blizzard started doing it but it was new to me. I also dusted off my &lt;a href=\"https://battle.net\"&gt;battle.net&lt;/a&gt; client and started to download Wow. Again at about 15% it said I could start playing. WOW! I mean blizzard would have better knowledge of minimum files required to play/run but still that takes a-lot of foresight. It also seemed to be capable of re-prioritizing the pending downloads depending on what areas I intended to go into/load/play but I may be misremembering that.  Mind blown yet again at another technological marvel. Even if it&amp;#39;s just foresight and smart coding that&amp;#39;s still brilliant use of code IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Demo scene&amp;quot; or maybe it&amp;#39;s called the intro scene blew my mind.  This is a true artform harkening back to the &amp;quot;cracked&amp;quot; software intros from my commodore days of my childhood but it&amp;#39;s still sort of a computer olympics that goes on today. Elaborate, Sophisticated, Intricate &amp;quot;Demo&amp;quot;&amp;#39;s that run 3d with lots of special effects and EDM/cool music or chiptunes......all in a 64k executable! Moleman: Demoscene: The Art of the Algorithms is a documentary series that kind of opened my eyes to these programming olympics and the culture even more if you care to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learning Subnetting and other network stuff kinda did that for me too. You see our elders who designed the TCP/IP protocols we all rely on doing nifty things with math and the more I learn, the more things just line up perfectly, efficiently, no wasted bits, so many things taken into consideration and so much forward thinking. No bloat just elegance and efficiency laying the foundation for what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a more personal note one of the coolest things I&amp;#39;ve observed was a company I worked for had to upgrade the underlying OS on their servers from one linux disto to another as part of a product update. The team figured out how to do a full OS swap while it was running live. You could run htop and see all the processes running while this script was doing it&amp;#39;s thing then suddenly everything drops, including init. and comes back again under the new OS.  I literally started clapping and laughing during the presentation. (Still required a reboot for the new kernel but it was badass and essentially functional as the new OS until the restart which you could plan and do later at your leisure)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_qz695a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qz695a/any_other_swes_amazed_by_software_and_technology/hlmrjjf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qz695a/any_other_swes_amazed_by_software_and_technology/", "name": "t1_hlmrjjf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cscareerquestions", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1637584699.0, "created_utc": 1637584699.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qz695a/any_other_swes_amazed_by_software_and_technology/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_4n2daa", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I'd rather have my feelings hurt than my game never sell....
