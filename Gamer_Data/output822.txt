I don&amp;#39;t understand why you felt the need to re-iterate the ideas that are basically the most repeated and standard arguments of the ruling class. It just perpetuates the fallacy that there are two equal and fair sides that deserve equal time in all discussion circles. That&amp;#39;s just not the case.
