Bugsy and The Fisher King are great movies, but didn&amp;#39;t have much pop culture lasting power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You likely know of Silence of the Lambs because it spawned many sequels and an extremely recent and pretty successful television show. Many other forms of media, like the ones above, have parodied it as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So SotL has the biggest cultural impact, but Cape Fear is a pretty big deal, being a Scorcese movie with De Niro as a villain and fellow nominee Nick Nolte (in a supporting role, but still the protagonist). The Prince of Tides is a little bit more obscure, but it had some good lasting power, considering The Sopranos referenced it close to a decade after it was released.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3nokwu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/todayilearned/comments/3nokwu/til_that_anthony_hopkins_won_the_academy_award/cvqb9my/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3nokwu/til_that_anthony_hopkins_won_the_academy_award/", "name": "t1_cvqb9my", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1444153518.0, "created_utc": 1444153518.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins#Hannibal_Lecter"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2waqy", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "help me with catching the sea guardian", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "persona4golden", "link_author": "Razhad", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cvp0zuq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "pmmcl", "num_comments": 5, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cvmk880", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6farc", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The guardian has longer breaks between its vibrations than any other fish, and its vibrations are the most severe.
