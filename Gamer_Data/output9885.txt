Color theory kind of eluded me; I thought about how discard effects are black and therefore it should be black, but board wipes are generally white, messing with the stack is generally blue... thought about Devoid? X{4} type deal? As part of the \"letting go your worldly tethers\" thing? Eventually landed on azorius cause of the card draw + max hand size bit + the token's color identity + the board wipe aspect, but wasn't definite on it.\n\nMeant to add a clause that made mana pools drain to prevent post wipe shenanigans, must've missed it in the many iterations I went through. Wanted to add a clause that said \"When this spell is cast, if it's mana cost wasn't paid, counter it\". Figured you might be able to get some kind of [[isochron sceptre]] shenanigans out of it. Thought about making X required to be at least 1, but I liked the idea of being able to just pitch hands if you wanted. I knew the end result of casting this card for it's full price meant restarting the game where you got potentially 12 cards in hand an no hand size, and I thought that kind of represented the idea of recieving boundless knowledge, so I was fine with that end result, since [[Karn, Liberated]] effectively does a similar thing at 7 mana (with *way* more hoop jumping).\n\nIs it perfect? No, absolutely not. But for what it is, I think it was a neat experiment into putting a real world concept into a state based card game.
