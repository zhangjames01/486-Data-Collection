The logic is that there's plenty of goblins making attacks, but a lot of them are likely going to miss. So you assume 10 missed in this case, but then the remaining 5 have a large bonus to attack. We could do a statistical study based on the party's average AC and the goblin's attack bonus to figure out how to best structure this, but you can also just adjust the number of attacks and the attack bonuses intuitively and see how it goes. If your party has high AC compared to the goblins' attack, 5 attacks having a large chance of hitting while 10 miss is likely fair. Unless I'm being dumb, if the average PC AC minus the average goblin AB is about 14, then 5 attacks out of 15 will hit on average. So if the AC-AB difference is around that, we can pull something out of our ass and say that each attack has a +10 bonus to hit, so that we're very likely to be getting the 5, or we can make a few extra attack and reduce the bonus to hit on each one to have more variance. This solution is a bit more probability-intensive, so unless you like doing math it's probably not ideal. It also gets more complicated with advantage, although I would personally not give advantage to the goblins in this position: they're hidden, but so are the adventurers. If they have to peek out to be able to see and attack the party, to me that would nullify their advantage. If anything they might be given advantage from the fact that they greatly outnumber the players and are attacking at the same time.\n\nAnother way to take it on is to make one roll for multiple attacks. My first idea for this was, for example, for 20 attacks, to have 5 attack rolls made, each representing 4 attacks. You could then roll some added variance, like subtracting 1d4 from the number of attacks that are mad off of the last roll, but this other idea is more interesting, I feel: you can partition it differently to try and guarantee more interesting variance: e.g. 1st roll = 2 attacks, 2nd roll = 3 attacks, 3rd roll = 3 attacks, 4th roll = 5 attacks, 5th roll = 7 attacks for a total of 20 attacks over 5 rolls. Regardless of how you split it, you can then also just do one damage roll for each successful attack roll, and multiply it by the number of attacks that hit (also optionally adding 1 extra roll for variance, e.g. subtracting 1d6 from the damage if the goblins are using 1d6 damage weapons).\n\nSo whether you take the first option or the second, in the examples given, you're going down from 50 attack (from advantage) + 25 damage = 75 rolls to 10 attack + 5 damage = 15 rolls. They're not perfect solutions, but they can both situationally simulate the real thing well enough.\n\nAll it takes is a little creativity and some abstraction, and you can have as big a battle as you want.\n\nAlso, I think this would be the absolute best solution, though it's dependant on programming skills: If you're not averse to using digital methods instead of relying on physical dice, it would be pretty simple to make a small tool for rolling large numbers of attacks, though this isn't a very useful tip unless you're a programmer, since I don't actually know of any tool like that :( I could write it up, but I wouldn't trust random binaries from an internet stranger, and neither should you", "edited": 1481388974.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "dm", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not going to comment on 1-8 since HighTechnocrat already did a perfect job, but I have a suggestion for 9: if you want to have, say, 15 attacks made against the party, while the other 10 goblins are repositioning/preparing/keeping an eye out/lost in the brush/whatever, you could do it like this: roll for only (e.g.) 5 attacks, but give each one a bonus to attack.
