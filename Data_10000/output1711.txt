It might depend on the panty liner brand. If you want to make sure that the panty liners you bought aren't uncomfortable/noticeable/won't fall off after being in the pool, the night before, you could up the panty liner on the inside of your bathing suit (like normal)  and either soak them in the sink or try taking a shower/bath with it on from the safety of your home and help of your mom/sibling/trusted friend, you can see if the panty liner shows or looks awkard or feels uncomfortable. \n\nIf the panty liner does work, you should be fine (just change them regularly with your tampon). The point is to catch any extra discharge or leakage. It shouldnt stain through the panty liner onto your suit since it thick of not to do that. \n\nWith tampons, personally I like to use those tampax pearl brand since, to me, they are easier to apply  because of the platic dispenser and comfier inside (I often forget they are in me!). Depending on how heavy your period is and what day you are on, you may want to try the \"super\" (as in observant) type for tampax pearl. My sisters are lifeguards and also teach swim lessons. They get *very* heavy period for the first few days. They use the super kind and change them every 3-4 hours in their *heavy* days. For me, although my period is not *as* heavy theirs, I can keep it ib for 4-6 hours on my heaviest day (first two days) and keep it in a good 6-10 hours (if needed, but I prefer to change them mine frequently for other sanitation reasons). If you have a lighter/regular flow amount period, you ahould definitely be fine with this.\n\n The regular size can work too, but you might need to change it more often depending on how heavy your flow is that day. I particulatly recommend getting the regular-super box ( sorry... I was trying to post a link to a picture of the box, but my phonr is being a pain...) The super might be a bit uncomfortable to put it in since the super are a bit ticker than the other tampax pearls, particularly if you are new to tampons. \n\nIf you put it in fully, to the point where you already discard the dispensor and ready to continue your day, and the tampon of whatever size feels uncomfortable what-so-ever when you stand up and move around/etc, most likely you put it in wrong (at the wrong angle/etc). It happens. I even sometimes do it wrong every so often. It is important to take it out and retry because it wont absorb properly if it is in wrong and will leak easily. If you are struggling with the super size, maybe just try the regular. Also know, it is normal to be uncomfortable with the idea of putting a tampon in and also not being that good at it. You are starting out. It is okay and a kot of girls (including myself) have a rough patch of trying to wear tampons at first. You just need to figure it out. I recommend practicing in the bathroom  on the tiolet with a mirror on the floor. You might even need to dig your finger in there a bit to figure out the right angle to put the tampon in. Once you get use to it, you can pop those suckers in mindlessly as if you are adding 2+2. Don't feel embarrassed and keep kearning from allowing you to wear tampons.\n\nTo also help, put a tampon in before you shower in the morning before the party so you can wash the extra left over blood outside and around your vaginal lips that would still leave a little discharge, definitely if you were a pad previously. You dont need to fully shower, just at least wash your genitial area before the party. You can also buy vaginal wipes to put in your purse, so when you go to change your tampon at the pool party or anywhere else, you csn quickly give your lower area a nice wipe to prevent that outer lip discharge.\n\nLastly, you could always wear some athletic fabric shorts if you are more worried about embarrasment of a stain showing than actual leakage/ little bit of discharge on the suit. I have tye dye white and blue bikini bottoms that got that discharge/leakage in it. Scrubbing it with hot water &amp; murphy oil soap (a wood floor soap cleaner) and then washing it in a washing machine like normal gets the stain perfectly out as if it is new !( as long as it doesnt sit stained for a week- which even so, gets it *nearly* out and fine from the outside) This can pretty much be bought at any local convience store.\n\nI hope everything works out and that you have a lot of fun at the party!\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think a tampon and panty liners  combo should work.

No matter what, he is a person who did this. It sounds like he stopped and changed... but who knows. If he did stop and changed for the better,.it  would mean he was a different person when you met him compared to who he was during the abuse period.

Hitler was a dog lover, an advocate for animal rights, and the nazi party passed a lot of animal protection policies while in power. If you didnt knew Hitler was the leader behind an awful genocide during WWII, you probably would have thought of him as a pretty good guy. But his rights does not make up for all the wrongs done. People are not so black and white like that. Humans are too complex to be labeled accurately. This is not me saying your friend is a certain way, it is me trying to help you process through what you think about him.\n\nMy assaulter is still the guy who supported me through some of my family abuse trauma. He will.forever be apart of that because he did. But he also was the guy who assaulted me in my sleep and I can never let that go. My mother is emotionally abusive to me and has been so while I was growing up, but she has done some very motherly things and also has made some positive impact in my life. She was emotionally abused as a child, while also I still love her and want to give her the supporting love she never recieve growing up.\n\nWith confronting your friend, I think you should. It would be best for both your friend and his sister. It might help his sister through her trauma. With your friend, you said he has been acting different recently, correct? It just happens to be around the time his sister starts remembering? Even if that is not the case, it might be that he was repressing the guilt he felt doing that to her and now it is finally leaking through again. It sounds like, no matter what, he needs help and it most likely has to do with his past behavior.Talking about it to a trusted friend (such as yourself) can help him through the emotional distress he is now facing. Avoiding it would only  be putting a rug over a hole, which eventually he will step on, fall through, and greatly hurt himself or others.\n\nOn advice for the sister, she definitely should be continueing.counseling. Tell her to reach out to other supportive friends in her life. It looks like she won't be getting much support from her family, definitely since it looks like her parents did not give her the right amount of support the first time. No matter what happened, she is still a strong beautiful woman who will get through this. I know she might be realizing that her family wasn't the way she thought they were (which is definitely difficult to proccess- I know from personal experience) but she will eventually work through a point in her grief that she hits acceptance of the past. In the mean time, she will be on an emotional rollercoaster. Make sure to tell her that the emotional rollercoaster she is experiencing is COMPLETELY OKAY and normal to experience. That she shouldn't hate herself for having a lot of emotional distress. It is okay to not be okay.\n\n I hope everything works out for you and all of those involved.  You are very kind and strong for caring so much for them.\n\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was sexually assaulted by a very close friend recently, so I understand your confusion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With what to think about your friend, it is hard to say.

In the mean time, she will be on an emotional rollercoaster. Make sure to tell her that the emotional rollercoaster she is experiencing is COMPLETELY OKAY and normal to experience. That she shouldn&amp;#39;t hate herself for having a lot of emotional distress. It is okay to not be okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope everything works out for you and all of those involved.
