The distinction between competitive play and casual play makes this messy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In competitive play, winning is the most important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In casual play, fun is most important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a spike, to have fun you must try to win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this loose logical argument, a spike is ALWAYS playing competitively, since at no point is a spike trying to have fun independent of trying to win. The rules committee isn&amp;#39;t as interested in satisfying competitive players trying to play a casual format. French commander or tiny leaders would probably be a better match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tldr: casual play isn&amp;#39;t meant for spikes, tournaments are.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_30e7cl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/magicTCG/comments/30e7cl/sheldon_menery_explains_the_new_commander_tuck/cps6qp6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/30e7cl/sheldon_menery_explains_the_new_commander_tuck/", "name": "t1_cps6qp6", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/magicTCG", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1427427460.0, "created_utc": 1427427460.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.starcitygames.com/article/30542_Tuck.html"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qn5f", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How expensive is Magic online?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "magicTCG", "link_author": "Varlify", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cpjv6fr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "idouglas", "num_comments": 42, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cpjuwut", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_783bj", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This.

The zombies come in tapped so they can't flash-block, 4 mana before getting anything out of it is a lot to commit, and a deck that needs stockpile on-2 needs a few copies. Additional copies does nothing and get stuck in your hand without a card like wild guess.
