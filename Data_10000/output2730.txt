(Didn't work. They heard everything.)\n\nApparently she was Jewish and he was Protestant and not once in their relationship had they discussed religion. They went at it on and off for two hours. She was screaming at the top of her lungs about how their (non-existent) children would be raised Jewish, and how his traditions didn't matter. Her mother standing at her side and nodding in agreement and interjecting occasionally with a \"that's right\" or \"you tell him\".\n\nHe was pleading (in a good attempt to be quiet, but was obviously frustrated) for her to at least compromise to let him at least *invite* his pastor from his home town for the wedding, and that their (non-existent) children could possibly do things with his parents for Christmas, even if they didn't celebrate.\n\nThe guests just kept partying, pretending nothing was happening, but you could see on all of their faces that they wanted to leave, but couldn't since they would have to pass by the couple to get to the only exit.\n\nOnly after two hours and the argument eventually devolving in to her INSISTING her children would never see a Christmas tree in their whole lives so they wouldn't be confused (good luck with that one in this country, lady) the groom finally, dejectedly said \"Well then maybe this isn't going to work.\"\n\nShe threw her ring at him and said, (I swear to god) \"THEN WHY THE HELL DID YOU LET ME MAKE YOU PROPOSE?!?!?!?!?!?!\" She then changed her mind, picked up the ring and said \"Whatever. I'm keeping this.\" and stormed off. Her mother looked at her ex-potential-son-in-law, told him he was an idiot for letting her baby go, and went after her.\n\nI've NEVER seen a banquet room clear of people so fast. Within fifteen minutes, everyone was gone, and it was a ghost town, and from the looks of it, everyone took their \"Gifts\" with them.\n\nWorse still, it was the former-bride's family who had hosted and were staying at the hotel, so we spend the next two days \"commiserating\" with them about how awful the groom was as they moved their daughter out of his apartment.\n\nDude dodged a bullet.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work at a hotel that does a huge amount of wedding business, and we had an engagement shower with the plan being that the couple would be having the wedding with us as well.

The MOB was your stereotypical Brooklyn Jewish Mother and had her hand in EVERYTHING to make sure things were perfect for her little princess. (My experience has shown that the MOB/MOG are exponentially worse than the actual people getting married.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, the engagement party starts, and everyone, except for the couple, seem to be having a great time. Then, halfway through the party, we suddenly heard the girl scream at her fiancee &amp;quot;WE WILL &lt;strong&gt;NEVER&lt;/strong&gt; HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE IN &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; HOUSE, SO YOU CAN GET OVER IT!!!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And from there it devolved into a shouting match between the couple, who moved from the banquet room to the lobby so their &amp;quot;guests&amp;quot; couldn&amp;#39;t hear the argument. (Didn&amp;#39;t work. They heard everything.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently she was Jewish and he was Protestant and not once in their relationship had they discussed religion. They went at it on and off for two hours. She was screaming at the top of her lungs about how their (non-existent) children would be raised Jewish, and how his traditions didn&amp;#39;t matter. Her mother standing at her side and nodding in agreement and interjecting occasionally with a &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s right&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;you tell him&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was pleading (in a good attempt to be quiet, but was obviously frustrated) for her to at least compromise to let him at least &lt;em&gt;invite&lt;/em&gt; his pastor from his home town for the wedding, and that their (non-existent) children could possibly do things with his parents for Christmas, even if they didn&amp;#39;t celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The guests just kept partying, pretending nothing was happening, but you could see on all of their faces that they wanted to leave, but couldn&amp;#39;t since they would have to pass by the couple to get to the only exit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only after two hours and the argument eventually devolving in to her INSISTING her children would never see a Christmas tree in their whole lives so they wouldn&amp;#39;t be confused (good luck with that one in this country, lady) the groom finally, dejectedly said &amp;quot;Well then maybe this isn&amp;#39;t going to work.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She threw her ring at him and said, (I swear to god) &amp;quot;THEN WHY THE HELL DID YOU LET ME MAKE YOU PROPOSE?!?!?!?!?!?!&amp;quot; She then changed her mind, picked up the ring and said &amp;quot;Whatever. I&amp;#39;m keeping this.&amp;quot; and stormed off. Her mother looked at her ex-potential-son-in-law, told him he was an idiot for letting her baby go, and went after her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve NEVER seen a banquet room clear of people so fast. Within fifteen minutes, everyone was gone, and it was a ghost town, and from the looks of it, everyone took their &amp;quot;Gifts&amp;quot; with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worse still, it was the former-bride&amp;#39;s family who had hosted and were staying at the hotel, so we spend the next two days &amp;quot;commiserating&amp;quot; with them about how awful the groom was as they moved their daughter out of his apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dude dodged a bullet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_7wtpoa", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/7wtpoa/wedding_shop_workers_what_are_your_worst/du3ytdw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7wtpoa/wedding_shop_workers_what_are_your_worst/", "name": "t1_du3ytdw", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1518403682.0, "created_utc": 1518403682.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7wtpoa/wedding_shop_workers_what_are_your_worst/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34iym", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "There has been talk at the PTA that a retiring 1st grade teacher (my kid's teacher) is going to be replaced by a new teacher who is also a MtF transgender.
