All women don't love buying $700 bags, and all men don't want to buy $700 rims. It's pretty inaccurate/insulting to make blanket statements about either. \n\nSecond off, knockoffs and 'real' bags are **not** at all the same. I've owned plenty of knockoffs of a variety of brands (including Coach) as well as a variety of 'real' bags (also including Coach), and the real ones are CONSISTENTLY better quality items that are not only more appealing visually, but they hold up for MUCH, much longer. In the long term, a 'real' bag almost always ends up saving you money (due to the increased longevity of the bag), as well as resources, as you're not just buying a cheap bag and tossing it in a landfill after 2 months of use.  (And yes, there *are* notable visual differences  to real versus knockoffs -- most women who are into this sort of thing can tell the difference instantly.) So generally, it's a better choice financially and environmentally. \n\nAdditionally, in general, the 'real' bags are from far more traceable origins. You can usually find out where the bag comes from, where the materials are sourced, and where it's made. That isn't to say that some of them don't come from nasty sweatshops in China, but usually with the real ones, you have the option to research the conditions they're manufactured in, and decide whether to buy one or not based on that fact. With knockoffs, you can **never** know for sure, and it's usually safe to assume that they weren't manufactured in favorable (or at least not offensive) conditions. The price of knockoffs are [generally] cheaper for a reason. \n\nThirdly, I won't try to justify $700 for this particular bag, as I know nothing about it, but the specific price isn't really the question here any way. The only important thing here, for argument's sake, is that it's a big number for the majority of us to shell out at any given time..\n\nSimply put, people can spend money on whatever the fuck they want. Maybe you'd choose to spend that money on some fancy new graphics card, or to donate it to a needing charity, or on a fucking bedazzled toilet -- it doesn't really matter. People have the right to spend their money as they please without your criticism. It just comes down to what people value. If she values a $700 purse over $700 spent on something else, then that's what she values. Maybe she sees your suggestions as equally warped. Granted, obviously it may be more practical to spend the money on only necessities, but most of us are guilty of spending money on luxury items anyway, in one form or another. (Luxury here meaning not entirely necessary for everyday life.) \n\ntl;dr: They aren't the same. There's a lot about buying a real bag that usually makes it more economical and more environmentally / worker-friendly. That, and who are you to judge how she, or any one else spends? You've probably done it, too. ", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I&amp;#39;m pretty disgusted by the level of ignorance in a lot of these comments -- particularly those badmouthing this woman in particular for buying the purse in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, it&amp;#39;s beyond silly to generalize all women. All women don&amp;#39;t love buying $700 bags, and all men don&amp;#39;t want to buy $700 rims. It&amp;#39;s pretty inaccurate/insulting to make blanket statements about either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second off, knockoffs and &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; bags are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; at all the same. I&amp;#39;ve owned plenty of knockoffs of a variety of brands (including Coach) as well as a variety of &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; bags (also including Coach), and the real ones are CONSISTENTLY better quality items that are not only more appealing visually, but they hold up for MUCH, much longer. In the long term, a &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; bag almost always ends up saving you money (due to the increased longevity of the bag), as well as resources, as you&amp;#39;re not just buying a cheap bag and tossing it in a landfill after 2 months of use.  (And yes, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; notable visual differences  to real versus knockoffs -- most women who are into this sort of thing can tell the difference instantly.) So generally, it&amp;#39;s a better choice financially and environmentally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in general, the &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; bags are from far more traceable origins. You can usually find out where the bag comes from, where the materials are sourced, and where it&amp;#39;s made. That isn&amp;#39;t to say that some of them don&amp;#39;t come from nasty sweatshops in China, but usually with the real ones, you have the option to research the conditions they&amp;#39;re manufactured in, and decide whether to buy one or not based on that fact. With knockoffs, you can &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; know for sure, and it&amp;#39;s usually safe to assume that they weren&amp;#39;t manufactured in favorable (or at least not offensive) conditions. The price of knockoffs are [generally] cheaper for a reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, I won&amp;#39;t try to justify $700 for this particular bag, as I know nothing about it, but the specific price isn&amp;#39;t really the question here any way. The only important thing here, for argument&amp;#39;s sake, is that it&amp;#39;s a big number for the majority of us to shell out at any given time..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simply put, people can spend money on whatever the fuck they want. Maybe you&amp;#39;d choose to spend that money on some fancy new graphics card, or to donate it to a needing charity, or on a fucking bedazzled toilet -- it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter. People have the right to spend their money as they please without your criticism. It just comes down to what people value. If she values a $700 purse over $700 spent on something else, then that&amp;#39;s what she values. Maybe she sees your suggestions as equally warped. Granted, obviously it may be more practical to spend the money on only necessities, but most of us are guilty of spending money on luxury items anyway, in one form or another. (Luxury here meaning not entirely necessary for everyday life.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: They aren&amp;#39;t the same. There&amp;#39;s a lot about buying a real bag that usually makes it more economical and more environmentally / worker-friendly. That, and who are you to judge how she, or any one else spends? You&amp;#39;ve probably done it, too. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_hokhi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/pics/comments/hokhi/asked_gf_what_made_her_700_coach_purse_different/c1x4b7d/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/hokhi/asked_gf_what_made_her_700_coach_purse_different/", "name": "t1_c1x4b7d", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1306903090.0, "created_utc": 1306903090.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://i.imgur.com/st4L0.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Basically.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "funny", "link_author": "pnkmnk", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c1unxhw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "aionat", "num_comments": 910, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_hdrv5", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_52kud", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I question the character of the women you are courting.
