And she has this foreknowledge and is able to change the future by not hooking up with her man-friend, and thus not bringing a doomed child into the world. She and her man-friend have a conflict about this (IIRC) she doesn't tell him, and so he isn't aware of this vision she had and I think he leaves her or the relationship fails because of it. But ultimately she makes the decision to not change the future and to bring that child into the world even with that doomed future. Ben interprets this as basically the most pro-life movie he has ever seen, because Amy Adams' character chooses life even though it's not perfect. He likens it to people aborting when they discover a child is going to have some kind of disability or disease. And his point is that she sees the future and it's not perfect and decides to bring that life into the world anyway. And according to him, the left thinks you have to abort any fetus that isn't perfect, if a baby is going to have any slight problem, or hey your life circumstances suck right now so the baby won't have a great home life, anything like that, the left says you have to abort. What ben fails to realize, still, is that pro-choice doesn't mean \"pro kill all the bb.\" Pro-choice is pro...women having a choice. And in the film Amy Adams has a choice. And that's just fine. She has a dilemma, and she gets to make up her own mind, and it's not some old man in a legislature or an asshole doctor making that decision for her.  !&lt;", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;well according to him, it&amp;#39;s pro-life because &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Amy Adams character is able to see the future, and sees that she is going to have a child, and that child will get sick and die when she&amp;#39;s like 18. And she has this foreknowledge and is able to change the future by not hooking up with her man-friend, and thus not bringing a doomed child into the world. She and her man-friend have a conflict about this (IIRC) she doesn&amp;#39;t tell him, and so he isn&amp;#39;t aware of this vision she had and I think he leaves her or the relationship fails because of it. But ultimately she makes the decision to not change the future and to bring that child into the world even with that doomed future. Ben interprets this as basically the most pro-life movie he has ever seen, because Amy Adams&amp;#39; character chooses life even though it&amp;#39;s not perfect.
