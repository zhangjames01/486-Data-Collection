People rightfully panicked right from the beginning and as a result local level bureaucracies are almost forced to release any confirmed and suspected cases down to exact locations each day - this literally happened in Shanghai where the daily reports started including district info since Jan 27 and started releasing more info about confirmed patients like age, place of dwelling and past activities/routes starting from Feb I think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t want to visit actual online communities in China, just go to expat subs like &lt;a href=\"/r/Shanghai\"&gt;r/Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"/r/Beijing\"&gt;r/Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, and read their experience about quarantine, semi-closed neighborhoods, being allowed to go outside only once a day (per household in some cases), bulk-ordering food and stuff, working from home, etc.. People &lt;em&gt;WILL&lt;/em&gt; share videos or photos of hazmat squads and disinfection activities because their life quite literally depend on it. In order for the numbers to be falsified/info to be oppressed, you not only need each level of bureaucracy be in on the ruse, you also need quite literally every single facet of the community (neighborhoods, supermarkets, delivery services, and more importantly hospital and medical resources) to be falsified as well because again, the measures have been extreme and &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; using those kind of measures result in Wuhan-level breakout, which will be impossible for you to not hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_f91nxi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/China_Flu/comments/f91nxi/where_are_all_the_voices_from_inside_china/fip4ji2/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f91nxi/where_are_all_the_voices_from_inside_china/", "name": "t1_fip4ji2", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/China_Flu", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1582597866.0, "created_utc": 1582597866.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f91nxi/where_are_all_the_voices_from_inside_china/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2dar36", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Proof of cooked books: Japanese man who died in Wuhan was initially listed as dying from 'viral pneumonia' and wasn't in the official death count", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "China_Flu", "link_author": "DeWallenVanWimKok", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fh6tnvv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "fall_ark", "num_comments": 412, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fh4ey8p", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4akf4", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Basically RNA positive + ground-glass lesion in lungs = confirmed.\n\n[Here's the official pdf in Chinese](http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/zhengceku/2020-01/29/5472893/files/2efb7f97b77d42d6bf4baba8569ac73c.pdf), the part for diagnosis is on page 10-12. \n\n&gt;\uff08\u4e8c\uff09\u786e\u8bca\u75c5\u4f8b\u3002\n&gt;\u7591\u4f3c\u75c5\u4f8b\u5177\u5907\u4ee5\u4e0b\u75c5\u539f\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u4e4b\u4e00\u8005\uff1a\n&gt;1.\u547c\u5438\u9053\u6807\u672c\u6216\u8840\u6db2\u6807\u672c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8367\u5149 RT-PCR \u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6838\u9178\u9633\u6027\uff1b\n&gt;2.\u75c5\u6bd2\u57fa\u56e0\u6d4b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u9ad8\u5ea6\u540c\u6e90\u3002\n\nEvery suspected case gets confirmed if 1) PCR test positive or 2) genome sequence done.\n\nSuspect case standard is bit more complex.
