As society goes further left and further to the side of lionizing VICTIMS and demonizing brave people, he&amp;#39;s saying &amp;#39;guys it&amp;#39;s alright to be a alpha, don&amp;#39;t apologize&amp;#39;. Now there&amp;#39;s a difference between bragging and standing up for what&amp;#39;s right. Perhaps he doesn&amp;#39;t walk that line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as Elon Musk and bill maher and others have said. They&amp;#39;ve stayed liberal, the left has moved to cloud coocoo land. So Tim maybe has moved more right to combat the left. But our man jocko is just so secure in his beliefs he&amp;#39;s just stayed like a mountain as always.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_m0l3zk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/JockoPodcast/comments/m0l3zk/anyone_else_think_tim_kennedy_is_an_absolute/ih815gr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JockoPodcast/comments/m0l3zk/anyone_else_think_tim_kennedy_is_an_absolute/", "name": "t1_ih815gr", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/JockoPodcast", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1658514938.0, "created_utc": 1658514938.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JockoPodcast/comments/m0l3zk/anyone_else_think_tim_kennedy_is_an_absolute/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2lxrwr", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Alex Hormozi ripoff Gym/Marketing Guru thoughts?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Coffeezilla_gg", "link_author": "karmics______", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "idcgbqb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Trenks", "num_comments": 294, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_idb2wqw", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4oorw", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "He invites anyone making 3-5m+ in revenue to APPLY.
