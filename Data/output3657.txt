Unless they perceive the possibility of a loss, why would they pay you more?  Businessmen (the people who hire others to do research and then make poor decisions based on their under-educated status) certainly aren't going to take your quality of life into consideration - that's not money for them.\n\nRemember that, while perhaps a bit of an over dramatization, employment really is a struggle between the worker and the business.  They (probably) want you to give them everything you have for nothing.  You'd (probably) like to give them reasonable work for reasonable pay.\n\nIf you operate under the assumption that it's a \"privilege\" to work, or that your job is special, you'll end up in the weaker position.  Never let your boss tell you (and never make any assumptions that) there's some sort of reward to your job OTHER than pay.  While work and accomplishment is personally rewarding, it's the act of \"getting it done\" that provides that, and your boss just wants you to think you'll never work anywhere other than here, so you'd better make a commitment.  But you can become a fulfilled, productive person anywhere, doing anything.\n\n*In reality, you should find a better job.*  If I find a company or position where the managers broadcast this idea where you get places by working hard - I walk out.  Start at the bottom, work your way up!  Right!  Right?\n\nExcept that hard work doesn't get you raises (anymore), and it doesn't progress your career (anymore).  And if you assume that you should always work hard because that's what \"good people\" do, you're going to be abused by your employer.  These are the ideals of the old world, which had a very different reality regarding business.  You're suffering under the situation of the double-standard.  Others want you to work harder and harder for them, but they don't want to pay you properly for it.  Does it sound like they have any ground to tell you you are or aren't working hard enough?\n\nSo what's fair?  Where is the line between sensible self interest and laziness?  That's something you have to decide for yourself.  But remember:\n\n- Even if they think you're a hard worker, they won't pay you more just for that\n- Even if you've been employed at a company for 15 years, they won't keep you around just for that\n- Even if you do everything you can to spend your time and life to help the company, they won't pay you more just for that\n\nI suppose, my bottom line is this: your company doesn't care you about you.  Hopefully the people there do - your boss or manager, your coworkers.  But the people who decide what you get paid probably don't.\n\nYou need to care about you.  You need to find a job that you don't hate - so that you can dedicate yourself to working it regularly and with vigor - and focus on that.  You need to expand your own skill set, and create a place for yourself within your company that is invaluable - by solving problems, and by getting things done.  This doesn't necessarily always mean overtime, it means being minded towards practicality.\n\nSo, find a new job.  Write yourself a resume that has exactly, in direct and short language, the parts of your job.  Then take what you have there, and make a new resume - with NONE of that information on it.  If you would write that you work a machine, you probably have to deal with that machine's faults and malfunctions, right?  \"On-the-job, fast machine maintenance and repair\".  Sometimes it doesn't work the way it should, so you have to find a work-around, right?  \"Problem solving skills, focused on production flow.\"\n\nRemember that things that make you valuable aren't your cut-and-paste job description lines.  The things that make you valuable are everything you do on a daily basis to make things work where they otherwise might not.\n\nOnce you find a new place at comparable (hopefully better) wage, let your boss know.  \"I've gotten an offer from another company\".  They'll either tell you: (1) good luck or (2) please don't go, we need you.  You'll benefit either way.\n\nFinal notes: generally it's polite to let your boss know you're looking for another job.  If you're an underpaid factory worker, I wouldn't really recommend this.  Still give them the 2 weeks notice before you leave for another job, and definitely talk to your boss BEFORE you tell them you're leaving.  But it might not be a great idea to share that you're looking around, unless you already feel that your position there is appropriately valued by management.\n\n\nGood luck, stay sane.

You&amp;#39;ll benefit either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Final notes: generally it&amp;#39;s polite to let your boss know you&amp;#39;re looking for another job.  If you&amp;#39;re an underpaid factory worker, I wouldn&amp;#39;t really recommend this.  Still give them the 2 weeks notice before you leave for another job, and definitely talk to your boss BEFORE you tell them you&amp;#39;re leaving.  But it might not be a great idea to share that you&amp;#39;re looking around, unless you already feel that your position there is appropriately valued by management.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck, stay sane.
