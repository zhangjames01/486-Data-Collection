Yes in a perfect world we would take the actual data, compare it to model output and over time come up with a better model output. At the surface this is an entirely reasonable assumption but a number of different factors play into it. The first, to my mind is that the actual point location in the model doesn't exactly have the same representative point location in reality. What I mean by that is the surface of the earth within the model is highly idealised and only in the last few decades started to take into account soil type depth and variance in (to a greater or lesser degree) vegetation (for example it didn't vary vegetation according to the season, it ajusts to an aggregate value). you can see how just this point alone can add in a systematic bias in the output. (Admittedly I'm not 100% up to date with current surface modelling within numerical modelling so perhaps a data scientist that knows a hell of a lot more than me explain quite why it's so tricky to add in this to the model scheme. I know at least for the UK Met Office we took several years to add in a representative \"floor\" to the model that helped with some of that local detail. \n\nSecondly and kinda linked is that the spacial resolution of models is still measured in KM or with more localised ones 100s of M. Again variations in temperature can be aggregated out and hot spots can be missed, this works in the vertical plane too, if your site has a very steep south facing hill but it's a relatively small feature. The hill may not be exactly where the grid point is (which may be an average of the grid space). Again I'm not sure how spectral models deal with this so someone else might be able to explain this. \n\nAnd thirdly there may be some specific conditions which give these results so you can't plug in a coefficient to add 2 degrees to this one site because then you might miss cooler temperatures. So better to have it somewhere consistent within the model and then a forecaster looking at the output adds an amount based on experience or experimental data collected for the site. \n\nTo add all this up an example that springs to mind is a local airfield that I have done specialized forecasts for, where the local effects lead to it being a frost hollow. But exactly why that is is down to some fairly unique factors. \n\nFirstly the local soil type is sandy so any moisture quicky drains away to a local river (which coincidentally leads to fog forming over the area where the model wouldn't have it as it doesn't represent the river in the right place). Another factor is that the site is located in a small valley with some 'relatively' steep hills either side, this both shelters the site in certain directions and also causes a katabatic wind to form over night, further reducing the temperature. \n\nThis all means on a clear calm night temperatures can drop up to 6 or 7 degrees below what the model might expect the temperature the grid space over might get down to. And although the model can have a relatively good idea of when these conditions might be met to add in a fudge factor, it quite frequently underestimates the drop. Now we do have less 'smart' temperature forecasts which take a little model data and a little of the previous nights error and attempts a 'best guess' but this can still be wrong. And on nights after a particular cold spell can get the error the other way, giving a colder temperature than you would expect from the conditions.\n\nFrom experience the thing that works like a charm is an experiential data set of clear calm nights (collected over about 30 years) to come up with temperature curves for the site. But this needs to be used intelligently by a forecaster as to when to crack out the temp curves or is the night not suitable for them. \n\nThis kind of local nuance is something we will start approaching being able to pick out but for the time being it's where humans still add value to forecast output.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s an interesting point and one I&amp;#39;d like to explore a bit further.
