I hope you enjoyed it.  Did you have leftover rice?  If not try making a larger amount of rice next time so you do have leftovers!  The rice sits in the fridge overnight.  This is important.  The next day you put the rice in a frying pan or wok (if you have one) with a touch of oil.  Mix that stuff up nice.  When it's gotten warm crack 1-2 eggs over it and mix that in.  Now fry that stuff up.  You got some leftover veggies?  Chuck 'em in there.  Some garlic?  Onion?  It's all good.. Now put a little soy sauce in till you get a nice color/flavor and eat it up.  Delicious.  One of my good friends is Korean.
