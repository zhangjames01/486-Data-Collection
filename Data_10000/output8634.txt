"removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Turning a profit is not that rare, I can just about guarantee that any haunt that\u2019s been running for more than 3 years that operates out of a commercial property (not a home/garage haunt) is pulling in a profit. It might not necessarily be huge profits, but any haunt that survives past their first season and adds on upgrades every year will usually be in the green after around their 3rd season - unless they put every penny back in for large upgrades &amp; marketing, but even then they\u2019ll be super-profitable eventually as long as their visitor count each year continually increases. \n\nThe really big name haunts that have been open for 10-20+ years are more than likely bringing in significant money every season, there\u2019s usually at least 1 super well-known haunt in every state and many states have 3+ haunts that dominate their local areas. Seven-figure profits, season after season, are a relatively easy number to get to as long as your marketing is top-notch and if your whole operation is well-oiled enough to smoothly put through big numbers of customers every night. \n\nThat being said, most haunt-owners handle most of their marketing decisions themselves. They\u2019ll hire out contractors for creative stuff (videos/graphics) but likely write their own copy and/or keep it simple, and work with the same contractors every year\u2026 So finding a big name haunt with deep pockets who\u2019s willing to pay serious money for writers when they\u2019re already well-established and know what works for them could potentially be pretty difficult.
