This will help you naturally and safely enter the roll without hitting the side of your head or crushing your shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With proper placement a &amp;quot;worst case&amp;quot; scenario should have the side of your head hitting your hands or arm instead of the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Landing a dive roll with hands on both sides of your head like a handstand greatly increases the chance of a face plant or knocking the side of your head, which can cause serious injury on concrete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On arm control - try to reach out all the way and use your arms to absorb some of the initial impact. Great way to practice this is doing plyo push-ups with your legs up on progressively higher things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love that you&amp;#39;re learning on grass rather than a thick mat - listen to all the feedback from your body about which parts are hitting the ground. That height of dive roll should be pretty low impact / painless on grass.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_k9i754", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Parkour/comments/k9i754/hey_guys_heres_a_dive_roll_i_did_and_i_wanted_to/gf5s4jc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkour/comments/k9i754/hey_guys_heres_a_dive_roll_i_did_and_i_wanted_to/", "name": "t1_gf5s4jc", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Parkour", "author_flair_text": "APK DC Instructor since 2013, training since 2009", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1607515754.0, "created_utc": 1607515754.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://v.redd.it/u82x84dng2461"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Trump just fired the head of the NNSA, the agency that oversees our nuclear weapons safety", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "link_author": "memoryballhs", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gbi34pa", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "trackpete", "num_comments": 992, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gbgd7i5", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5ac0y", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;I don't worry so much about that, because obviously all of them can be re-hired in just a few months. \n\nUnfortunately hiring for civil service positions isn't like hiring in the private sector, which is why this is so nefarious when civil servants (not appointees) are asked to quit: most of these positions are Competitive Service and you can't just hire who you want in. \n\nThe rules for hiring in these positions are weird and it's entirely likely that someone who previously held it would be deemed \"less qualified\" than other candidates during review.
