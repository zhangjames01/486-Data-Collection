Quick simple suggestion, once in Oji, you could ride the Sakura Tram (Toden Arakawa line). The only tram still running (technically there is another but it does not share the road with cars, whereas the Sakura tram does, for a couple meters). You&amp;#39;ll see parts of Tokyo at a leisurely pace, usually not visited by many tourists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11t5mos", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/JapanTravel/comments/11t5mos/advice_on_my_schedule_for_japan_needed_leaving_in/jci9nlo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/11t5mos/advice_on_my_schedule_for_japan_needed_leaving_in/", "name": "t1_jci9nlo", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/JapanTravel", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679013796.0, "created_utc": 1679013796.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/11t5mos/advice_on_my_schedule_for_japan_needed_leaving_in/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uylr", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Advice on my schedule for Japan needed!

There aren't many places in Tokyo that are over 20 mins by foot from any given station, and 6 mins from the airport is ... still very, very close to the airport, likely in Ota ward. So 30 mins on foot, 6 mins from the airport, besides trying to go on purpose to industrial zones such as Jonanjima, I just don't see what kind of place that can be, and more importantly WHY you picked up that place. You'll be exhausted, so walking 30 mins with your luggage seems like a super bad idea. There is nothing to gain by doing that, taking the train or the bus and in 30 mins you'll be pretty much anywhere near a decent hotel.\n\nMarch 20th, you go back and forth, touching areas you'll be visiting later (eg, Hanazono shrine is just a couple meters away from Kabukicho. Mejiro Garden... Why? (I mean, it's a fine little garden out of the usual tourist path, but it'll be over in a few minutes). You may want to try Rokugien if you want a more spacious Japanese garden in which to spend more time.\n\nMarch 23rd, Hie Shrine, again, why ? I've seen this one popped up in a couple touristic itineraries, I wonder how it is described. It's an important shrine in terms of spiritual meaning, but it is not what I would call \"interesting\" for a tourist visiting the country. It is a modern complex with a large concrete torii (and escalators next to the steps). In the area, maybe Toyokawa Inari may be a bit more rewarding \"touristically speaking\". Even Yasukuni will be more interesting.\n\nMarch 25th: Asukayama and Oji... Here too, I'm interested about the \"why\". Interesting area, it's basically the oldest park in Tokyo, and there are some historical relics (residence of Shibusawa Eichi, museum of paper, etc.), but it's more the kind of place you'll see in the itinerary of someone who visited the country 10 times and wants to go deeper.\n\nBut then...
