While I was pregnant my husband (then fiance) and I started pricing out daycares thinking that I would go back to my job after I gave birth. We have a total of 3 to pick from that aren't over an hour 1 way. All 3 of them, for our single infant, were over $350 per week. When I was working I only brought home, on average, $400 per week. By the time I'd factor in the extra gas I'd be bringing home little to nothing, if not actually working full time for negative money (if we had chosen the furthest day care center that had the best reviews, but was further to drive daily and cost more overall).\n\nSo we stayed being a 1 income family for a while. Before my second was born I finished my degree and worked part time (only a handful of hours per week, no more then 3 hours per day, they didn't need a whole lot) for my husband's workplace doing light office work and some accounting. But that position got moved to the head office, so that didn't last long. But we were able to get a babysitter while I did that bit of work. I made $16 an hour and we paid the babysitter $10 an hour. Accounting for travel time, because even when I was off the clock the babysitter still obviously got paid for the time it took me to travel to her house, I pocketed $1 per hour that I worked. Literally all of that went into my gas. By the time I had my second we knew I wouldn't be returning to work. I would have still been making $16 an hour but paying $15 an hour (her rates were that every kid after the first was $5 more an hour) just for the babysitter, not including the extra $5 a day in travel time it took for me to get to her place.\n\nSo I do the stay at home parent thing. We balance our budget very carefully and, other than our mortgage, are living debt free. Sure, we could send the kids to daycare and I work for pennies, but for my husband and I, it's not worth it. I haven't had a full time job since 2014. But beyond the money, I think a lot of families are finally able to be actively involved in their kids baby and toddler years more so than in the past decade thanks to Covid. So many parents have been allowed to work from home and be with their kids more and so many have found it more rewarding than their jobs. So when jobs start pulling back on working from home, a lot of families are prioritizing their time with their children over the, possibly miniscule, amount of money they'd bring home by sending their kids to daycare.\n\nFor a lot of families too it's sometimes easier to say it's for financial reasons. Some people in society have weird views on people choosing to stay home with their kids, especially if it means a total net loss of money (because how will you ever be fulfilled without money in this society /s), and saying it's because of money is often less open to arguments than \"I just want to be with my kids/I don't want others raising my kids/ any other reason a family might choose not to send a child to daycare\".\n\nOverall it comes down to every family having to make the best choice for them. I know parents who do work for essentially negative money that choose daycare for their own mental wellbeing and desire to continue their job/career and that is what they value for their family. I know other families who knowingly took a huge pay cut just so one parent could stay home because that is what they value for their family.
