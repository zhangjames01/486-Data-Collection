Fake war no wmds. In that meantime. The government was funding private armies, getting charged ridiculous amounts of money( 100$, for a load of laundry) . the Taliban in Afghanistan were still making 20 million + a year in opium profits during the occupation.\n\nWhat oil in Afghanistan?  What oil did the US *ever* extract from Afghanistan??  And how is this, in any way, supposed to suggest that Russia invading Ukraine is a *good* thing?\n\nIs the argument \"the US killed millions in the past, so it should now let Russia kill millions in the present\"??\n\n&gt;What a joke. Fake heroism at the price of soldiers and civilian lives so a few can enrich themselves and keep their interests going. Ukraine is the same deal. Oil industry. Military industry getting that $$$ while you eat the fake media cake. \n\nSo your argument is that Iraq and Afghanistan should have been fully annexed by the US and that the wars were not only justifiable, but *their* fault for daring to fight back in the first place?\n\nIf Ukraine's the \"same thing\", and the US invasion of those two countries were *bad* and just a bid for *resource extraction*, then presumably the *best* thing for Ukraine to do is *fight back*.  Just as Iraq and Afghanistan did.\n\n&gt;All that propaganda showing Russia being **weak and fragile at the beginning of this war**. Redditers were one of the dweebs who kept eating the media cake. Then it just kept going and going lmao. Russia is now signing deals with China and the middle east. They are stronger than they have ever been.\n\nWhat?  At the start everyone, including western observers, were suggesting Russia would run right over Ukraine.  It's only *since* the beginning of the war that the mask has finally fallen off and we're able to see where all Russia's military spending went.\n\nLike to boats currently in possession with the Spanish authorities.\n\nI certainly didn't know about Rostec's CEO's personal yacht before the war.\n\nRussia was originally compared to the US before the war.  That ain't happening anymore.  And if the US failed to gain anything of value for its decades long conflicts, what hope does Russia have?\n\n\"It's about oil, or gas!\"\n\nOk, well, where's the production?  What's the profit margin on gas versus a war?  Did the US really benefit from Iraq and Afghanistan?  If not, then what hope does Russia have to benefit from this?\n\nAre they somehow immune from the costs of a war while the US isn't?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NATO stopped Zelensky from even getting to the negotiating table. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where did you read this?

The government was funding private armies, getting charged ridiculous amounts of money( 100$, for a load of laundry) . the Taliban in Afghanistan were still making 20 million + a year in opium profits during the occupation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What oil in Afghanistan?  What oil did the US &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; extract from Afghanistan??  And how is this, in any way, supposed to suggest that Russia invading Ukraine is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the argument &amp;quot;the US killed millions in the past, so it should now let Russia kill millions in the present&amp;quot;??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What a joke. Fake heroism at the price of soldiers and civilian lives so a few can enrich themselves and keep their interests going. Ukraine is the same deal. Oil industry. Military industry getting that $$$ while you eat the fake media cake. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your argument is that Iraq and Afghanistan should have been fully annexed by the US and that the wars were not only justifiable, but &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; fault for daring to fight back in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;same thing&amp;quot;, and the US invasion of those two countries were &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; and just a bid for &lt;em&gt;resource extraction&lt;/em&gt;, then presumably the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; thing for Ukraine to do is &lt;em&gt;fight back&lt;/em&gt;.  Just as Iraq and Afghanistan did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All that propaganda showing Russia being &lt;strong&gt;weak and fragile at the beginning of this war&lt;/strong&gt;. Redditers were one of the dweebs who kept eating the media cake. Then it just kept going and going lmao. Russia is now signing deals with China and the middle east. They are stronger than they have ever been.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What?  At the start everyone, including western observers, were suggesting Russia would run right over Ukraine.  It&amp;#39;s only &lt;em&gt;since&lt;/em&gt; the beginning of the war that the mask has finally fallen off and we&amp;#39;re able to see where all Russia&amp;#39;s military spending went.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like to boats currently in possession with the Spanish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I certainly didn&amp;#39;t know about Rostec&amp;#39;s CEO&amp;#39;s personal yacht before the war.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Russia was originally compared to the US before the war.  That ain&amp;#39;t happening anymore.  And if the US failed to gain anything of value for its decades long conflicts, what hope does Russia have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s about oil, or gas!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, well, where&amp;#39;s the production?  What&amp;#39;s the profit margin on gas versus a war?  Did the US really benefit from Iraq and Afghanistan?  If not, then what hope does Russia have to benefit from this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are they somehow immune from the costs of a war while the US isn&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11r2db6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/11r2db6/ron_desantis_says_protecting_ukraine_is_not_a_key/jco625x/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/11r2db6/ron_desantis_says_protecting_ukraine_is_not_a_key/", "name": "t1_jco625x", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/UkrainianConflict", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679123851.0, "created_utc": 1679123851.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/us/politics/ron-desantis-ukraine-tucker-carlson.html"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2v0c6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Video reportedly from the Su-27 fighter plane passing the US MQ-9 Reaper", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "CombatFootage", "link_author": "i7Gaming", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcf7h8v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "zaoldyeck", "num_comments": 54, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcf40ug", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4yftn", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It looks like a sun [low on the horizon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4hPwu3E6Rw).

You don't have to show anything, just accuse the other party of being \"willfully blind\".  Why not just say \"ur wrong\" and save yourself the typing?\n\n&gt;Chechnya I'd firmly with Russia, ask Kadyrov. Georgia and Moldova are in a similar spot, and lots of money is being funneled from abroad to destabilize them and keep them away from Russia. It will fail. Ukraine will not exist in ita current form 2 years from now and Russia will achieve everything they wanted, so it's irrelevant.\n\nThat doesn't sound very 'friendly' to me.  If you're arguing *friendship* it kinda helps to not want to eradicate a country.\n\n&gt;Ex Warsaw conference are known for their hate for Russia, you're not saying anything new here.\n\nYa think maybe there's a reason for that?  Kinda connected to the whole \"friendship\" thing?\n\nLike is Ukraine supposed to *like* the country currently invading them?  What part of that is offering 'friendship'?  Why do former colonies of the USSR tend to dislike Russia?  Think maybe there's some good reason for it?\n\n&gt;That they're American lapdogs? That's known to anyone with IQ above room temperature.\n\nWhat does this mean?  What is an \"American lapdog\"?  What is it with pro-Russia fans and their inability to understand *agency* in others?\n\n&gt;Very few, in fact? Given it's been banned all over? Do you even know what's happening in the world?\n\nYes, primarily by *not* spending my time consuming literal Russian state propaganda. It's truly difficult to find many *worse* sources.\n\n&gt;Or maybe it's seeking a different force of stabilization, after decades of \"stability guarantees\" from the West?\n\nWhat \"stability guarantees\"?? I'm just saying that under most definitions humans choose for the word 'stable', needing to hire outside mercenary groups generally *precludes* the vast majority.\n\n&gt;So brainwashed Redditors would start screaming wHaTaBoUtIsM. Only pointing out if you ever catch yourself doing the same. I'll address the point.\n\nYou're attempting to *defend Russia* by *criticizing* Spain.  While Russia does the *exact* same thing.  Your only consistent framing is \"Russia can do no wrong, the US can do no right\". \n\n&gt;Yes,that is what markets do. Fully aware of that. It doesn't change the fact Europe was screaming crying Russia is weaponizing food and the poor countries are suffering as a result. Well, that's the big fat lie Redditors swallowed wholesale. Poor countries were suffering because of rich countries feeding pigs rather than helping poor countries in a **moment of need**.\n\nYou mean rising prices *caused by* Putin's invasion of Ukraine???\n\nHe *created* the need.  How 'magnanimous' of him to then offer to 'help', unlike those mean old Europeans who instead helping Ukraine slaughter Russian soldiers.\n\n&gt;Russia has plenty of food for themselves which they produce. They can do whatever they want with it.\n\n&gt;That includes sending food AND fertilizer to poor countries FOR FREE, which they offered many times. **It was always blocked by the west.**\n\nOk you appear to have a massive problem with citations.  Realllly should learn to correct that.  Notice how I didn't need to be *asked* to cite the things I claim are true?  The things you just casually dismiss?\n\nAlso, once again, he *created* the need.  It's like shooting someone in the foot then asking them to thank you when you offer to take them to the hospital for free.\n\n&gt;Also, thought the sanctions were **supposed to starve the population and have them riot**. Guess that didn't work, did it?\n\nDear god what is with you people and citations?  When was that *ever* a claimed intent of *any* set of sanctions?  Which sanctions?  Cause \"starve Russians to death\" isn't exactly all that attractive even to *me*, and I'm pretty damn anti-Putin.\n\n&gt;Lol This **only speaks of sub zero level of self awareness**. Read my comment again, I already addressed your response.\n\nRather than the insult, mind spending the extra effort to help someone with \"zero level of self awareness\" (my god what an awkward construct) understand *how* invading a country isn't a terrible way to build 'friendship'?  Or is \"willingness\" not really important, Russia can murder whoever they want?\n\n&gt;Did you even understand what I said? In addition, since you mentioned subservience, Russia is being demonized by the West BECAUSE it dared NOT BE SUBSERVIENT to the the West. That's Putin's biggest sin, openly defying the West. He's showing the world it's very possible and the world is watching.\n\nWell, yes, it's entirely possible... by becoming subservient to China.  I don't particularly see how that stands to be much of an improvement. But \"is it possible to rely on China\" was demonstrated true thanks to North Korea.\n\nI'd rather live south of there right about now.\n\n&gt;Lololol You're consuming so much Western propaganda it's unbelievable. Just today a statistics came out - In Moscow the level of unemployment is 0.37%. **In IT there's 15 vacancies for every professional**.\n\nThat's... kinda indicative of a huge problem.  Holy crap if those numbers are real than Russia is absolutely *crippled* for any kind of educated workforce.\n\nIs *everyone* being killed in Ukraine, even from Moscow!?\n\nYou think Russia sending men by the hundreds of thousands to the military is going to result in *high* unemployment!?\n\nWho the hell let that statistic out?  I'd stay away from windows if I were them.\n\n&gt;I'll remind you that Russian scientists **were**/are HIGHLY in regard even in the US. Where, incidentally amongst mathematicians, a running joke is that mathematics is what Russian professors teach Chinese in American universities.\n\nYes, *were*.  The trope is of *Soviet* scientists.  The Soviet Union has been gone for 30 years now.  Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz are both quite dead now.\n\nThese days universities are being picked clean for able body individuals.  Leading to a hollowing out of professional fields, like IT.\n\n&gt;I think the Russians will be just fine , so long as they keep education at the current levels. It's America that should be VERY worried about education. The rest follows.\n\nRussia has [~250](https://www.alluniversity.info/russia/) colleges/universities in the entire country.  California has [over 400](https://www.bestcolleges.com/united-states/california/colleges/).\n\nRussia's population is 140 million.  California is 40 million.\n\nAnd the US isn't currently seeing hundreds of thousands of college students being killed a year.\n\nIf the US has to worry about a lack of a future educated workforce, Russia's beyond screwed.\n\n&gt;That's exactly what the West wants it to be, and they're saying no. Defiance to the west. See my comment above again.\n\nThe only act of *defiance* was *invading Ukraine*.  They're saying no to \"not invading Ukraine\".  And they're demonstrating that you get cut off from the west.  Lesson being \"if you only want China as your trading partner, feel free to attempt to annex your neighbor\".\n\nEven Azerbaijan didn't push for something like that.\n\n&gt;Ah, the ever present conclusion of an emotional rant. Well done.\n\n&gt;Fully American, FYI. Just not entirely brainwashed.\n\nSure buddy, RT is totally on the level, don't bother 'cross-referencing', just trust what Putin says.  Putin is right, Putin is god, Putin is love and justice.  All hail lord Putin, savior of Russia and the world.  No other opinion matters, not Ukraine's, not Sweden's, not Finland's, not Kazakhstan, not Uzbekistan, no, just Russia.\n\nAnything else is just plain brainwashing.

I&amp;#39;d stay away from windows if I were them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll remind you that Russian scientists &lt;strong&gt;were&lt;/strong&gt;/are HIGHLY in regard even in the US. Where, incidentally amongst mathematicians, a running joke is that mathematics is what Russian professors teach Chinese in American universities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt;.  The trope is of &lt;em&gt;Soviet&lt;/em&gt; scientists.  The Soviet Union has been gone for 30 years now.  Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz are both quite dead now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days universities are being picked clean for able body individuals.  Leading to a hollowing out of professional fields, like IT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think the Russians will be just fine , so long as they keep education at the current levels. It&amp;#39;s America that should be VERY worried about education. The rest follows.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Russia has &lt;a href=\"https://www.alluniversity.info/russia/\"&gt;~250&lt;/a&gt; colleges/universities in the entire country.  California has &lt;a href=\"https://www.bestcolleges.com/united-states/california/colleges/\"&gt;over 400&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;#39;s population is 140 million.  California is 40 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the US isn&amp;#39;t currently seeing hundreds of thousands of college students being killed a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the US has to worry about a lack of a future educated workforce, Russia&amp;#39;s beyond screwed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s exactly what the West wants it to be, and they&amp;#39;re saying no. Defiance to the west. See my comment above again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only act of &lt;em&gt;defiance&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;invading Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;.  They&amp;#39;re saying no to &amp;quot;not invading Ukraine&amp;quot;.  And they&amp;#39;re demonstrating that you get cut off from the west.  Lesson being &amp;quot;if you only want China as your trading partner, feel free to attempt to annex your neighbor&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Azerbaijan didn&amp;#39;t push for something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ah, the ever present conclusion of an emotional rant.
