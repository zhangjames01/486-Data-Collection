I hear this sob story every time someone argues against vote ID laws. In my state, someone that is so broke they can&amp;#39;t afford it is provided with an ID free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That &amp;quot;sob story&amp;quot; is a very valid concern for a lot of people in the country.  I hope you&amp;#39;re thankful that it&amp;#39;s never been an issue for you, because I know it sure as hell has been for me in the past.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd again, anecdotal evidence.  Not all states are your state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think both are a problem. They are unrelated and can be fixed independently of one another. People have been caught committing in person voter fraud. It is a simple crime that would be difficult to catch. Who knows how many get away with it?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main issue for me, and a lot of other people, is that the in-person cases of voter fraud are by and large individual acts (though I grant you that they in person cases are sprayed all over the media, everywhere, all the time until the next thing comes along).  Absentee voter fraud, however, has the potential (and has been done) on a larger scale. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Millions of absentee ballots are disregarded each election cycle for various reasons (including voter fraud) and that&amp;#39;s just the ones catch! Like you said, it&amp;#39;s a relatively easy crime to commit but a hard one to catch.  MILLIONS. \nComparatively, voter ID laws are not an effective way to eradicate voter fraud if you&amp;#39;re actually serious about eradicating voter fraud.  If you are, however, concerned with minimizing a cross-section of people that tend to vote a certain way then yes, voter ID laws can do that by putting an unreasonable burden on those people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1kvwpi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/news/comments/1kvwpi/united_states_to_sue_texas_over_voter/cbtfdu3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kvwpi/united_states_to_sue_texas_over_voter/", "name": "t1_cbtfdu3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1377220722.0, "created_utc": 1377220722.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-sue-texas-over-voter-id-law"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "United States to sue Texas over voter redistricting", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 11, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "news", "link_author": "aranasyn", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cbtbt97", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "thenamescash", "num_comments": 424, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cbtavwe", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_76vr9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I would be willing to bet that many of the people without ID don't actually hold jobs (most jobs require identification to set up tax withholding).
