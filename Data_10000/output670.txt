drive is they try to take in so much data when driving, to outside observers it appears like distraction.     \nA possible resolution to this is simply more time driving, as with more time you are able to covert concious effort into subconscious skill.    \nOne way to build some skills is to practice driving in limited contexts, like go carting.      \nWhere to focus of practice is to learn more about accurate turning, learning how to estimate stopping distance, amounts of braking force etc.       \nBy removing traffic from this subset of skills it might help you get better with these skills and build you up for when you are driving in traffic. \n\n\nYou'll need to pass about 100 hours before you can get your confidence up about general driving skill.\n\nAs for getting a license, change your focus from learning driving to learning to pass the test.   \nThese are two separate objectives and passing the practical test is a smaller, easier task to achieve. \n\nYour instructor should be focusing on you passing the test.      \nOne of the ways to do this is to use your time with the instructor to practice the test itself, repeatedly.
