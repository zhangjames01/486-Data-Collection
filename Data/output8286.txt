I was only able to ever make friends by winning people over a longer period of time when we were in forced proximity- classes together, work, clubs, etc. My personality's not sparkling enough to make someone want to be my friend despite fatness over the course of a single encounter. Even then, I accepted being the friend whose preferences didn't matter quite as much. I never relied on anyone else for anything- emotional support, moving apartments, ride from the airport, whatever, because I just didn't trust them to value me. Which has nothing to do with my friends or how they treated me, I think. The way I saw it, people value friends according to various metrics, and being the \"fat one\" meant that I was valued much less, so people would be much less willing to invest anything in keeping me as a friend.\n\nThis really hit home for me..I've always felt this way. Winning over a friend felt like climbing mount everest, and even once I had them, I felt  I was some token fat person in a group, a caricature of a human being...On the romantic side, I had always assumed no guy would ever be attracted to me, or even if they liked my personality and were attracted to me I assumed they would still never go for me and even if they did they wouldn't want to be with me in public.\n\nThis has led to considerable bitterness towards people, and also a cloying desperate niceness in hopes that someone will see through the fat that I am an intelligent and rather awesome person. \n\nAt one point in highschool I got down to about 135lbs (5'6\") and I did notice a considerable difference in how guys looked at me and how people treated me in public. This actually only made me feel more bitter, thoughts like \"These are the same people that ignored you when you were fat\" were abundent.\n\nAtm I'm at 185lbs, which has been the highest I've ever been, and it's been this way for the last 3 years. In the meantime I've met a wonderful (\"normal sized\") guy who absolutely loves me for who I am: body and personality. Finding a person who truly and honestly appreciates me as I am has made me have goals for my future and to feel generally happier and more up beat. My new-found cheerfulness has also led to people in public being nicer to me, I've realized that my weight wasn't the only thing holding me back, my anger, depression and lack of self confidence have also been huge roadblocks.\n\nThe 2 years I've been with my boyfriend have been a catalyst for very positive change in my life, and now with most of the emotional issues regarding my weight resolved, I'm probably in the right place to start resolving the physical ones as well... I finish University in two weeks, and I think this time I'll get the weight loss right too :)\n\nTL;DR weight issues spark emotional issues which spark a feedback loop of more eating and more depression. thank you sweet boyfriend for getting me out of the horrible spiral I was drowning in.
