Also before high school, I was known to be a klutz and had been called a \"space cadet\" plenty of times before. Hell, my own father even called me \"cockroach\" because of my very short attention span. Anyway, so a guy from Texas moved close to me; we'll call him Z. My parents and Z's parents formed a pretty good friendship before we finally went to high school together (8th grade for me). As mentioned above, I wanted to join the wrestling team and it turned out he did too! I was pretty excited because he was the closest thing I had made to a friend in years (I had a few close friends from elementary school). Well, things started to change pretty quickly. There were a group of kids in my neighborhood that I mostly hung out with due to proximity and also to wanting to learn some more social skills. I introduced (if I remember correctly) him to them and they became fast friends. Now these kids weren't exactly my type as they were part of a more \"popular\" group within my school, but I still hung out with them anyway. As the years went by I found the divide between myself and the neighborhood gang was growing ever greater. All they could talk about was some party they went to and who hooked up with who and who drank what and yadda yadda yadda. Well, as Z gets more entrenched with this group, it bleeds over to his personality around me as well. I start to notice that the neigborhood kids stop talking to me when I sit by them and don't invite to anything anymore. I notice that he rarely ever talks to me and if he does, it always seems a little off; I think patronizing is the best word to describe it. He's a bit older than me and got a car much before I did so I often had to ride home with him. I'm sure there were times where we would go a week without saying a word to each other in the car when he drove me home every day. Also, I noticed that the wrestling team started talking down to me, wouldn't take anything I said seriously, and constantly made fun of me. I have pretty thick skin, mind you, but day in and day out I went to practice and I felt like I shouldn't be on the team and that I was a laughingstock for my teammates, including Z. At first I shrugged it off but then it really started to get under my skin, and then I plunged into a deep depression shortly afterwards. I also hadn't made any real friends in high school at this point, which heavily precipitated this. Throughout this whole time Z still talked down to me and I'm pretty sure I heard him and my teammates making fun of me multiple times WITHIN my earshot. To this day I'm not sure if he had any connection with the wrestling team's and the neighborhood group's personality switch, but the signs seem to confirm it. The same old song and dance with the ride situation continued with him ignoring me. He also used to pick up the phone when I was in the middle of trying to talk to him with absolutely no warning. This continued all throughout high school until my wrestling career ended in February of my senior year. We part ways after graduation. A year and a half later I'm back for winter break from college and was hanging out in his backyard (I'm friends with his younger brother) and he happened to be back from college as well. We were sitting at a bonfire and he comes outside with two of his friends. I sit quietly as my friends and his younger brother talk to him and his friends. They talk for a long time and I'm thinking, \"Good God, is he not even going to at least acknowledge me after these years?\" My thoughts are interrupted when he finally exclaims, \"Holy shit, D, is that you? Come here!\" You know what he did next? He hugged me. He fucking hugged me. I could not believe what was happening.

I was nerdy, clumsy, not super attractive, not very physically gifted, and to top it all off I was socially awkward. I went to a co-ed school from K-4th grade (from about age 5-9) and I noticed that pretty much all of the girls at my school thought I was gross (to be fair I was a habitual nose picker then), but didn't have too many problems with the guys (my best friends are all from elementary school). I then got moved to an all-boys middle school that went from 5-7th grade (ages 9-12). Due to the aforementioned problems, I got picked on a lot at school and didn't make any friends through all of middle school. I also established a reputation for myself as a very clumsy individual and an easy target for insult, which came into play very heavily in high school. As an example, I remember someone once told me in middle school, \"May God shit on your soul.\" The thing about my middle school is that it was pretty much a pipeline to the high school (all boys) I went to so somewhere around 90 percent of the kids I went to middle school with ended up being my classmates in high school. In high school I decided to change at least one of aforementioned deficiencies by joining the football team and later the wrestling team. However, I became increasingly socially isolated because I knew people from middle school were talking about me to people who didn't go to school with me before, so as a result even more people learned about my reputation. When I joined the football team I was laughed off and decided to just stick with wrestling. At first, I was actually kind of close with people in my grade on the team and we bonded pretty well, but when I started practicing with the upperclassmen on the varsity team that all changed. They started making jokes about me (which when I tried to say I wasn't ok with them, they told me it was just a joke) and at that point my self-esteem was very low, so I just let them. Also at some point my coach developed a dislike of me at some point, most likely for the same reasons mentioned earlier. An example of this is that the upperclass and eventually my classmates on the wrestling team eventually started asking me really stupid questions just to see my response and laugh and call whatever I did say stupid. It didn't help that I am usually a pretty introverted person by nature, so whenever I got home I would sit and think about what happened daily. Eventually I was old enough to be a potential candidate for the varsity team, so I had to start cutting weight (for those of you who don't know, cutting weight is  a drastic loss of weight over a short period of time that keeps the person doing it at a very low body fat percentage), which resulted in me becoming more clumsy and my mental health degrading significantly. With all the stress on me at this point, my grades started to tank and I went into full-blown depression. I started considering suicide when I finally realized(thought) that no one cared about me. I thought I was only a tool for other people to build themselves up and when I ran out of usefulness, I was cast aside like trash. I thought no one would care when I died. I finally broke when I burst into tears and called my dad and told him that I wanted to jump off the roof our house to land on the pavement and break my neck. To be honest, I'm not sure what kept me from doing it. My best guess is that I've always had the will to keep going on and trying (which made my suicidal thoughts more surprising and agonizing and also was the reason I stayed on the wrestling team). However, I'm very glad I didn't do it and now have a much more stable group of friends now. Posting this has been very cathartic for me, but I'm sure I left out some details, so feel free to ask. OP, if you're considering suicide, just don't do it. There is always at least one person in the world who cares about you a little bit and even if there isn't, there is always someone who will if you keep fighting. \n\nTL;DR: A throwaway?

A lot of people think there's not a lot of story to it, but it actually has one of the saddest stories I've ever come across, especially the story of Crossbreed Priscilla. Dark Souls players will know exactly where I'm going with this. Crossbreed Priscilla is the product of a Giant(Lord/Lord's offspring) and a dragon (almost 100% confirmed to be Seath the Scaleless). For reasons that might take a while to explain, the union of a dragon and a Giant is forbidden and as a result through no fault of her own Priscilla is an outcast in society. She retreats to the Painting World of Ariamis to escape judgement and abuse but in reality the Painting World is much, much worse than the real world. However, her perception of reality is so skewed she fails to recognize this. What's also sad is that she's one of the few optional bosses in the game so you don't even have to kill her, she in fact tells you to walk right past her and go back to the real world. The choice given to the player is whether or not she should continue in her miserable existence. It ultimately comes down to whether or not the player believes that giving her death would be a kindness or not. The really sad part is that Priscilla is about 1% of the shit that's messed up in Dark Souls.\n\nTl;DR: Neon Genesis Evangelion and Dark Souls will definitely fuck your shit up if you let them.\nEDIT: Stuff.", "edited": 1385387876.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion/End of Evangelion.

Crossbreed Priscilla is the product of a Giant(Lord/Lord&amp;#39;s offspring) and a dragon (almost 100% confirmed to be Seath the Scaleless). For reasons that might take a while to explain, the union of a dragon and a Giant is forbidden and as a result through no fault of her own Priscilla is an outcast in society. She retreats to the Painting World of Ariamis to escape judgement and abuse but in reality the Painting World is much, much worse than the real world. However, her perception of reality is so skewed she fails to recognize this. What&amp;#39;s also sad is that she&amp;#39;s one of the few optional bosses in the game so you don&amp;#39;t even have to kill her, she in fact tells you to walk right past her and go back to the real world. The choice given to the player is whether or not she should continue in her miserable existence. It ultimately comes down to whether or not the player believes that giving her death would be a kindness or not. The really sad part is that Priscilla is about 1% of the shit that&amp;#39;s messed up in Dark Souls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;DR: Neon Genesis Evangelion and Dark Souls will definitely fuck your shit up if you let them.\nEDIT: Stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1rex33", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1rex33/potential_spoilers_what_video_gamemovietv_show/cdmkhg0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1rex33/potential_spoilers_what_video_gamemovietv_show/", "name": "t1_cdmkhg0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1385386995.0, "created_utc": 1385386995.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1rex33/potential_spoilers_what_video_gamemovietv_show/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What is the most noteworthy thing an ancestor of yours has done?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "CaptainWatermelons", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cdgj3x1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Dominuscinis", "num_comments": 14734, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1qtm2h", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_dk5qm", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Maybe not as cool as some other people's here but my Italian great grandfather (a little fuzzy on the details) fought in WW1 and got captured by the Germans.
