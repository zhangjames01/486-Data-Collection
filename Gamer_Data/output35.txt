I mean sure, no one likes losing, but when I lose to a Negative deck, a lot of times I\u2019m like \u201cLol okay, that was pretty nutz.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ma211", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/MarvelSnap/comments/11ma211/next_season_will_feature_hit_monkey_as_the_season/jbiik11/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/11ma211/next_season_will_feature_hit_monkey_as_the_season/", "name": "t1_jbiik11", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MarvelSnap", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678348229.0, "created_utc": 1678348229.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/opu4epk2tmma1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qo4s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[Wojnarowski] According to the Pierce (Wash.)
