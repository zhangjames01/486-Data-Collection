So he claimed:\n\n&gt;The appointment of magistrates by lot is thought to be democratic, and the election of them oligarchic.\n\nAnd the reason why elections are oligarchic is obvious to modern people.

No ancient Athenian would use lottery to choose their leaders either. Sortition was used solely for construction of assemblies and committees. So you're attacking a straw man here. Sortition's legitimacy comes only through collective action.  Analogously no scientist would ever base a decision on a single sample rather than a properly sized scientific sample. \n\nMoreover a funny irony with electoral legitimacy, according to opinion polls Chinese citizens find their unelected government *more legitimate* compared to citizens of the liberal West's elected government. It is clear that most of humanity doesn't buy into the argument that elections are the only path to legitimacy. \n\n&gt; They have no hand in the process.\n\nNormal people would have a hand in the process - a small probability that they will be directly involved in the process. Over a lifetime, this small probability could be quite large, especially in a fully formed sortition government where sortition assemblies are needed for local, state, and federal governments.\n\nCompare with voting: With every vote, each voter has a tiny, insignificant probability they would provide the pivotal vote. For every other time they vote, their vote has no impact on the final outcome.

Sortition gives the public access to the legislative process, the agenda setting process, the candidate selection process . In liberal elected systems, these parts of governance are closed off to the average citizen and dominated by the elite few. \n\n&gt;Leonardo Bruni pointed out sortition systems end up creating a lack of accountability in leaders because of the randomness in their appointment.\n\nBecause the proposed system isn't appointing officers, this criticism is irrelevant. When sortition committees are used as a hiring system, they provide accountability through their ability to hire and fire officers, by evaluating performance year by year. \n\n\n&gt;You know who commonly advocate for sortition? Anarcho-capitalists. See Terry Hulsey for his take on it.\n\nSounds like a contradiction to me. Anarcho-capitalists want so-called \"stateless\" privatized states.

Every election and referendum is a gamble of whether you&amp;#39;re wasting your time or not. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of expected probability of impacting the final outcome of any proposal, sortition increases the power of the public rather than diminishing it. Sortition gives the public access to the legislative process, the agenda setting process, the candidate selection process . In liberal elected systems, these parts of governance are closed off to the average citizen and dominated by the elite few. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leonardo Bruni pointed out sortition systems end up creating a lack of accountability in leaders because of the randomness in their appointment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the proposed system isn&amp;#39;t appointing officers, this criticism is irrelevant. When sortition committees are used as a hiring system, they provide accountability through their ability to hire and fire officers, by evaluating performance year by year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You know who commonly advocate for sortition? Anarcho-capitalists. See Terry Hulsey for his take on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a contradiction to me. Anarcho-capitalists want so-called &amp;quot;stateless&amp;quot; privatized states. Demanding a sortition government would contradict statelessness. Yet even if one ancapitalist out of a thousand support sortition, a broken clock is occasionally right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11pmyp6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/IronFrontUSA/comments/11pmyp6/opinions_on_sortition/jcj3hro/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IronFrontUSA/comments/11pmyp6/opinions_on_sortition/", "name": "t1_jcj3hro", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IronFrontUSA", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679028971.0, "created_utc": 1679028971.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IronFrontUSA/comments/11pmyp6/opinions_on_sortition/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_jf527", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Opinions on Sortition", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "IronFrontUSA", "link_author": "Capn_Zelnick", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jciwezl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "subheight640", "num_comments": 20, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jciul61", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3mz07", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Chance has nothing to do with lottery systems, ironically.
