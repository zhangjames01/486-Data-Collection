Ledgers are the first known use of writing. \n\nThe value (But not the USD price) of Bitcoin is backed by the energy investment of the miners validating transactions - the proof of work. By validating blocks, they prevent fraud, and in doing so, add value. Their electricity use is tokenized into newly minted Bitcoin with each block. Those blocks can then contain information, which is itself valuable. For example, DeOS is an distributed operating system under development which is entirely stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, including all of your user data (Accessible only to you), and can be run by anyone with internet access (It's still in development, so access is limited, but makes everything built so far on Ethereum look stone-age tools by comparison).\n\nBitcoin fees haven't truly gone up much in the past years from a Bitoiner's perspective. They're computed relative to network use, and are (And have always been) priced in bitcoin. The big reason for \"higher fees\" is that the people talking about them are seeing that value of the dollar relative to bitcoin has dropped so much that, once changed to USD, you're paying more dollars. That seems more like a reason to complain to the Fed for the dollar collapsing.\n\nIf you need lower fees and a instant transactions, the [Bitcoin lightning network](https://lightning.network/) was just released earlier this week. It moves transactions to a second chain, then commits a hash of the 2nd chain to the main chain periodically. The trade-off is that you'll get slightly reduced transactional security.\n\nI've done enough programming on Bitcoin to say what many others are unaware of; there's nothing that you can code on the Ethereum network that cannot also be built on Bitcoin. The tech isn't outdated. It's just built from a different frame of mind. Bitcoin prioritizes stability, while Ethereum focuses on raw expressive power. Ethereum makes the whole process of coding up a DApp simpler by providing easier programming languages for the use cases of a DApp, but unfortunately, these languages have been prone to allowing you to easily introduce dangerous code issues.\n\nI'll admit that the current price volatility does cause issues with using Bitcoin to pay for small items. However, merchants being paid for larger items are generally less adverse to this risk, as they are more likely to hold for a higher USD value.
