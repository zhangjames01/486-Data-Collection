Unfortunately, we live in a time in which marijuana is no longer a \"safe\" drug, a byproduct stemming from the decontrol and deregulation of the substance.

But the disconcerting truth is that when it comes down to it, you don't really know for certain that you are only smoking marijuana. Sure, its a plant: it's dry, sticky, leafy with an abundance of buds, caked in trichomes. But even if it fits that description, how can you be certain that it is simply marijuana?

Lets just say that, while completely blown out of proportion, South Park's \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\" episode wasn't too far off the mark. And there is a reason Karl from Workaholics (the drug dealer if you are unfamiliar) has one lazy eye. My advice to you, and anyone else in a similar situation, is to abstain for now, for your body's sake. If you do want to keep smoking, try to find a way to get your herb directly from the source, and I'm not talking dispensaries (I am in no way suggesting you should start growing your own, there is enough of that on these boards it seems).

If you have ever smoked the Blue Cheese strain, that is the scent it closely resembles to me, except now I find it on indicas and sativas alike. By contrast, I have friends who still can get \"pure\" stuff that doesn't smell like anything other than plain ganj, which is a welcome scent compared to the sickening alternative. I have heard, among other things, that these days some herb gets sprayed with who knows what, purely to add weight to the batch.
