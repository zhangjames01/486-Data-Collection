I had an infuriating conversation with a good friend of mine (not an engineer) who claimed that the Dam operators aught to lose their jobs because they opened the flood-gates and thus Brisbane homes were inundated. His argument hinged on the idea that the Dam operators should have known flooding was imminent months in advance due to the high weather index, and released the Wyvenhoe water reserves accordingly such that the Dam was near empty before all the rain landed in the upper catchments. \n\nTo me that sounds like bullshit. Try telling an engineer specialising in catchment hydrology to release drinking water reserves from the dam on the prediction of more rainfall, shortly after we've just come out of 10 years of drought. No way would they do that. In fact only a few months ago the Opposition was telling them specifically *not* to release any more water. And no way could they have known the magnitude of rainfall that was going to hit that catchment. \n\nWyvenhoe serves two purposes: To retain water as drinking reserves for the greater Brisbane regional area, and to mitigate flooding from the upper catchment. I can't see how Wyvenhoe didn't excel at both of these. \n\nThe dam operators' primary concern is the structural integrity of the dam wall, and rightly so. They were operating at ~100% of the design drinking water level (the optimal amount) when the brunt of the rainfall that caused the flood hit, and in the next week the amount of water hitting Wyvenhoe almost doubled. Even if the structural capacity of the dam means it can handle up to ~300% of the design water level, you don't really want to be pushing the upper threshold of what that wall can handle because if it fails, Brisbane would have been completely fucked.\n\nSo accordingly, the operators opened up the gates to release water from the dam in an attempt to relieve the amount of stress being inflicted upon it by the huge backup of water. What people don't seem to understand is that even with all the gates open, this still represents a situation in which a significant amount of flow is being mitigated - ie not reaching Brisbane.\nThe engineers came out the day after the peak and said that even with all the gates open they came very close to an 'uncontrolled release', which means that water almost spilled out from somewhere it shouldn't have. This wouldn't *necessarily* lead to the dam wall collapsing, but it definitely increases the risk of failure by an uncomfortable amount.\n\nThat being said, in the case of the Wyvenhoe guys, I honestly think this whole thing is just a bunch of people without any expertise hunting for witches. They want someone to blame, a head on a pike. Sometimes there just isn't anyone to blame. But fair enough, let there be an enquiry and hopefully we might learn something about how to better react next time.\n\nIn regards BCC allowing developers to build in flood plains, then yes I can tell you that is a more legitimate concern. For smaller local catchments, engineers do their own catchment hydrology and flood investigations, so if any developments are inundated in a storm that doesn't meet the design standards by local catchment flooding then the blame falls on the guys who modelled it incorrectly. However when it comes to the development application phase of any project in proximity to the river, planners and engineers rely on Council's data from large-scale flood investigation reports that consider the whole of the Brisbane river catchment. BCC commissions these reports, which are usually conducted by large-scale engineering firms and updated periodically. In this flood just gone, we've seen river levels exceeding the highest Defined Flood Level by over a metre in some places. This a huge worry if the data *everywhere* is out by that much, because this means that a lot of development undertaken in the past decade is smack-bang within areas subject to compromise every time a flood event hits, and thus Council has to take some serious blame. \n\nSo yeah, there's some major engineering firms (including some internationals) who are currently being commissioned to reassess both the dam operation and the Brisbane River catchment flooding situation by the end of February.

The standards specifically addressing flood immunity were revised in 2002 and then again in 2008 in the BCC Subdivision &amp;amp; Development Guidelines. They are appropriately strict now. Before that it was a bit of a wild west, developers had a lot less red tape to get through in relation to flood immunity and it shows with these floods.

Q50 means \"1 in 50 year ARI event. Its worth noting these \"smaller\" catchments can be anywhere from half a hectare to 150 hectares in size, and can generate a shit-ton of water in a very short amount of time. If a residential house is within an identified overland flowpath, it is subject to a BONSW (Building Over/Near Stormwater Infrastructure) application, which usually means being built on raised supports with anywhere from 600mm to 2.5m clearance, depending on the situation. For areas subject to river flooding (all the houses that are currently inundated) the standard is at the Q100 level or the highest DFL - the '74 flood. I won't get into non-residential restrictions but they exist too.\n\nNow, the reason you're seeing so many houses inundated is because Council have been implementing these restrictions only over the past 9-10 years. Flood immunity became an issue after 1974, but it wasn't really until 2002 and then 2008 that the BCC Subdivision &amp; Development Guidelines really started to crack down on developers in regards to flood immunity. \n\nThe other thing is, BCC can't force people who had already built houses below the flood level to instantly comply with this new law. Accordingly, as developers buy up land and try to build, Council makes them either raise the floors to an acceptable standard or provide evidence to support a case of \"no worsening\". This allows small houses to be rebuilt at the same level so long as they don't increase expected usage, but restrict developers from buying small low-lying houses and building huge multi-units below the flood level (as this will increase the expected usage). \n\nI can tell you from experience that meeting these restrictions is a real challenge, and developers HATE it because it costs them a lot of money to comply with. But as engineers we understand the standards exist for a reason, and after this week just gone I'm pretty sure that everyone else would have a better idea of that too.\n\nThe other thing is, if anyone has ever worked in construction they will know that a lot of dodgy work goes on. If BCC don't speak up about the potential for flooding in the development application phase of a project, it will usually go unacknowledged the developers and planners too. I've even seen cases where the developers are aware of the potential problem but if Council haven't say anything, they will ignore it to save costs, and sell up quick as possible to clear their hands of it. This doesn't occur too often, but it does happen.\n\nIf anyone wants more info, check out the BCC website where you can download the 2008 Subdivision &amp; Development Guidelines and read the codes and regulations for yourself.\n\ntl;dr - No, Brisbane hasn't \"forgotten\" how to build for the wet.
