Spotting is probably the biggest, but understanding other things like HEAT/AP/APCR pen drop off, normalization, and auto bounces can also help you pick the right shell and shoot it at the right part of a tank. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, using the E-100 as my example, if I&amp;#39;m fighting someone shooting HEAT, I&amp;#39;ll take an extreme angle with my chassis (like 45\u00b0) because the skirts and tracks eat HEAT for breakfast and that huge angle protects my lower glacis. I only do that because I know the difference between HEAT and AP. If I&amp;#39;m fighting an E-100 shooting AP, I&amp;#39;d never take such a steep angle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_118e5ea", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WorldofTanks/comments/118e5ea/learn_the_spotting_mechanics_in_world_of_tanks_in/j9k8b9l/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldofTanks/comments/118e5ea/learn_the_spotting_mechanics_in_world_of_tanks_in/", "name": "t1_j9k8b9l", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WorldofTanks", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677083003.0, "created_utc": 1677083003.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://v.redd.it/6on8wlqkllja1"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s113", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Learn the spotting mechanics in World of Tanks in less than 60 seconds!", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "WorldofTanks", "link_author": "SpikeyArmadillo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j9k2rwv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ZXFT", "num_comments": 53, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j9jxslq", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_b39kc", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "[Apologies for the shit drawing since I'm on my phone.](https://i.imgur.com/dqx2qMh.png)\n\nUse your imagination that the vertical line is a building and there's debris cover to the (shooter's) right: here you get the gun mantlet, and therefore spotting, around the corner without needing to expose your cupola or too much of your tank. \n\nIt's not something you can use everywhere all the time, but situationally it'll let you peek and see enemies faster than if you were aimed straight forward at the shooter.\n\nAmerican gun mantlets are great at eating HE, HESH, and HEAT.
