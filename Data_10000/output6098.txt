I am no longer with this person:\n\n&gt;I am a seasoned traveler. I have been on vacations many time with my parents who are so nice to be taking me so often. I know how to do things, what to do and when to do so.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cut to mid February my SO's parents are taking me on a vacation. I pack and go to their house the night before. Immediately they say \"why do you have so many bags!?\" I explained, \"I have my checked bag, my carry on bag, my purse and the last one is to leave here with my pj's and clean clothes for when we get back.\" Conversation happens about how my carry on bag is WAY too big. I have used this bag as have all of my family members (mom, dad and sister) zero issues ever. They measure it, okay fine, double check. Whatever. They call me up with a concerned sounding tone and say \"Your bag is far too big. I just measured. See here these are the measurements\" I look at the page. It looks like this:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Carry on Baggage  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Bag: XYZ measurements  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Personal Item: XYZ measurements  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He is looking at the \"Personal Item (aka purse, camera bag, backpack, etc) So I say that its fine and here is why and its even under by half an inch. Fine. I'm right. We move on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are scheduled to fly out at 6ish the next day so at about 5:30 I ask about web check in to reserve our seats. \"No we don't need to do that. They place us when we get to the airport.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: No they don't. You need web check in. Also you get to pick your seats. You can put all 5 of us together.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: Nope.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Ok fine.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Next morning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We go to the airport and go to check into the airport and check our bags.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: We need to go to the kiosk to get the tags.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: Nope. They do that. We just get in line.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me (inner thoughts): Is that why every person in that line has tags on their bags?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So we get in line. After about a minute if waiting we are approached by an employee who asks for our bag tags and she'll put them on for us.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: We don't have them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her: Okay. See the kiosks over there? You need to check in at them first.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: ... !!! ...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cut to the front of the line when we get rid of our checked baggage. Okay so 3 of you are on the flight and 2 of you are on standby (3 being SO's mom dad and sister 2 on standby being my SO and I).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: WTF *rage, rage, rage* Why not?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Employee: Did you do web check in 24 hours before your flight to confirm your seats?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me (inner monologue FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them: ... no...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Her: That's why.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So now I'm not technically on the flight. Had they listened to me I would have been. Sister gives literally zero fucks and is being obnoxious as per usual so that made it much worse. They bought me 1 beer for the stress. That's it. 1 beer. I'm not even a fan of beer but I was only allotted $4 for a drink. Luckily we all got on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To make it worse still, I didn't have a great time on vacation anyway but that's a whole other story.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**EDIT:** Shit I just realized how long this is.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**TL;DR I was right every step of the way and y'all motherfuckers need to listen to me!!!**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**EDIT2:** So since a few people have now asked about the vacation here goes. Obviously it didn't start well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We went to Cayo Santa Maria, Cuba. Stayed at Melia Las Dunas resort (10/10 would recommend) His parents payed for most of it. SO paid $250 each for his and my plane tickets and there is more to come  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Like I said its his family, Mom(46), Dad(46), Sister(18), Him(20), and I(21).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My SO and I had a room and the rest of the family was in another room across the resort (YUSSS) Mom says \"We are going to upgrade our room to be closer\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Why? It's no big deal. We can walk. Don't worry about it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They don't move rooms (YUSSS)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One night Sister who like I said is 18 goddamn years old. Gets drunk and starts hitting on a 25 ish yo guy. In front of the whole family. While she has a bf (of 1 month who she was obsessed with spending 2.10 pesos/minute to call 3+ times a day). Not a nice thing to do in the first place. For the rest of the trip she was obsessed with finding him and his friends. After dinner one night, she was waiting up until 11 to call her bf and my SO and I were told by their parents to basically babysit her. Fine, no problem at all. Until she sees Mike (the guy she was hitting on) go in the general direction of a snack bar. Then she demands we go down there to eat. My SO and I both know the real reason and he says \"You're waiting to call what's-his-name in the lobby here, why don't we wait in the lobby to do so. (Picture the most immature, attitude filled teenage girl voice here) \"Fine. Whatever.\" So my SO tells her to cut the attitude and she starts screaming \"I don't fucking have a fucking attitude. I fucking didn't until you fucking said something\" Then stormed off. My SO caught up with her and grabbed her arm to again scold her since the parents were in bed already. She flipped her shit and was literally throwing a temper tantrum swearing at both of us and freaking out for no reason. I said I'm not dealing with it and went back to the room. Shortly thereafter my SO came in and said her sent her back to her room then called to check if she was there which she was. The next morning he got an apology, I didn't and I didn't know until well after we came home.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Other than that, we were woken up every morning by a phone call from his mom saying that we need to get up and go for breakfast at about 7-8am. I'm a VERY picky eater and I had zero say whatsoever in where we ate and Mom, Dad, and Sister insisted on seafood (which I hate and can't stand the smell of) every day, every meal. When I suggested something else my SO would say yeah why don't we try it. The rest of the fam. Nope we want this and we won't go anywhere else.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Us: Ok well we will go to A and you can go to B then we can meet at C.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Them; Nope. Were eating together.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I almost starved the whole time I was there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There was an option when we arrived to upgrade to VIP for the plane ride back for 25 pesos. My SO and I paid for our own when it wasn't our choice and online check in would have avoided the whole thing. There is a 25 peso tax to leave the country. My SO and I paid for our own. After my SO said \"My parents will pay for 1 excursion but after that we pay for our own\" which I 100% understand and agree with. We all decided we wanted to go on a Catamaran for 100 pesos each. My SO and I paid for our own. All of these things we paid for ourselves, his parents paid for the sisters by the way.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am obsessed with sun and being warm so I was excited to spend a week in it. We went to the pool/beach and Dad and SO went and played in the water or whatever because they don't like just sitting there which is fine. The three girls laid out... in the shade... I said oh why don't we get one of the free umbrellas and you guys can have shade and I can have sun. NO! We are going to lay under this shelter. FUCK FINE.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I ended up telling my SO, I'm getting sick of being told what to do. It's my vacation too and I'm not having much fun as of yet.
