The US was doing everything it could to fuck with socialised economies like the Soviets and India, even if that meant allying themselves to genocidal dictators or radical islamists. Look at the outcomes of Iran and Afghanistan which were both relatively progressive and now total religious fascist shitholes after US involvement.\n\nAnyway, Russia stood firm and protected India from US meddling and indirect aggression. An absolutely wild situation where the US and India, both major democracies, ended up allied to Pakistan and the Soviets respectively. And that's down to US behaviour at that period.\n\nSure since then the US has been warm to India. But India doesn't forget that shit and won't trust the US. If anything, it owes Russia a favour for the protection and 1960s peace process that Russia brought about. So you can't really blame them for sticking with their ally and getting cheaper energy to boot.\n\nDo you think Ukraine gives a flying fuck about all the warring issues in the subcontinent between Pakistan, India or China etc? Why would India have to give a shit about what's going on in Europe. As soon as the conflict started, Indian students in Ukraine were being attacked and abused whilst trying to get to safety. And yet apparently India needs to take Ukraine's position on this situation instead of her historical ally. For some reason.\n\nIt's actually demented how little Americans seem to know about how much fuckery their country got up to in living memory and why countries don't just do their bidding.

Fucking learn some shit people.", "edited": 1677112122.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Errr yeah, Russia and India have historically been allies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much shite about Modi worshipping etc in this thread and all sorts of nonsense. But ultimately there are only 2 things that ACTUALLY matter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(1) India wants access to cheap energy&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(2) Historical allegiance between Russia and India&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if you want to discuss (2), a major reason for this is US support for Pakistan in ~1970 with regard to modern day Bangladesh. The US was doing everything it could to fuck with socialised economies like the Soviets and India, even if that meant allying themselves to genocidal dictators or radical islamists. Look at the outcomes of Iran and Afghanistan which were both relatively progressive and now total religious fascist shitholes after US involvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Russia stood firm and protected India from US meddling and indirect aggression. An absolutely wild situation where the US and India, both major democracies, ended up allied to Pakistan and the Soviets respectively. And that&amp;#39;s down to US behaviour at that period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure since then the US has been warm to India. But India doesn&amp;#39;t forget that shit and won&amp;#39;t trust the US. If anything, it owes Russia a favour for the protection and 1960s peace process that Russia brought about. So you can&amp;#39;t really blame them for sticking with their ally and getting cheaper energy to boot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think Ukraine gives a flying fuck about all the warring issues in the subcontinent between Pakistan, India or China etc? Why would India have to give a shit about what&amp;#39;s going on in Europe. As soon as the conflict started, Indian students in Ukraine were being attacked and abused whilst trying to get to safety. And yet apparently India needs to take Ukraine&amp;#39;s position on this situation instead of her historical ally. For some reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually demented how little Americans seem to know about how much fuckery their country got up to in living memory and why countries don&amp;#39;t just do their bidding. It must be so confusing why so many nations seem to dislike the US when they can only see themselves as the good guys.
