But yeah definitely don't stress about providing an overly huge amount of variety. There are a lot of reasons to provide kids with variety in food, namely nutrition and then getting their palates accustomed to different foods. But that doesn't mean you need to be making a world-class creative gourmet meal for every meal. My daughter is older (3) and also is a \"sensory seeker\" who really, really loves food, but even she is totally fine with my above formula for breakfast and lunch, and then for dinner I get more creative. But having a set-in-stone formula for two meals a day cuts down on stress so much.\n\nAnother idea: prep snacks in advance and put them in tiny containers like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z3VBCY/). It can be something super homemade if you want...sometimes I make homemade dried fruit and homemade healthy crackers and put those in there. But portioning out individual snack-size servings of refrigerated and shelf-stable commercial snacks is great too because then you can just grab one whenever you need.
