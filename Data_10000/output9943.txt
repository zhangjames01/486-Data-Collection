We went to the hospital where they diagnosed her with a very short cervix and placenta previa. All the doctors agreed to place a cervical cerclage to ensure the cervix would not shorten further.\n\nThe procedure went very well, but when my wife tried to stand up 2 hours after the procedure there was a large gush of fluid. We were admitted right away as we tried to grasp what everything that was going on. About 2 hours after that, my wife experienced another large gush. At this point the doctors talked to us about the sad reality that our baby would most likely not survive. Since this happened during the night, we had to wait for an ultrasound in the morning. I wont bore you with the details of that never ending night; how we struggled to pick a name, or the difficult phone calls we had to make.\n\nIn the morning, the ultrasound showed that there was a small pocket of fluid around the baby's face. The \"oncall\" doctor wanted to terminate the pregnancy (actually had the room prepped to do the procedure when we returned from ultrasound). Luckily our OB was not ready to give up and reversed the doctors order on the chart. To say this caused a bit of a fight would be an understatement.\n\nA few days later we were sent home with the order of complete bed rest. \nSomehow we made it through 5 months...and just last week we welcomed our daughter kicking and screaming into the world.
