In the original game, in every circumstance  where he would grab a pikmin to use for an attack (which just so happens to be only one move in this case - throwing -, but I feel that quantity isn't important for this point), he would instead use his own fists if he was without pikmin, not just flail around helplessly like he does in Smash.

Personally, I think he is one of the worst represented characters in the Smash universe, to the point where I would say he probably belongs in one of the bottom two areas of your tier list. To elaborate (**TL;DR below**):\n\n* Rock Pikmin are completely absent and Purples have Rock's properties (knockback only, no latching) instead of their own (latching, homing, and stunning);\n\n* White Pikmin deal increased damage, but they do not have this mechanic in Pikmin. Their poisonous death mechanics and ability to uproot treasure could somehow translate better, in my opinion;\n\n* Pink Pikmin (at the time of release, so discounting Hey Pikmin! (if it's even canon, though I'm not sure)) would not carry a conscious Olimar, if I recall correctly (please correct me if I'm wrong, however). Pikmin have been shown to instinctively carry Olimar as if he were prey when he is unconscious, but they have the sense to not pick him up if he's awake;\n\n* His Up-Bs have never been canonical recoveries, despite having several good options from his own franchise (eg. his cockpit could recover him, or a geyser could launch him, or a bomb rock could explode and knock him upwards, or a snitchbug could carry him away);\n\n* Flowers on pikmin heads *should* change their damage/health/speed, yet the feature is simply aesthetic;\n\n* Pikmin Throw preserves none of the nuance of controlled aiming (a case where the implementation *feels* misrepresentative of the franchise, as Olimar is very precise with his aim in order to reduce casualties, as is supported by his regret when pikmin die due to his mistakes);\n\n* All of his smashes/aerials feel completely misrepresentative of Olimar's relationship with the pikmin. They are not American football players or personal baseball bats, yet that's exactly how they behave.

I&amp;#39;m honestly not sure if I think the proposed system is perfect, but it initially feels like a big improvement for the people it&amp;#39;s trying to help, and this could help save a lot of lost or otherwise wasted lives in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_6ozyd3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/6ozyd3/tories_promote_the_right_to_choose_your_own_sex/dklo3iz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6ozyd3/tories_promote_the_right_to_choose_your_own_sex/", "name": "t1_dklo3iz", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ukpolitics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1500804639.0, "created_utc": 1500804639.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/tories-promote-right-to-choose-your-own-sex-sk2q2vwc0"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhek", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[SPOILERS] MEGATHREAD: The 13th Doctor is....", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "doctorwho", "link_author": "pcjonathan", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dkfjojf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SoHughman", "num_comments": 19407, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dkf6hnf", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_g6as2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Certainly, showrunners select candidates for effect based on where they\u2019re taking a production, but I think the tidbits we\u2019ve heard about the auditioning process this time around establishes some ideological positions of the showrunner that, I hope we can agree, are quite divisive.\n\nSome people expected the change of canon to reflect an abandonment of gender-/sex-based stereotypes (if there were many/any to begin with), whereas others expected the change to enable the showrunners to capitalise on more quantitatively equal representation.

For example, the whole process from diagnosis to medicinal/surgical treatment is plagued with waiting lists. I know in the current NHS climate this isn't too unusual, but for a group with such a high suicide rate they shouldn't be waiting multiple years before they can receive basic transitional treatment (eg. Hormones), which is practically essential for alleviating gender dysphoria. It could be argued that, given the prevalence of mental illness among transfolk, and that some people undergo treatment and then change their mind when it's too late, that long waiting times are useful for ensuring that trans people really are trans, but there are probably other ways to ensure this, such as more intensive therapy or more liberal administration of hormone blockers (i.e. Drugs that effectively balance testosterone and estrogen very low, which can temporarily \"pause\" puberty so that future hormonal treatment can yield more desirable effects). What with puberty being a great time of distress and self realisation for trans people, these waits are not conducive to protecting their mental wellbeing or future ability to \"pass\" as their desired identity.  \n\nAnother issue is that the NHS only offers a few preset options/pathways for trans people, which also denies/delays help for people who don't want the whole monty of medical involvement (which isn't too uncommon, given that medical intervention has many complications, including total loss of sexual function). Again, delays have life long consequences for the quality of life of trans people. \n\nSurgery is also a complicated issue, as some surgeries that are arguably essential so as to not alienate certain trans individuals (eg. Breast implants, facial surgery) are not available on the NHS, whereas others are. It's good that some surgeries are covered, but, for the many that can't afford such surgeries, it can feel like being left incomplete, which, aside from being shit on a very everyday level, also does not lend itself to helping trans people \"pass\" as their desired identity. \n\nThen,  there are non-binary (i.e. Non-male, non-female) people, who, again, are mishandled by the NHS's one-size-fits-all systems, and also aren't legally recognised as non-binary. It may seem insignificant or a bit snowflake-y to a lot of people, but simply imagine how absurd it would be if a job application didn't allow you to tick your actual gender/religion/race/county, but every other option was there, forcing you to pick something that you weren't. It's invalidating, and a simple third option would be enough for the vast majority of people. \n\nLastly, the lack of trans awareness/education leads to a lot of misunderstanding, late cases of self discovery (again, usually really shit),  and sometimes  misdiagnoses. Not to suggest that gender studies should be a mandatory subject, but some kind of gentle integration would go a long way for everybody. \n\nI don't mean to suggest that the problems aren't slowly being acknowledged and addressed, but they're still somewhat prevalent today as issues that trans people face, on top of the general crapness that gender dysphoria entails.

What with puberty being a great time of distress and self realisation for trans people, these waits are not conducive to protecting their mental wellbeing or future ability to &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; as their desired identity.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that the NHS only offers a few preset options/pathways for trans people, which also denies/delays help for people who don&amp;#39;t want the whole monty of medical involvement (which isn&amp;#39;t too uncommon, given that medical intervention has many complications, including total loss of sexual function). Again, delays have life long consequences for the quality of life of trans people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Surgery is also a complicated issue, as some surgeries that are arguably essential so as to not alienate certain trans individuals (eg. Breast implants, facial surgery) are not available on the NHS, whereas others are. It&amp;#39;s good that some surgeries are covered, but, for the many that can&amp;#39;t afford such surgeries, it can feel like being left incomplete, which, aside from being shit on a very everyday level, also does not lend itself to helping trans people &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; as their desired identity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then,  there are non-binary (i.e. Non-male, non-female) people, who, again, are mishandled by the NHS&amp;#39;s one-size-fits-all systems, and also aren&amp;#39;t legally recognised as non-binary. It may seem insignificant or a bit snowflake-y to a lot of people, but simply imagine how absurd it would be if a job application didn&amp;#39;t allow you to tick your actual gender/religion/race/county, but every other option was there, forcing you to pick something that you weren&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s invalidating, and a simple third option would be enough for the vast majority of people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the lack of trans awareness/education leads to a lot of misunderstanding, late cases of self discovery (again, usually really shit),  and sometimes  misdiagnoses. Not to suggest that gender studies should be a mandatory subject, but some kind of gentle integration would go a long way for everybody. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mean to suggest that the problems aren&amp;#39;t slowly being acknowledged and addressed, but they&amp;#39;re still somewhat prevalent today as issues that trans people face, on top of the general crapness that gender dysphoria entails. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_6jsr30", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/6jsr30/almost_half_of_trans_pupils_in_uk_have_attempted/djgrlhp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6jsr30/almost_half_of_trans_pupils_in_uk_have_attempted/", "name": "t1_djgrlhp", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ukpolitics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1498575149.0, "created_utc": 1498575149.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jun/27/half-of-trans-pupils-in-the-uk-tried-to-take-their-own-lives-survey-finds"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What is a word people constantly misuse?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "LorenzEKearns", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "df4uhcg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SoHughman", "num_comments": 12189, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_609dl5", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g6as2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "**Excretion =/= Pooping/Poop**\n\nExcretion = Pissing/Sweating/Breathing out CO2\n\nPooping = Egestion\n\nPoop = Excrement\n\n---\n\nIt's easy to see why the confusion is made, and it's colloquially understood regardless, but it drives me up the wall!
