I witnessed one of my siblings abuse the living shit out of her kids as their homeschool teacher. They did the whole &amp;quot;awana&amp;quot; thing, backyard bible club shite, and acted like everyone &lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt; was crazy. She beat them when she got mad at ME, often in front of me while glaring directly at me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;both her kids barely speak to her now, and are atheists. They&amp;#39;re both doing pretty well for themselves, considering the hell they were given for no reason. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope YOU are doing well now, friend. it really does get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ocwnh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/excatholic/comments/11ocwnh/thoughts_on_private_schools_homeschooling/jbti4xr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/excatholic/comments/11ocwnh/thoughts_on_private_schools_homeschooling/", "name": "t1_jbti4xr", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/excatholic", "author_flair_text": "Recovering Catholic, Apatheist", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678551679.0, "created_utc": 1678551679.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/excatholic/comments/11ocwnh/thoughts_on_private_schools_homeschooling/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sdlb", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Thoughts on Private Schools / Homeschooling?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "excatholic", "link_author": "jollygoodtoast", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbthgh3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jimjoebob", "num_comments": 35, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbt1h1x", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4fyoe", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "a woman I know sent her kid to the first kind of catholic school, and they were ok (according to the kid and her).
