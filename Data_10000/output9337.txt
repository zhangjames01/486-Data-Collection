You can teach this. Just like any other subject, you break it down into single tasks that can be learned independently. You provide scaffolding while they are learning the task. Then you help them combine the tasks. I explain in more detail below but here's the overview:\n\nTo start it helps to have a bike that allows the wheels to spin without the pedals moving. The ones I got my kids freewheeled when not pedaling, and engaged brakes when backpedaling. And of course, find a place with some room and minimal traffic. Cul-de-sac's work great.\n\n1. Explain: \"A bicycle will balance itself if it is going fast enough. When you are still you will fall, but if you are moving, the bike will balance and you only need to balance your body on it.\"\n2. With the kid on the bike, hold the back of the seat. You should be strong enough to keep them balanced with your hand on their seat.\n3. Push them forward, keeping your hand on the bike. Tell them not to pedal, just focus on how it feels. \"I don't want you to pedal yet. Try to balance.\" Then encourage and give feedback: \"Stay up straight! Don't lean over! That's good!\", etc. In this step you should be gradually relaxing your hold on the bike as they start to get a feel for the balance. The idea is to let them feel how their body weight affects the balance without letting them fall over. So let them start to fall but catch them so they can feel what it's like to balance.\n4. Once they've gotten a feel for the balance, repeat the exercise, but briefly remove your hand from the seat so they are balancing on their own. Again, encourage and give feedback. As they gain confidence let them go a full second without your hand, then a few seconds, etc. Make sure you keep up with the bike so you can catch them if they lose balance. Also remember at this point that they are still not pedaling. You are push-starting them and letting them coast.\n5. Once they are able to coast from a push-start and balance without your assistance, teach them how to operate the brakes. Don't combine coasting and braking yet, go back to you holding the bike. Explain the braking mechanism, then push them forward and tell them to brake to a stop. Once they've repeated this enough for it to become easy, go back through the process of steps 2-4, but now they come to a stop by braking, not by you stopping them. Be prepared to stop them if they aren't braking in time. At each step you want them to feel comfortable (almost bored) before you let them move on to the next.\n6. Now we introduce pedaling. But we're going to use the same framework of steps 2-4. Explain how the pedals work. Then start back with you pushing them and your hand providing balance. While you're providing balance, get them pedaling. They should be pedaling enough that they are providing some forward drive. Remind them to brake before they run out of room. Work your way back up: relaxing your hand, briefly removing it, letting them go unassisted. We're integrating this new skill, pedaling, with what they've learned so far.\n7. Now they are ready for turning. Just like everything else, we start back with step 2: your hand on the seat. Push them through a turn so they know how it feels. I know we just learned pedaling, but have them stop pedaling for now. We're going to go back through the process. Once they are taking turns from a push-start without needing your hand for balance, let them add back in pedaling as they come through the turn.\n8. Finally we're ready to teach them to start on their own. Show them the way to position the pedals. If they can't reach, show them how to use a curb to reach. Explain that they are pushing off from the ground, pushing down on the pedal, and swinging their leg onto the bike. Hold the bike and let them practice this with you providing balance. Don't mix in any of the other stuff, just have them start and mount the bike. Once they have that down, let them start, travel in a straight line, and brake to a stop. Once they've got that add curves back in. Then work with them for variations on the start: what if they're on a slight incline, etc.\n\nBy this point they're probably bored of you teaching and ready to just ride. They'll figure things out from here. It would be a good idea to watch and help them identify mistakes before they have a big wipe-out. Things to look out for: turning too sharply (gentle turns are best!), [target fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_fixation) (look where you want to go, don't stare at something you are trying to avoid!), going too fast too soon (they need to develop the muscle memory to be able to react at speed).\n\nAlso, the above is the super-verbose, every step included version.

Real actors with make-up and prosthetics were used only for tight shots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Rygiel, Weta significantly enhanced Massive for The Two Towers. To improve the movement and look of crowd characters, they developed Grunt, the shading and rendering program designed for use with Massive. &amp;quot;Grunt allowed us to get a lot closer to the soldiers and have them hold up larger in frame,&amp;quot; says Rygiel. &amp;quot;Also, it provides better dynamics for things like cloth and hair so that they react realistically to wind flows.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This from the article is also funny:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Helm\u2019s Deep didn\u2019t capture the biggest visual effect of its time, but it probably captured more actual stuff than 99 percent of movies had before or since. The Lord of the Rings series carries its award-winning prestige because of this old-fashioned approach: Only make with computers what we can\u2019t possibly create in real life. The movies hold up well because of that approach, too.
