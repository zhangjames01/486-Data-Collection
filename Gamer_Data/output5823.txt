The tale of humanity is one of kings, and for as long as there have been stories of kings, there have been stories of their successors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate that Charming Prince is a nod to a trope, but it&amp;#39;s a solid nod that takes itself seriously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These ideas all have a solid history in literature before Disney&amp;#39;s take on them, and will survive long after Disney is gone. The only card on that list that I think is overly questionable is Enchanted Carriage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate tone over the internet is difficult to convey - I&amp;#39;m not trying to say that you are wrong to feel the way that you do. In fact, I expected to feel the way that you did when the set was announced, but when I saw and played with the cards, I changed my mind. Eldraine has become one of my favourite sets of recent years, and &lt;em&gt;to me,&lt;/em&gt; they hit the nail on the head, paying homage to the darker and more grisly side of a lot of these &amp;quot;fairy tales&amp;quot;, without becoming too dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did you know that in the original telling of Sleeping Beauty, she had a child while asleep, and the only reason she awoke is that her child sucked the splinter out of her thumb? Most of these tales were much darker than the Disney retellings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11wkf8j", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/magicTCG/comments/11wkf8j/mark_rosewater_with_magic_moving_to_a_more_modern/jcys94y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/11wkf8j/mark_rosewater_with_magic_moving_to_a_more_modern/", "name": "t1_jcys94y", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/magicTCG", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679329413.0, "created_utc": 1679329413.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/712262053601099776/with-magic-moving-to-a-more-modern-setting-at#notes"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qn5f", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Mark Rosewater: With Magic moving to a more modern setting at times how modern is too modern? \"What do you all think?\"", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 7, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "magicTCG", "link_author": "HonorBasquiat", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcyigv0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Korlus", "num_comments": 700, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcycl5l", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_75w2r", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; I care more about the \"tone\" of Magic in that I would prefer very wacky and silly flavor stuff like [[Gingerbrute]] and [[Enchanted Carriage]] to stay in Acorn territory.\n\nSee, I *loved* Throne of Eldraine as a storybook world come to life.
