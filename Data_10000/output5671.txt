Almost a year ago, I was fapping on a daily basis, when I discovered NoFap and the concept of being a Fapstronaut. I jumped on board for three main reasons: \"fapstronaut\" is a brilliant name and I wanted to be one, I was curious to see if it would really improve my life, and finally, my masturbation habits had recently taken a turn to the point where my junk would get mildly inflamed and angry afterwards, and I decided I wasn't about that life.\n\nSo I quit masturbating cold-turkey, and I stayed free of any smut-based explicit material for a good long while. To answer your questions, then, this is my first streak since joining NoFap. The first month was definitely the hardest, partially because I was out of school and stuff without much to do, but also just because the memory of the habit lingered more strongly. There would be days around weeks 2 and 3 I would lie in bed hoping I'd have a wet dream that night (spoiler, they didn't start up again for a full month after I quit, and they're generally disappointing, what with the whole mess and all). Despite my success in keeping my hand out of my pants, it certainly wasn't easy.\n\nI would attribute my success to two factors. One, the self-discipline I have developed over years of doing school and band. Willpower/self-control/self-discipline/whatever is like a mental muscle, and mine was already pretty strong going into this NoFap thing. The key was (and is) to have a solid reason or two why you're doing what you're doing. That's where the third reason (above) I hopped on NoFap came in - the (metaphorical) bad taste left in my mouth by what I was doing just before I quit helped spoil my appetite.\n\nObviously, your circumstances are different than mine, but I hope you can still find this useful. I assume you have some big, looming reason for doing NoFap. Hopefully, it isn't just \"I read porn is bad and stuff.\" I'm not here to argue that point, but I am going to say that isn't a productive way to think. Instead, identify a goal of yours - doing well in school, getting a job, becoming an eccentric polyglot who runs an everyman sleep schedule and punches bears with the extra spare time, something. Rationalize momentarily how fapping isn't going to help you achieve your goal(s), and instead identify some pursuits that will. While you're at it, come up with some unrelated hobbies that interest you (bear punching?). Chances are, you'll be able to come up with a list of things long/intense enough that you won't be able to master them anytime soon, especially not if you're wasting time on smut.\n\nThen, your \"job,\" rather than resisting porn/masturbation, becomes to rearrange your priorities such that your old habit of fapping is below enough other things that you just never get around to it. Eventually, you get used to a lifestyle focused on achieving goals and wasting less time and you become a bear-punching badass.\n\n(Note that punching bears is pretty dangerous and I don't particularly recommend it for purposes other than a running gag)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the first thing I&amp;#39;ll say is that my counter is only good for the number of days I&amp;#39;ve gone without inducing an orgasm and does not reflect any viewing of explicit material I may have done, so you can take it (and consequently my advice) with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that disclaimer, I&amp;#39;ll give you the short version of my story.

Rationalize momentarily how fapping isn&amp;#39;t going to help you achieve your goal(s), and instead identify some pursuits that will. While you&amp;#39;re at it, come up with some unrelated hobbies that interest you (bear punching?). Chances are, you&amp;#39;ll be able to come up with a list of things long/intense enough that you won&amp;#39;t be able to master them anytime soon, especially not if you&amp;#39;re wasting time on smut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, your &amp;quot;job,&amp;quot; rather than resisting porn/masturbation, becomes to rearrange your priorities such that your old habit of fapping is below enough other things that you just never get around to it. Eventually, you get used to a lifestyle focused on achieving goals and wasting less time and you become a bear-punching badass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Note that punching bears is pretty dangerous and I don&amp;#39;t particularly recommend it for purposes other than a running gag)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_352kfd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/NoFap/comments/352kfd/i_need_some_strategic_help/cr11ao1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/352kfd/i_need_some_strategic_help/", "name": "t1_cr11ao1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NoFap", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1430969189.0, "created_utc": 1430969189.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/352kfd/i_need_some_strategic_help/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2skrn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I need some strategic help", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "NoFap", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cr0c6ry", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SpectorBot", "num_comments": 4, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_352kfd", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_gs72l", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I personally do not advocate K9 or whatever.
