There are two main lessons a player must learn, and a bunch of secondary ones that stem from that.\n\nLesson 1: Play Well Individually\n\nThis is mostly the obvious part. If you're playing a sniper, get headshots, deal with counter sniping, and so on. Each class has their own foibles and learning curve. Engineer is probably the best class for the 'rote' aspects of this, as much of their early game strategy basically comes down to building perfectly at an optimal speed, like getting the sentry and dispenser up by the main spawn to cover the courtyard and both forward entries ASAP on round start. Other classes are more implicit, like knowing how to use the maps for scouts, spies, and soldiers.

I have considerable experience with coding *real* world applications (in customer\'s hands) for many-core (single die) architectures at this scale and [much] larger. I also write compilers for them. Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio?\n\nFor those who don\'t know about these devices, let me put it into GPU terms (SIMT only; SIMD is much, much harder to analyze): fetch would correspond to a texture sample, ALU is the work done on the sample. If the arch\'s fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4, then you need 4 (pure, non loading) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part "fed". A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low clock rate/memory rate ratio, and (nearly pure) SIMT. For instance, a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this.\n\nSIMT means "single instruction multiple thread" and refers to totally non-communicating processes. SIMD means "single instruction multiple data", where each lane is allowed to communicate. For instance, the SSE instruction HADD is SIMD, not SIMT, because the lanes of the vector unit "talk". Likewise, gather is SIMT, whereas permute is SIMD.\n\nFor many core (single die) devices, another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [vector] units, or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data. This means that for SIMT architectures, it is not just enough to have homogeneous per ALU [vector] work, but also homogeneous workload across the entire device.\n\nThis is entirely different from, say, the large scale server x86 boxes. These devices are truly high-throughput serial devices, designed to allow an enormous amount of thrash on the local working set.

While it is a third party program, it\'s impact on the game is minimal and avoidable (as seen in the OP\'s video).  It\'s also difficult to prove because some people might just be able to swap items quickly through practice.  OP\'s video did seem impossibly fast to me, but how would Blizzard be able to fairly gauge how fast is too fast for trade window swapping?  Besides, it still kind of goes along with what I\'ve been saying about how player actions shouldn\'t be banned.  Macros are designed to simulate an action that a player can do anyway, just faster.  This type of situation can be completely avoided in the future if Blizzard fixes the trade window to lock up for several seconds after any type of item swap is detected.\n\nIf OP is reading this far, I think your case would have been better accepted had you argued his offense was the use of a third party macro program, not the scam attempt itself.

If you don't cause trouble or blow your horn about drinking, you won't get into trouble. You should also know that NOBODY can enter your dorm room without your permission. An RA can open up and see if you're okay if he or she suspects you are in need of serious medical attention, service workers can enter when you are gone to affect repairs on internet, plumbing, electric, etc, and you must open up for Police IF AND ONLY IF they have a warrant for your arrest/search/seizure of property. THAT BEING SAID, do not abuse these benefits of living on campus. Be considerate to your neighbors and uniformed officials. Be respectful of those around you and be responsible for your actions. 2) You're going to get a lanyard. Don't. fucking. wear it. Put that shit away. Nobody wants to see your I.D. hanging from your neck, and everybody hates that you have your life attached to it, with the end hanging out of your pocket. Both of these are dumb-ass moves to pull.

Bringing your dough rapidly from chilled to oven temperature allows water to steam before the fat melts, keeping your cookie in one happy, homogeneous package - instead of spread onto your baking sheet.', 'summary': "Fat and water don't bond."}{'author': 'billsil', 'body': "* the bit on butter/ghee confusion comes from his eat-don't eat chart on oil/fats vs dairy.  on one he says not to eat them (oil/fat), the other (dairy) he does\n\n* ok, the bit on omega 3/6 balance is completely true, it's so hard balancing it.\n\n* i love my garlic &amp; onions :)\n\n* fermentation breaks down the antinutrients (and gluten) and it's great for your gut.  you should read up on it.  bread used to be fermented to make it rise rather than adding yeast.\n\ntldr; i really need to listen to the podcasts and not judge it based on the quick summary", 'normalizedBody': "\n the bit on butter/ghee confusion comes from his eat-don't eat chart on oil/fats vs dairy.  on one he says not to eat them (oil/fat), the other (dairy) he does \n \n ok, the bit on omega 3/6 balance is completely true, it's so hard balancing it. \n \n i love my garlic & onions :) \n \n fermentation breaks down the antinutrients (and gluten) and it's great for your gut.  you should read up on it.  bread used to be fermented to make it rise rather than adding yeast. \n \n \n tldr; i really need to listen to the podcasts and not judge it based on the quick summary \n", 'subreddit': 'Paleo', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qzzs', 'id': 'c6m2e4g', 'content': "the bit on butter/ghee confusion comes from his eat-don't eat chart on oil/fats vs dairy.  on one he says not to eat them (oil/fat), the other (dairy) he does \n \n ok, the bit on omega 3/6 balance is completely true, it's so hard balancing it. \n \n i love my garlic & onions :) \n \n fermentation breaks down the antinutrients (and gluten) and it's great for your gut.  you should read up on it.  bread used to be fermented to make it rise rather than adding yeast.", 'summary': 'i really need to listen to the podcasts and not judge it based on the quick summary'}{'author': 'Azurphax', 'body': 'Well, I suppose you are getting great color reproduction and screen response time  \n\nbut...

However, there are only so many layers of clothes you can take off to cool down though.

I have never had to do that, but I have physically injured myself getting into my car in the summer.  The door handle is hot, the seats are like fire, and the metal part of the seat belt will literally blister your fingers, or god forbid it touches some mid-drift.\n\nAlso, there is a complete lack of character in the greater valley\'s architecture.  All the homes are stucco, and they are all the same color.  We literally have cookie cutter neighborhoods.  All the homes in these very common neighborhoods are EXACTLY the same except a slight difference in shades for the exterior paint. Out Downtown is nice, and has character, but during the day, only a few blocks are active, and same during the night.  It\'s great to look out, but it is not where you want to live.  This is known, so the only homes there are shacks filled by meth addicts or illegal immigrants.

Only if you feel like walking 3 miles/4.8km in 110 degree/ 43 degree (Celsius) weather. \n\nOh, and we\'re also racists according to everyone else in the nation.  If they lived here and understood how much illegal immigration effects us, others would understand.  We begged the federal government for help, and they refused.  Shit got real and now we all have a bad name.\n\nOur education is ranked one of the lowest in the nation.  Some could say this is because of the large group of Spanish speaking students, the AIMS, or the teachers. \n\nOur winter\'s are nice for those who have "migrated" south.  Adapt to the weather, and all you get is the ability to freeze your ass off, with no snow. Win/Win?\n\nPhoenix has two seasons: Summer, and January.  No fall colors, no spring flowers.  (Ok, maybe we do, but it\'s very short lived, and as far as the fall colors go, you have to plant trees yourself to see that).\nIf you want to see the colors change, you have to go for a scenic drive or hike up in the northern part of the country.\n\nWe have horrible care for the mentally ill also.  As a matter of fact, if you are mentally ill, you usually get off the hook cause we don\'t know what else to do with you!\n\nThere are pros to living here, they just aren\'t things that you can\'t find anywhere else.\n\n**TL;DR ITS FUCKING HOT OUTSIDE**\n\n\n', 'normalizedBody': 'I live in Phoenix, Arizona. \n There\'s a lot that attracts people to the valley.

Just like set and setting for a trip. Now, acid or shrooms are more like...Son of Beast from Kings Island in Ohio; it\'s the biggest wooden roller-coaster in the world. Which means that, it\'s intense and really awesome, but it has kind of a rickety feel to it that doesn\'t leave you feeling completely safe/secure/worry-free the whole time. Mescaline, on the other hand, is the Millenium Force. It takes you higher and faster than almost any other ride, but the whole time you feel completely safe, secure, in control, and are just *loving* it. (DMT, obviously, would be the Top Thrill Dragster =P ) Mescaline just feels so clean and exhilarating and everything is so amazingly beautiful. It\'s the strongest positive/euphoric "push" I\'ve ever felt from a psychedelic, besides maybe 2C-P (or candyflipping).

To give you an example, the first time I met and really got to know my current girlfriend of 2 years (we were neighbors in a dorm, this was the first time we hung out), my roommates and I were all tripping balls on mescaline.

Now, her and her roommate are these two beautiful girls who we don\'t know at all and who (we would come to know but suspected) are totally innocent--neither of them had ever even drank or partied, much less smoked weed or done anything else. Anyway, while tripping balls on mescaline, I cooked a dinner for 5 people, we all had awesome conversation (despite being around new people who also happened to be gorgeous--probably would have been weird on acid or shrooms), they had no idea we were on anything and yeah long story short we\'ve been dating for over 2 years based on *that* first impression. That\'s still one of, if not the most magical day of my life (first mescaline trip). For reference, that was on 40 0.7g capsules (so 28g) of powdered dried Peruvian Torch cactus.

Anyway, while tripping balls on mescaline, I cooked a dinner for 5 people, we all had awesome conversation (despite being around new people who also happened to be gorgeous--probably would have been weird on acid or shrooms), they had no idea we were on anything and yeah long story short we\'ve been dating for over 2 years based on  that  first impression. That\'s still one of, if not the most magical day of my life (first mescaline trip). For reference, that was on 40 0.7g capsules (so 28g) of powdered dried Peruvian Torch cactus.

I\'d say the amount you have will almost certainly be enough to feel it, and is very unlikely to be too intense...If you\'ve never done mescaline, let me try to describe it. \n A trip is like a roller-coaster ride, right? It\'s intense, it\'s exhilarating, it\'s fun, but at times can also be scary, depending on specifics about the particular ride (shoddy state fair roller coaster vs. Cedar Point) as well as your mindset going on to it (you\'re unlikely to enjoy even an awesome roller coaster if you\'re sick/upset etc.). Just like set and setting for a trip. Now, acid or shrooms are more like...Son of Beast from Kings Island in Ohio; it\'s the biggest wooden roller-coaster in the world. Which means that, it\'s intense and really awesome, but it has kind of a rickety feel to it that doesn\'t leave you feeling completely safe/secure/worry-free the whole time. Mescaline, on the other hand, is the Millenium Force. It takes you higher and faster than almost any other ride, but the whole time you feel completely safe, secure, in control, and are just  loving  it. (DMT, obviously, would be the Top Thrill Dragster =P ) Mescaline just feels so clean and exhilarating and everything is so amazingly beautiful. It\'s the strongest positive/euphoric "push" I\'ve ever felt from a psychedelic, besides maybe 2C-P (or candyflipping). This is due to mescaline\'s phenethylamine structure; it is chemically more similar to MDMA or even amphetamine than to tryptamines like psilocybin (acid has structural similarities to both families). \n In the type of dose you should be getting yourself into, it\'s an  extremely  functional trip. To give you an example, the first time I met and really got to know my current girlfriend of 2 years (we were neighbors in a dorm, this was the first time we hung out), my roommates and I were all tripping balls on mescaline. I had invited her and her roommate over at our place for dinner (cooked by me) to get to know each other.

I'll come back to this in a second. \n Not only have I wanted to do that myself in the past, I have an aunt who has tried committing suicide on 3 occasions. We don't talk about it but my whole family aren't sure if/when we'll be getting a call about her. We've been devastated every time we've received a call saying she tried committing suicide. Her reasons are because of a chemical imbalance. Its been almost a decade since her last attempt and were so happy she's still around. \n Also I have a close friend who's father committed suicide. Every time I see or talk to her I see the effects of it. Shes a different person; don't get me wrong she's moved on and is living a happy life. But you can see the trauma sitting there, just under the surface. She fights depression now herself on the anniversary of his death every year. Her father sent her a final note in an email and she slept in that morning, she still blames herself. \n Finally back to me. Getting back from that ledge is a battle, and one I didn't want to fight most days. I'd lost sight of God so prayer was out of the question; and why would he even want someone like me anyway? My life wasn't so terrible but I still wanted to take it. I felt whiny and hated myself all the more for it. I didn't have health insurance either so seeing a doctor about if it was a chemical balance wasn't an option so I took it day by day to see i I could get better. I was a lucky one, I didn't tell anyone other than my mom. \n I found reasons to be happy with myself. I started reading Scripture. I found Gods love and mercy. I became happy. \n Its not an easy fight but it's a worthwhile one. I'm here if you need someone to talk to.", 'summary': "life is worthwhile even though it may not seem like it.

The dad would hand down ownership of the company to his son, and the only people who were managers in the company were either family members or people who were friends of the family. The workers in the company had no say in anything.\n\nEventually, the workers get tired of this and form a workers union to oppose management (communism is almost literally this in theory). Management doesn\'t like this and there is a big fight.\n\nNormally management would not lose this kind of fight, except outsiders (Japanese) had taken over the board of directors and were really running things in the company, with the management team as puppets. Management loses and the union, led by Sun Yat-Sen, takes over the company.\n\nShortly after this, Sun Yat Sun dies. Almost immediately, there is another fight. Some of the workers want to become the new owners of the company (Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT). They are supported by the US.\n\nThe other workers think that replacing one management team with another is not likely to solve anything, and decide that the union should actually be the ultimate owners of the company, and that management should work for them, not the other way around. This was led by Mao Zedong and was supported by the Soviets.\n\nBig fight, and Mao wins. The KMT retreat to Formosa, kick the natives to the curb, and create the ROC (Taiwan). So now the union (Communist Party) is in charge of the mainland (China).\n\nFrom their perspective, they are not really a political party like we would understand it. They are, in their minds, the representatives of the people, like union leaders. As a result, there really isn\'t a reason to vote for them, since they ARE the people. Voting and discussion is more about what the people are going to do and who they are going to appoint to do it.\n\nIf you think about what you know about unions, you\'ll note that normally there is only one union in the company. The workers don\'t usually vote for which union represents them. They may vote for which union members are in charge of various jobs, but the union is the union. Similarly, there is no opposing "party" to the Communist Party.\n\nI\'ve grossly oversimplified some things, but this is why China has a completely different system than the US, and why talking about political parties in the context actually doesn\'t make much sense. They actually have lots of elections and votes, but it\'s all low level things. The Party, as the direct representative of the people (theoretically) just acts on behalf of the people (theoretically) without any need for elections (theoretically).\n\nThis is also why the leaders of the country, like the President and Premier, are appointed by the Communist Party. There are votes and negotiations behind the scenes, but basically it\'s a case of the union being the Board of Directors and appointing the President, Secretary and Treasurer. They even use those terms.\n\nSo, not a democracy. But also not a dictatorship. The Premier reports to the Party. It\'s more of a rule by committee. It is very authoritarian, however.\n\nThe show that is going on right now over the National Peoples Congress is primarily to reassure the people that the Party is still representing them properly. So you will see lots of flowery speeches, discussions about what the people want, and so on. These are more about making sure that the Party appears to be aligned with the best interests of the people than about the decision making itself.\n\n**TL;DR:** the Communist Party isn\'t a political party, it\'s a workers union.

Voting and discussion is more about what the people are going to do and who they are going to appoint to do it. \n If you think about what you know about unions, you\'ll note that normally there is only one union in the company. The workers don\'t usually vote for which union represents them. They may vote for which union members are in charge of various jobs, but the union is the union. Similarly, there is no opposing "party" to the Communist Party. \n I\'ve grossly oversimplified some things, but this is why China has a completely different system than the US, and why talking about political parties in the context actually doesn\'t make much sense. They actually have lots of elections and votes, but it\'s all low level things. The Party, as the direct representative of the people (theoretically) just acts on behalf of the people (theoretically) without any need for elections (theoretically). \n This is also why the leaders of the country, like the President and Premier, are appointed by the Communist Party. There are votes and negotiations behind the scenes, but basically it\'s a case of the union being the Board of Directors and appointing the President, Secretary and Treasurer. They even use those terms. \n So, not a democracy. But also not a dictatorship. The Premier reports to the Party. It\'s more of a rule by committee. It is very authoritarian, however. \n The show that is going on right now over the National Peoples Congress is primarily to reassure the people that the Party is still representing them properly. So you will see lots of flowery speeches, discussions about what the people want, and so on. These are more about making sure that the Party appears to be aligned with the best interests of the people than about the decision making itself. \n TL;DR:  the Communist Party isn\'t a political party, it\'s a workers union.

The dad would hand down ownership of the company to his son, and the only people who were managers in the company were either family members or people who were friends of the family. The workers in the company had no say in anything. \n Eventually, the workers get tired of this and form a workers union to oppose management (communism is almost literally this in theory). Management doesn\'t like this and there is a big fight. \n Normally management would not lose this kind of fight, except outsiders (Japanese) had taken over the board of directors and were really running things in the company, with the management team as puppets. Management loses and the union, led by Sun Yat-Sen, takes over the company. \n Shortly after this, Sun Yat Sun dies. Almost immediately, there is another fight. Some of the workers want to become the new owners of the company (Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT). They are supported by the US. \n The other workers think that replacing one management team with another is not likely to solve anything, and decide that the union should actually be the ultimate owners of the company, and that management should work for them, not the other way around. This was led by Mao Zedong and was supported by the Soviets. \n Big fight, and Mao wins. The KMT retreat to Formosa, kick the natives to the curb, and create the ROC (Taiwan).

You\'re imagining the vast scale of the universe and assuming that anything is possible, but in this case its scale is the greatest obstacle. \n The universe is a large system of mostly stars, perhaps 9x10^21 in the observable universe. But it\'s a  single system  and therefore cannot "evolve" in any sense that would promote a degree of organization that might be construed as sentience. An eyedropper with 0.27 CC volume of water (less than six drops) has 9x10^21 molecules in it, and it\'s not going to be intelligent or even  living , because there is no conceivable process that would bring it to that point in isolation--as the universe most certainly is, and even if there were there\'s simply not enough complexity there to work with. \n Use ourselves as an example. An adult human brain masses about 1.4 kilograms. It\'s about 77% water, 11% lipids and 8% protein, so it has around 1.4 x 10^26 atoms.

Sure, it\'ll take a good 2 years to do so, but you save so much in costs, not just in tuition, but also for living arrangements. Additionally, if you\'re not originally a CA resident, attending a CA CC will give you time to establish residency (this will reduce tuition costs significantly, just in case the GI Bill doesn\'t cover 100%).\n\nAdditionally, some CCs have transfer agreements with Cal (mostly in Northern CA). Basically, you\'re "accepted", but just have to fulfill your necessary requirements (ie. core courses, GPA, etc). Note, that not *all* CCs have this program.

Paradoxically, these same sufferers sometimes find that they perseverate -- they get "stuck" on a train of thought or wrapped up in a task that may be a distraction or not what they "ought" to be attending to. \n It\'s a bit much for a Reddit post to get into how a flaw in this context maintenance system can be both very labile and sticky.  To grossly oversimplify, it\'s that the signals that "gate" in new things to attend to are not timed well or strong enough, and the "gates" themselves may neurophysiologically "swing" too easily.   Two important neurotransmitters help determine what gets into prefrontal cortex and when: dopamine and norepinephrine.  Ritalin amplifies the effects of both of these neurotransmitters in the brain (through reuptake inhibition). \n The', 'summary': "is this: Ritalin may help users attend my sharpening the signals that help the brain maintain attentional focus. I can go into this in more detail or point people to papers if they really want.  Note I more expert on the attentional systems of the brain itself than on ADHD/ADD as a disorder per se.  I've also been away from this for some time, but it's what I did my PhD work in."}{'author': 'ohmyshit', 'body': 'Please enlighten us what title would have made this *hilarious*?\n\nLooks like it was a shitty title for a shitty post, if you ask me.

Now, individually, like men, they are a lot more lenient on looks, however, I would not say more so than a man of the same maturity level.", 'summary': 'It doesn\'t seem right to put one sex regarding looks as less important than the other as both sexes feature a wide range of personalities and approaches to dating. \n Also, I acknowledged that it was somewhat less than that with women. "I have seen plenty of fat girls with boyfriends. Rarer, but not that much less than with women, I have seen attractive men date fatter women." \n I said that it was not that much less than attractive women with fat men. I honestly haven\'t seen either that often, so in my experience one isn\'t greater than the other. I added slightly less than women purely from gained experience from the internet, which increased both. I should have clarified. \n Here\'s the big thing, men are often the ones asking other\'s out. So, comparing women asking out fat men, and men asking out fat women( both attractive), in both cases they are relatively rare. However, if you add in accepting a date. In this regard, both cases rise up. In my experience, mature men and women, will both accept someone who they like personality wise, but who is on the pudgy side of things. It is hard to compare the two because current social standards have men asking out women, more often than women asking out men. I have seen very few women actually ask out the nice fat guy, but who would accept. Same with men, they wouldn\'t ask, but would accept. However, in both cases there are some who will ask out the fatter party. \n Sorry for the jumble, I am tired.'}{'author': 'Zorbick', 'body': 'Fresh out of school, eh?

Of which IWD has put in substantial time and effort in helping develop the pro scene to this point as he has been a part of it for an extensive amount of time. \n Gaming has, and always will be full of gamers. Since the beginning of gaming, people get hyped/emotional/jabber mouthed/etc. when things do not go as intended. This ranges from a 2 year old to a 50 year old. \n I have not been punished by the tribunal on any of my accounts, ever. However from the start of tribunal being implemented in the way it is, it started off being a GREAT idea, and quickly was realized that not all god ideas are implemented properly. \n This was the start, since first time since playing this game over 3 years ago that I have been disappointed with Riot. And this very harsh implementation only leaves me with a taste in my mouth that riot is pushing more towards catering to its masses (not top 20% elo) players, just as WoW did in its beginning after Blackwing lair I believe it was called. They made everything easy mode and more accessible to the casual gamer and continued to do so from what I've been told. \n I see this game doing the same thing in a different way, punishing players by perma-banning is already excessive considering the amount of time and money put in by the individual. This in itself is trying to change the nature of online gaming, competitive gamers as I stated above have historically had a raging nature. That is why they are playing a PURELY PVP based game. \n The root disruption of the game in my opinion is not typing ragers, you have plenty of options if your feelings are hurt by keystrokes. The biggest problem is people who do not communicate in team select/afk-ragequitter's. This disrupts the game the most, I have had plenty of ragers in my games and there is a mute button for each player in the game that any moron can figure out. If your feelings are hurt so much in a competitive environment I suggest you stick to candyland because regardless of Riot's stance on this, this behavior towards less skilled players will be in EVERY competitive style game til the end of gaming. The best players, want to win.", 'summary': 'Poor decision by riot trying to make a purely competitive pvp style game into happy joy land style game that appeals to the majority (masses), as this will never be successful d/t the nature of the most competitive players. This may be their focus in this game and people will adapt at that level for now, however this will be the nature of all very high competitive players forever.'}{'author': 'Phlebin_Harnwell', 'body': "I agree completely.

Fuck people before marriage. The body is sacred, which is why you SHOULD test drive it before "committing to owning". The reason is not because you should know how it feels, (because it feels pretty fucking good or it\'s awful, never really a middle ground about it), but because in those soft, silent moments after is the ground which make the earth tremble, the moments of bliss which will sincerely connect you to your partner. God DAMN nothing feels better than having finished mutually and then discussing about your lives, fears, woes, joys, memories, expectations, and hopes.

Does anyone spiritually sincerely believe dancing in circles in front of dead gods will legitimize a bond that you feel for another human being? There is no boundary which keeps people, in the afterlife or without, together that could expresses love any more or less. The act of marriage is a tradition which solidifies possession over individuals, which doesn\'t sound like, "to honor, to cherish". Inviting family and friends, however wonderful a community gathering could be, is a con for gifts and to ward off any male or female predators. The only joy I could possibly foresee is the Bride\'s, "One Day", but that is reinforcing a HUGE negative social stereotype which is capturing the absolute beauty of a woman in her prime, her aesthetics, and her youth. After that day, THAT\'S IT! Either back to yoga to keep up obsessing over a wedding dress that you will never wear again for the rest of your life or always wondering if you could COMPARE TO YOUR WEDDING DAY. You know the most beautiful I\'ve ever seen a woman? It was after my buddy\'s kid was born. His partner was so freaking beautiful in intention, motivation, and was in complete aww over a tangible journey which lead to the most beautiful life on this planet. But when she got out of the hospital, only myself and their parents were there to help and be a part of their lives. I wouldn\'t say that they need to rush the couple, but the community could do more for the lives of those they supposedly cherish than to sit, kneel, stand, aww, eat, drink, dance, cheers, and go home.

It\'s a refinement of six years of work and development as a band, and the undeniable pinnacle of songwriting achievement for Metallica.

So naturally, I watched about 45 minutes worth of sad videos and then I come across the no cry challenge. He asks what it was and I explain, and start to tell him about the saddest video from yesterday. I can\'t remember the name of it, but it was about 7 minutes long and it was a camera crew following and documenting the final moments of this man and his dog. The dog had cancer I believe. He had all of his friends say goodbye and him and his wife/girlfriend took the dog to the vet to have him put down and this man was just in tears, as was I. So I then proceed to tell him about the time when I had to go put my dog down because he needed a surgery we couldn\'t afford. I told him how much pain my dog was in, and how badly I was crying and how when the lady put the injection in, how I could slowly see peace coming into his eyes. At this point in the story, I happen to look up (we weren\'t really looking at each other because we were cleaning so I was completely oblivious to his reaction and just kept running my mouth) and he says please stop, I can\'t talk about this. And he turned around and had to compose himself for a few minutes. I felt AWFUL. I still feel awful. It got really awkward and we didn\'t really talk much for the last few hours.

Settle in.\n\nSo the summer between grade 9 and 10, I took a "Reach Ahead" summer school course so that I only had to take it over 4 weeks instead of a whole semester. In this class was this totally awesome girl that I got partnered with for a couple projects early on. She was a wiccan and kinda goth but really fun to be around. Young devoutly catholic me fell for her head over heels, but I was a shy and nervous kid. When we were about half way through the third week we were in the computer lab for an assignment, and I kept bugging her to send me an email, even though she was sitting right next to me. I told her that it was because I didn\'t have her on MSN yet (which was true), and she kept saying she\'d just give it to me after class. Eventually she relented and sent me an email. Not a minute later I sent her an email asking her out. I was too shy to actually say it, and she thought it was cute. \n\nWe went out that weekend and we started spending a lot of our free time together, eventually becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. On the last day of summer school, we stayed behind after classes were done, and sat on one of the buildings and just talked and watched the empty field. We had an amazing kiss and afterward she told me she loved me. She was the first girl to ever tell me that. We kept dating in the school year, but for a couple of younger kids, going to separate schools and only seeing each other about twice a month got too hard, and around Christmas we broke up. It was kinda rough going but I got through it.\n\nThe next summer we started hanging out more and decided to get back together again. Thing were pretty good until one day when she got super mad at me for not calling her back to go to an evanescence concert. What had happened was she phoned my house and my sister picked up and took a message. One that she never passed on. Despite all that, we had a pretty big fight, and broke up again.\n\nI had just started to get over it again when I logged into facebook one day and I see her best friends status: "R.I.P (ex\'s name), I\'ll miss you".

In characterization, it\'s insulting in the way it constantly portrays these nerds as sexist, arrogant and spineless, introverted, socially and emotionally inept (all have Mommy issues, all seem "virginal", all are prepubescent in behavior, all have the same fandoms, the same dislikes). I\'m fine with laughing at these silly stereotypes, but no one challenges their labels, no one actually shows they are a multidimensional character in this story--they all merely follow their typical archetype.

First serious girlfriend, we were together for over a year and spent a lot of time with each other\'s families, who we each got along with great.\n\nSometime in the 8th grade she calls me saying that she was rapped.  I tell her to tell her parents, or call the police... something.  She doesn\'t want to, just wants to be left alone for a while.  I go to confront the guy after figuring out who he is.  Guess what?  She is with him.  The rape was a lie, she turns out to be a slut.\n\nWhatever, I am young and can move on.

Apparently she was horny the whole time we were dating, I never made a major sexual advancement towards her, so she got the D elsewhere.  We did the normal fooling around, but at 14 I wasn\'t even thinking about taking things to the next level.\n\nShe spent the rest of our high school years trying to get back with me, while I did everything could to avoid her.  I still think she was obsessed over me because I was persistent in ignoring her efforts. \n\nFast forward a couple years... I am a manager at a local pizza restaurant.  She is married with a small child now and is in desperate need of a job.  Despite my better judgement I get her a job.  This is where the craziness starts.\n\nShortly after getting hired it is clear that she is still obsessed.  She finds out where I live, keeps coming by.  I keep rejecting her.

That breaks down into roughly $10/week or $2 per weekday (most people don\'t hit the gym on the weekend, but we need this number later, so it ends up being roughly $1.43/day). In order to recoup your losses to the gym, you need to be able to make back $1.43 while at the gym every weekday.\n\nI suggest investing into a medium-risk mutual fund.

First, I am not nor will I ever claim to be a hacker or even a script kiddie. I\'m just a first year computer science student and these are the best examples I could come up with on short notice.None of it is real. Second, Yes I know a lot of this is outdated. It was written to be an example of how hacking works, not a technical manual. Third, I know that hacking doesn\'t explicitly, or even implicitly, mean breaking into a system. A hacker is more like someone who isn\'t satisfied until he learns exactly how a certain technology or system works and is constantly trying to learn more.  Finally thanks for the Karma and I hope reddit enjoys my explanation.\n\nEdit: Where I learned the little I know\n- [Exam cram] (\n-  \n\nThat is a very complicated question but, I\'ll see if I can hit some of the basics for you.\n\nFirst you need to know what hacking is\n\n- Hacking is using or accessing a technology in a way that is contrary to the intentions of, or permissions given by, the owner, operator, or creator of said technology.\n\nSo in layman\'s terms, Hacking is using flaws in technology to gain access to, or change, information on a computer system.What are these "flaws"? Well, that is when it starts to get complicated. Just know that these flaws can usually be narrowed down to three categories: human, hardware, and software.  I\'ll try to give a decent example of each.\n\nHuman: One of the easiest things to protect yourself from, and one of the most common techniques, is tricking people into giving you access to their systems. This can easily be done on people who have a limited understanding of computer security or people who don\'t practice proper security measures. This kind of hacking is commonly referred to as "social engineering". It is also the kind most often used by famous computer hacker and security expert Kevin Mitnick. If you want to know more about the life of a hacker then google him and read his books.\n\n Now an example, Let\'s say I work for company XYZ and my manager  is Mr Man. Well, Mr Man is a douche and I am planning on quitting soon but, before I leave I want to get some revenge on him by hacking his account. So here is what I do. I wait till Mr Man leaves for lunch then sneak into his office and get on his computer. I could access his account from my computer but the tech department would be able to see where I logged in from and realize that it wasn\'t logged in from his office computer. They would soon know something is wrong, and I don\'t want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don\'t know his password to get back in! That\'s when I remember, the new IT guy started today and they always make the new guys deal with simple or common problems at first. Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won\'t know best security practices and, I\'m certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can\'t login. I\'m in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I\'m sure of it. So, I tell him that I\'m Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell "Shit, It\'s almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don\'t have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say \'you\'re fired\', you understand me?" Now a normal worker wouldn\'t fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let\'s see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station. Now, because they don\'t have cameras inside they have no way to pin it on me and I quit work the next day and get away free. Mission accomplished!\n\nHacking lesson - 1) Normal people are ignorant of computer security, take advantage of them.\n\nHardware:\n\nI want access to somebody\'s documents on their computer. If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don\'t though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn\'t ask for a password but, let\'s be honest.

Well, that is when it starts to get complicated. Just know that these flaws can usually be narrowed down to three categories: human, hardware, and software.  I\'ll try to give a decent example of each. \n Human: One of the easiest things to protect yourself from, and one of the most common techniques, is tricking people into giving you access to their systems. This can easily be done on people who have a limited understanding of computer security or people who don\'t practice proper security measures. This kind of hacking is commonly referred to as "social engineering". It is also the kind most often used by famous computer hacker and security expert Kevin Mitnick. If you want to know more about the life of a hacker then google him and read his books. \n Now an example, Let\'s say I work for company XYZ and my manager  is Mr Man. Well, Mr Man is a douche and I am planning on quitting soon but, before I leave I want to get some revenge on him by hacking his account. So here is what I do. I wait till Mr Man leaves for lunch then sneak into his office and get on his computer. I could access his account from my computer but the tech department would be able to see where I logged in from and realize that it wasn\'t logged in from his office computer. They would soon know something is wrong, and I don\'t want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don\'t know his password to get back in! That\'s when I remember, the new IT guy started today and they always make the new guys deal with simple or common problems at first. Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won\'t know best security practices and, I\'m certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can\'t login. I\'m in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I\'m sure of it. So, I tell him that I\'m Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell "Shit, It\'s almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don\'t have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say \'you\'re fired\', you understand me?" Now a normal worker wouldn\'t fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let\'s see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station. Now, because they don\'t have cameras inside they have no way to pin it on me and I quit work the next day and get away free. Mission accomplished! \n Hacking lesson - 1) Normal people are ignorant of computer security, take advantage of them. \n Hardware: \n I want access to somebody\'s documents on their computer. If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don\'t though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn\'t ask for a password but, let\'s be honest. How often do normal people enter the bios on their computers?  Mission accomplished! \n Hacking lesson - 2) Software security is useless without hardware security. Lock that shit up! \n Software: \n Software is much more complicated to explain. If you want know more about this start googling "sql injection", "Javascript Injection", "DDOS", "bruteforce hacking", "URL Manipulation" and any other term you come across while doing so. Just realize, these concepts maybe be hard to understand if you don\'t have a basic understanding of programming or how the internet works. I\'ll try to give a brief example though. \n I was playing an MMO the other day and was just about to finish defeating a boss character when some asshole came by and stole my kill.

Well, Mr Man is a douche and I am planning on quitting soon but, before I leave I want to get some revenge on him by hacking his account. So here is what I do. I wait till Mr Man leaves for lunch then sneak into his office and get on his computer. I could access his account from my computer but the tech department would be able to see where I logged in from and realize that it wasn\'t logged in from his office computer. They would soon know something is wrong, and I don\'t want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don\'t know his password to get back in!

Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won\'t know best security practices and, I\'m certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can\'t login. I\'m in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I\'m sure of it. So, I tell him that I\'m Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell "Shit, It\'s almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don\'t have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say \'you\'re fired\', you understand me?" Now a normal worker wouldn\'t fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let\'s see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station. Now, because they don\'t have cameras inside they have no way to pin it on me and I quit work the next day and get away free. Mission accomplished!\n\nHacking lesson - 1) Normal people are ignorant of computer security, take advantage of them.\n\nHardware:\n\nI want access to somebody\'s documents on their computer. If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don\'t though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn\'t ask for a password but, let\'s be honest. How often do normal people enter the bios on their computers? Mission accomplished!\n\nHacking lesson - 2) Software security is useless without hardware security. Lock that shit up!\n\nSoftware:\n\nSoftware is much more complicated to explain. If you want know more about this start googling "sql injection", "Javascript Injection", "DDOS", "bruteforce hacking", "URL Manipulation" and any other term you come across while doing so. Just realize, these concepts maybe be hard to understand if you don\'t have a basic understanding of programming or how the internet works. I\'ll try to give a brief example though.\n\nI was playing an MMO the other day and was just about to finish defeating a boss character when some asshole came by and stole my kill. Now, were it a normal monster I would just shrug it off and move on but, I had been trying to defeat this monster forever and was just about to win. I was pissed! So before the guy leaves, I pretend to thank him because "I was about to die". I then friend him so I can keep track of when he is online and remember his username. Later that day I get back on the game and check to see if he is on. He\'s not! I logout of my character and type his username in to the login screen. Using some online bruteforce hacking tools and a little coding of my own I put together a program that continuously tries to login to his account changing the password every time it fails.

However most people don\'t use complicated passwords, especially on online games. If this website followed good security practices they would limit the amount of login attempts possible from a certain IP address in a certain period of time or lock an account with to many incorrect login attempts. Unfortunately the creators of this game did no such thing. I head to the kitchen to fix myself some french bread pizza and wait. In a little over an hour I hear a beeping noise, the sound I programmed it to make when it succeeded. I head back to my computer and there it is. I\'m logged in to his account!

They would soon know something is wrong, and I don\'t want to get caught. So, there I am at his computer when suddenly my luck runs out, Mr Man had logged out and I don\'t know his password to get back in! That\'s when I remember, the new IT guy started today and they always make the new guys deal with simple or common problems at first. Since this is a new guy I am confident that he won\'t know best security practices and, I\'m certain I can trick him into getting me logged in. So I call the company tech department and say that I forgot my password and can\'t login. I\'m in luck, they hand the phone to some guy and he sounds very nervous. This has to be him, I\'m sure of it. So, I tell him that I\'m Mr Man and that I seem to have forgotten my password. He is about to ask me what I assume would be a security question when I yell "Shit, It\'s almost 3:00. Listen man, I have a very important client that will be here in a matter of minutes and I NEED to get back on my computer. I don\'t have time for the normal speel. Just get me a new password and let me get back to work or I swear you will lose your job faster than I can say \'you\'re fired\', you understand me?" Now a normal worker wouldn\'t fall for this but this guy was new and got scared. He fell for my act completely. Now with the new password in hand, I login to his account and get to work. Let\'s see... deleting all his documents? Sounds like fun! Download gay porn? Why not! After, a few minutes of this I leave and get back to my station.

If I had another computer I could use, I would simply remove the hard drive from this computer and connect it as a secondary drive on mine. I don\'t though, so instead I have to use my trusty flashdrive with a boot-able version of linux installed on it. However in order to use that I have to change the boot order, which is determined by the bios. I restart their computer and enter the bios setup... or try to anyways. It turns out that they have a password on their bios.Now what? Because of my knowledge of computer hardware, I know that the bios password is saved on the motherboard in the cmos, which has volatile memory. This means that if the cmos loses power, everything resets back to its default state and all passwords and other information (like time, date and boot order) are lost. So I simply open up the computer, find the lithium battery that powers the cmos and remove it. After waiting a minute to insure all the data is lost I put the battery back in and close up the computer. Turning on the computer, I try to enter the bios again. Success! It is no longer password protected. I then go into the section where you determine the boot order and change it so that the usb ports boot before the hardrive. Now I restart the computer again and wait. It worked! The linux login screen is now showing. I login to my account on the flashdrive and get to work. From the linux operating system I can access the info on the other hard drive. So, I grab all the files I want and copy them to my flash drive. I then log out, restart the computer and change the boot order back to normal. If somebody enters the bios they will know something happened when it doesn\'t ask for a password but, let\'s be honest.

I\'ll try to give a brief example though.\n\nI was playing an MMO the other day and was just about to finish defeating a boss character when some asshole came by and stole my kill. Now, were it a normal monster I would just shrug it off and move on but, I had been trying to defeat this monster forever and was just about to win. I was pissed! So before the guy leaves, I pretend to thank him because "I was about to die". I then friend him so I can keep track of when he is online and remember his username. Later that day I get back on the game and check to see if he is on. He\'s not! I logout of my character and type his username in to the login screen. Using some online bruteforce hacking tools and a little coding of my own I put together a program that continuously tries to login to his account changing the password every time it fails.

The first is that no matter what you do, you cannot take back the fact that you have been victimized. The second is, you never bring the police to your house. No good can come of it. So, we decide it isn\'t worth bringing the fuzz into. Fast forward a few days, and this little shit is outside in our cul-de-sac with his friends, lingering outside our lawn. He and his friends are younger than I, but older than my brothers. Having been threatened by kids like these a lot, my brothers don\'t even want to go outside in their own lawn. I snap at this point. All the anger I\'ve felt about what this kid has done, the intimidation my family has felt, the racism (strange hearing from a white guy, but its true) was let lose on this kid. To be honest, I can\'t even remember what I said, I was raging. At some point I called him a "God damn cock-sucking piece of shit" (Wow, right?) and one of our neighbors called the police. I never went to hit him or anything, but I could be heard screaming from inside others houses. When they showed up, the kid played up his fear, which he had been previously trying to hide. Cop took his story, and was going to arrest me for intimidation and blasphemy. (or something like that, this happened years ago) I couldn\'t believe it when he said blasphemy. I told him I couldn\'t wait to hear what the news would have to say about that, which didn\'t please him much. Thankfully my parents came out at this point and did a much better job of talking the cop down, even mentioning the back story of what had happened. Cop let me go, put a little fear in the kid, and left. We moved about a year later. Sorry about the novel, but some back story was necessary to put my shit-fit into perspective.', 'summary': 'Kid vandalized our house, gets away with it.

After a few months we started trying 'more'- I peed on sticks for a month to track my ovulation, I tracked how my body felt during each month and I made conscious efforts to say 'hey- i'm ovulating, sex tonight!'- not the most romantic but trying to accomplish a goal darn it lol.  A year or so goes by and nothing.  I talk to my doctor about how I have painful ovulation, he doesn't offer much and I should have switched doctors but I was afraid of IVF and such.  So we started looking into adoption and foster care.  I went to a meeting on foster care that scared the general crap out of me and didn't know what to do. All the while still having unprotected sex and hoping for the best.  \nMarch rolled around and we had a business trip together to Vegas.  In between working we partied like crazy people.  The week was a serious blur, but towards the end I remember saying to my husband that I can't stress about pregnancy anymore.  It's always in the back of my mind and its killing me, I need a break.  No more worrying about it for a while.  I know a million people told me not to stress before but that is easier said than done, I had to hit my breaking point. \n\nSo we came home and April was another blur.  Talk about partying- beerfests, hockey playoffs, tailgating, and then at the end of April I had an old friend in town for fleet week and I 'ended' the month with like 5 tequila shots, 5 beers, 2 cigars, and puking my brains out.  \n\n2 days later I realized my period should be there or almost there and I had no usual spotting and didn't really remember having painful ovulation or over sensitive boobs.

Spent ten days in Africa, did nothing, lost faith. \n', 'subreddit': 'atheism', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qh2p', 'id': 'c7ua1y5', 'content': 'Story time: In \'07 I was chosen to be a part of a 7-person group to visit some missionaries we supported in South Africa. I was sixteen, brainwashed, and on fire for this trip. Total cost PER PERSON to go? $2,300. As a team, we held fundraisers, we spoke each and every Sunday and Wednesday at church to encourage people to give money toward this great cause and the great work that we were going to do. We basically told people that they were wrong and selfish if they didn\'t support the missions program. \n So we get about a week out and everyone\'s got their money and we\'re getting ready to go. We get the final itinerary for our ten-day trip and while looking it over I started to notice something seemed a bit off, although I couldn\'t put my finger on it. We are meeting every day at this point to rehearse the skits and things we\'ll be doing while we\'re over there. \n We get to SA and are picked up at the airport by the missionary, her "assistant" or "head pastor" in a big conversion van. We get to her place and let me tell you: it is nice. Not nice as in she\'s living like a queen or even maybe how we would think of really  nice  in America, but compared to these other people, her place is a palace. She\'s got running water, she\'s got tons of food, she\'s got extra space and tv and everything. Not too bad, I thought, this will be nice. \n Throughout our ten days, we didn\'t  do  anything. We didn\'t bring food. We didn\'t build anything. We didn\'t provide medical care. We didn\'t hardly break a sweat. We ate like kings. We were always full. We drove thirty miles one day to go to the MALL. To SHOP. For OURSELVES. We ate burgers and fries and coleslaw from an overpriced restaurant with the extra  spending money  that we had brought from extra donations. \n Let me tell you something about Tzaneen, South Africa, folks. There are poor people there. There are no poor people in America. Yeah, we have homeless, "hungry", etc. But there\'s always a place for shelter and resources for help. In many of the villages, there is one water well. That one water well gets water let to it from the city two times a week for two hours at a time. The entire village must share and collect as much water as they possibly can during this time for all of their drinking, bathing, etc. \n There is no readily available food. Many steal just to provide anything for their families. When the girls are old enough (young teens) they start to prostitute themselves to put food on the table. The living conditions are terrible. Imagine a cubicle at a bank. Double that, throw in some dirt floors, shoddy, weathered wooden walls, thatched roof with holes all over the place, and throw in a family of five: eldest brother (19) who works all week in the city and is never at home. Next four range in age from 5-17. Both daughters prostitute themselves. There is no bed. There is no regular source of food. Both parents have died from AIDS. All of the children have AIDS from their mother. \n Now imagine driving by in a van as big as their home, drinking water from a fucking bottle, complaining that it\'s too hot because the A/C is broken and you just happen to way 350 pounds (hellooooo, Pastor)! The motherfucking nerve. This is when I really started to notice things were off. Did we stop? Fuck, no. We saw one of the kids at service that night in their village, though. Of course we told them that God was great and provided for all of His children. Fuck that. \n Another day we were door-to-door witnessing. My team of four took a small village at the top of a "mountain" (read, big hill). It was about a half an hour walk up to the top. I met a lady in her mid-forties, in a tattered green shirt, long skirt cached with dirt, and a leapord-print headdress. She was dirty, smelly, and looked a type of sad that I could never begin to understand. It was my turn to witness. \n "Do you know about Jesus, miss? Do you know what a great and wonderful, kind and loving God I have come to tell you about?"... and it hit me like a hulk-fist to the stomach: What God is going to help this woman? What God is going to bring back the son that she hadn\'t seen or heard from in two weeks, who had been involved in the local gang activity? What God was going to provide her her next drink of water? No God was going to do these things for her.... \n I finished praying with her, because I didn\'t know what else to do. She accepted Christ, Hallelujah! Glory to His name! I felt... numb. We had been here for six days at this point and hadn\'t done a single real thing for anybody. \n "Alright, cn2092, we\'re headed back down. We should get moving before it gets too hot!" \n I couldn\'t move. Here I was, holding two bottles of water for the  terribly difficult  journey I had embarked upon. I was wearing my favorite hat to shield my face because, God forbid I get sunburn! As the others were walking away, I turned around and found that lady. I told her in my English, without the translator, to take these bottles and this hat, and to take care and that I would keep her in my prayers. To my shame, this is the only thing I  did  the entire ten days I was in Africa. It was the only thing  any  of us  did . \n We spent all that money, all that time, all that energy, to go on a fucking church tour and tell some of the poorest, most downtrodden people on Earth what a great God we served. How He was the ultimate provider, healer, and comforter. \n Before we left, I gave all of the clothes I had taken over except for what I was wearing home. I left the rest of my snacks and I bought as much water as I could with what spending money I had left. \n A big part of me died over there. My faith did, for sure. My faith in people, my faith in the church, my faith in Christians, and my faith in God. \n Not sure why I typed all this out. I know nobody will read it; way too long. But I guess I needed to get it out - at least some of it, anyway. So much more I could rant on about. My heart still breaks to think of all that money wasted. $16,000.

She shows how everything from cost cutting to our portrayal in the media is hurting nursing. When I\'m at home I can compile a book list.\n\n1. The image of nursing: take a look at media portrayals of nursing. Most are foils or sidekicks to more interesting and important doctor characters. Medical shows show doctors doing things that are nursing responsibility that no doctor would ever do. Even the positive portrayals reinforce the "angel of mercy" image of our job... The emotional, sensitive, caring touch that is portrayed as intuitive to caring people, not involving skill or education. Have you ever seen a nurse leader? A nurse researcher? A CRNA or NP? A nurse expertly running a code? Nope. This reinforces to the public that we are sweet and caring, not technically skilled and highly educated.\n\n2. Nursing\'s place in the healthcare team: we are both not respected for our expertise and expected to be jack of all trades.  We all know that in many places and environments medical education is slow to adopt a true teamwork attitude. I see no reason to harp on this. Many physicians see themselves not as a part of the team but supreme dictator. Many are not trained or encouraged to value or recognize our expertise. The good ones come to recognize this on their own.\nAt the same time, most of us have had the experience of needing to fill multiple roles. Because when there are staffing and budget cuts, it falls to nursing. No one to clean the rooms or stretchers? No social worker to arrange transport? No tech to stock your supplies? No NA or PCT to help feed or turn or check sugars? No phlebotomy? The answer is always the nurse. More and more *our role as the last line of patient advocacy is being manipulated to unsafely increase our workload and responsibility*.  Nurses are managing sicker and sicker patients and accepting more and more responsibility without necessarily giving up any to other healthcare team members.\n\n3. The changing nature of health and illness in the county: the push to decrease he level of care with sicker and sicker patients leaves us taking care of more. The patients who would\'ve been in the ICU for weeks are going to the floors sooner and sooner, and floors to home or nursing facilities sooner. It\'s a push to save money but it pushes high acuity onto people already at strained nurse to patient ratios.\n\n4. The money push: nurses, especially good nurses, are not "money makers" for hospitals the way a good surgeon can be. They do not independently charge for services, and are viewed as a cost of running a facility. Therefore they are manipulated to "maximum efficiency" in terms of patient ratios and workload. However because the way maximum efficiency is measured is mostly by some rather arbitrary and certainly not all-encompassing metrics, administrators cannot be convinced of the value of decreasing patient ratios so RNs can give "good care". Also see above, the push is to put patients in lower acuity (read: less costly nursing care) as soon as possible without any costly adverse events.\n\n5. Moral distress: this is a huge factor of burnout in many nurses. Most of us just really want to give good care to our patients. We could choose a more glamourous job, an easier one, a better paying one... But we really want to take care of our patients. However we are shackled and every turn. We have to fight to use our judgment and get a physician order for practically everything, even when we know better than them. We have to fight to keep even our wretched staffing ratios. We have to take over the jobs of other team members like techs and case managers when their jobs are slashed from the budget. We have to document and double document to make our employers covered from lawsuits (and ourselves) and to prove we are meeting core measures.  At the end of the day we often don\'t feel like we had enough time to do everything we wanted to do for our patients. Add to that the stress from difficult patients and the other problems listed and you see why people burn out. You get into the job to do the right thing and give excellent care, and you can\'t. Not because you don\'t have the skills, or the drive. It\'s the barriers put in your way, the other responsibilities pulling you in a million different directions. And it\'s WRONG and you KNOW IT. It hurts you that you couldn\'t be in the room with your comfort care patient and family but you had to prep your other patient and take them to the cath lab and you STILL stayed an hour late to finish your paperwork. It eventually burns your emotional reserve.\n\n6. Nursing culture/a united nurse front: our infighting and problems are no secret. "Eat your young" culture in what is still a heavily apprenticeship based profession is our own poison pill. As listed, we have enough going against us, we need to stick together if we want to survive.  Additionally, as a profession we cannot even present a united front on our own education and standards. We can\'t agree on how to get into our field so how the heck can we present a united front to fight powerful organizations that are causing the problems I listed? A powerful, dominant physician culture? Highly profitable insurance companies? Corporation backed, money-first administration? As a profession we are challenged and what do we do? Complain about burned out old nurses, know-nothing new nurses, being forced to get a BSN, not getting with the times with an ADN. And physician dominance, insurance profits, healthcare facility corporations have been cashing in on our bitter infighting and probably watching with glee the fact that we can\'t get ourselves together enough to give them a fair fight.\n\nI didn\'t cover everything, but I feel this gives a good overview of the issues we have.\n\nTl;dr: we got issues.', 'normalizedBody': 'This is a well written post and I don\'t know your purpose so I\'ll try to address a few things.\nFIRST: the work of Suzanne Gordon and a few others.

She never knew exactly what she was crying about, but the feelings had just risen out of her during the passion of sex. \n The second happened after a particularly good session. We had both been feeling good, and after one of her orgasms, she started laughing so hard she couldn't talk. We had to communicate over written notes for about a half hour until she could speak again. Never figured out why, but that session sticks in my mind as a interesting reverse of the usual emotional lows. \n A bad partner will treat these emotional highs and lows as distractions, or worse, plow right through them and try to continue.

When they go to the doctor, they are men, because at a biological and health level (AKA  the context ), they are men. I call them 'her', refer to them in the feminine, and accept their choice of labeling in the social and relative  contexts  because they are whatever they want to be  in that context . \n So, if that was sarcastic humorish trolling, kudos. You totally win, and I hope you enjoyed the snack. \n If you were serious though, I think you need to get off your instant judgement high horse and think about the context and the definition of the situation in relevance to the OP's situation. Not every situation ( the context ) is the same, and we must be flexible in our understanding to be able to appropriately treat a situation with the best tools and language for the situation. By requiring or pushing everybody in all situations to use an absolute definition that fits best with the context of your life, you are actually hurting every situation that does not match the context of your life. In other words, the universe does not revolve around your preferences or belief systems, and don't tell me what word to use for anybody but you specifically. If OP had said what you just said, this response would not exist.

What you do is you put up for sale 1 commodity (of anything, gem, tome, etc) at the lowest possible price (100g) , then you immediately buy 1 and... since you are the lowest price you buy it from yourself and regain your item. You lose 15 gold each time you do it for the commission which is absolutely nothing. You keep doing this as fast as possible and force the average price down. The net result is within a few minutes you can cut the average price in half. You then place small orders to gobble up the cheapies that people recently put up in the last few minutes at the new lower average price. As more people list at that lower average price it also helps lower the average trade price, and you fervently buy as much as you can. You time this to do it at peak times later in the night when you imagine people finishing their runs, selling and logging off. Often people just dump their mats at the average price the game recommends, which having been manipulated, is half or less of what everyone else is listing at.  the true fair price is the one that says last day of trades, where the one that says last 10 trades is heavily manipulated \n After manipulating the average trade price down you gobble up all the cheap stuff for example gems at 2543 then relist them at 5999 which is the actual fair market. You can also incite a fake buying rally, everyone sees gems are so cheap suddenly and place huge orders only to see that they win them at 5999 not the 3200 avg price. \n You bought 100 gems for 3k each 5 minutes ago and instantly turned them around for double what you bought for. You just made 250k gold in about 5 minutes. Do this all day long til you have hundreds of millions, then sell the gold on the RMAH if you\'re a true free market capitolist or chinese. I imagine gold farmers are doing this now since its the fastest way to make gold and its rare I don\'t see any commodity being manipulated.  this is so not rare and happening the majority of the time  The more liquid and frequently bought the commodity is the easier it is to do. If you know that 1000 gems are going to be put up for sale in the next 30 minutes and you can lower the average price to make those people list it at a lower price, you are effectively naming your own price for the gems as the market maker and only you know their real value is much higher.  You can do it on perfect star gems too and bring them down 3-6 million or more but there are only a dozen or so trades by the end of the day, since its not as liquid you have to very patient and you risk just actually bringing the price down if you are unable to buy out all the cheaper ones to flip. Its a lot of patience for the 15 million gold you\'ll make but still relatively easy. \n Blizzard is aware of this and drastically increased the "avg last day transactions" a lot so its a higher average and less prone to manipulation but its still very easy to change any of this around if you are patient and persistently list at 100g and then buy from yourself... i\'m afraid this will never stop until blizzard stops displaying the last trade average or raises that to the last 10,000 trades instead of 10. \n If you hate the idea of this, note that the real world financial markets work in the exact same way and how hedge funds make most of their money (the average stock is held for less than a few days, no one invests long anymore), and if it still makes you upset, you can fight back! Just buy 1 commodity at regular intervals (every 3-5 seconds) - if you time it right you can actually catch those 100g commodity items every time before the actual seller is able to buy them back. This is how you can get brimstone or star gems for 100g if you are able to "catch" the manipulation and take advantage of it by buying the item before the seller has a chance to buy it back. Start doing this anytime you see the average price fluctuating wildly and going down, that means a manipulator is at work!   Full disclosure, I saw the same thing going on and figured it out after I kept winning gems for 100g and wondered who would be so stupid to do that...then I realized whats happening. I never found any items worth more than 500k to sell on the AH so I tried it out - and turned 2 million gold into 20 million gold over a few days and then I got tired of it, its mindnumbingly borring but it can get you that upgrade you want which is just what I did. \n **', 'summary': 'Yes, this is happening nearly constantly but the risk to play is even less than what you thought. The way it works is you list 1 commodity for 100g and instantly buy it from yourself, do this as fast as possible til the avg price goes down as much as half or more, then you place small orders to gobble up the cheapies people just listed or anyone who panicked and lowered their price.  The average last trades price is totally manipulated'}{'author': 'skynerd', 'body': "Oklahoman turned Chicagoan here.\n\nTo echo other respondents, what is it YOU are into?

Yes their are always going to be idiots that stoup religious bullshit but and satire and jokes are good to help get past such things but first we need to show we aren\'t their enemy otherwise we only build on their hate we need to show that we can extend the olive branch by just maybe saying: \n "Hay I know some of your rules are outdated but without you none of awe modern rules and laws may never have gone in to place some admittedly bad but, most of which good and stuff the helped father humanity while still keeping control/peace (I know their have been allot of religious wars but allot of peace has also come of religion if you cant see that well then your blind and I\'m sorry) in ways we just couldn\'t in the past so, I though that if maybe it would be nice if we stopped throwing shit at each other for no reason and had a talk about some of the rules that just don\'t work any more" sure you might just get a "FUCK OFF KID" and if you do record it put it on the internet get some karma for it and watch the media eat it up but you might also get something productive out of all this fighting which would be better then more segregation, where large towns become atheist and small ones become Christiana because then things just get worse and worse. \n I don\'t expect you to agree with me here, I know it\'s hard but if we just keep fighting then we will do nothing but make the situation worse. I will go back to me last example the 1950-80 when black people first got real rights not imagine if instead of having MLK telling them to be respectful have him telling them to fight their white oppressors that would have made white people fear and hate them. Now that the situations and we are all traded equal now we can joke, we can have people make jokes and satire but for the time being we have a choose to make; we continue the cycle of hate or, we rise above it and brake it. \n One last point never in the history of the world has a revolution been a good thing. Even your american revolution was in essence a bad thing at first anyway, it was a war to make the rich free and the poor slaves nothing more that\'s why you needed to be a white male landowner to vote back when the deluration was first signed and even then their could have easily been behests and fixings due to the was the system used to work and still does to today. The same goes for almost ever revelation that has ever happened so before you get that idea you can just throw that out.', 'summary': 'fighting it will get us no where as it has shown in the past. Revolutions a joke an should be seen as one in almost ever situation. For so many reasons more then I can ever give to you we need to show we can be better before we can start to poke fun. \n p.s.

Whenever there was a Thunderstorm Shadow would somehow manage to jump over our fence and ran to Nancy\'s house and there would be times were Shadow would "run away" this caused Nan to think we weren\'t treated Shadow right.

Deflation in the original, rational sense of that word as a harmful economic phenomenon and a symptom of depressions, means a *decrease in the supply of money*. This can only happen in a fractional reserve banking system, since when such a bank goes under, checks written upon its reserves loose all value and money is effectively destroyed.\n\nThe increase in the value of money, in contrast, when it is caused by an *increase in the supply of goods*, and not a decrease in the supply of money, is not harmful. In fact, it is a great benefit to everyone in the economy. As long as improves one\'s own productive ability in proportion with the rise in the productivity of the economy as a whole, one\'s position is better off because, while one now earns $5 an hour instead of $10 an hour, this $5 now buys *more* goods than the $10 did, because of the increase in wealth.\n\nNeither is such increase in the value of money (caused by increase in the supply of goods) beneficial to creditors and harmful to debtors. So long as those debtors continue to improve their productivity in proportion with the whole economy (i.e. if 5% more goods are produced, they themselves produce 5% more), the increase in the value of money will be matched by the increase in their wealth. It is only if they lag behind in productive ability that they lag behind in relative wealth, but this is as it should be because it transfers wealth to those who are improving their productive ability at a greater than proportional rate. (Incidentally, this is why farmers in the late 19th century U.S. agitated for inflation—they were debtors who were not keeping up with the economy\'s increases in productivity. Their being put of business is what allowed the country to move from an agrarian to an industrial economy.)\n\nDebtors are only ruined by actual *deflation*—destruction of money—which, as I said, is caused by the failure of banks in a fractional reserve system. In such a situation, without there being any more goods, a $500 debt suddenly takes on a $1000 value, causing more banks to fail and potentially collapsing the whole fractional reserve system driving all debtors to bankruptcy.\n\n(If you want to use the words "deflation" and "inflation" as many people do nowadays, to mean increases and decreases in the value of money, rather than the supply of money, you must then think about "good deflation"—increases in value brought about by increases in the supply of goods—vs. "bad deflation"—increases in value brought about by decreases in the supply of money. This is a conceptual disaster.)\n\nSecond, while there was a significant increase in the supply of gold resulting from such gold rushes, averaged over time it was much less than the inflation rate of the most responsible government today. Since gold is a commodity, it tends to be produced in greater quantities only insofar as everything else is produced in greater quantities, because of improvements in technology, resulting in a stable price. Nevertheless, I admit that this is an advantage Bitcoins have over gold.\n\nThird, while a small number of Bitcoins may be accidentally lost, this rate would be very small if they were used enough to be extremely valuable and would not be a significant source of deflation. As I have already explained, the increase in their value caused by more goods being traded in a Bitcoin economy does not represent deflation. To the extent that it does affect people\'s spending patterns, it encourages saving—the investment of money in enterprises that will return more money than is put in—over consumption—the purchase of goods that do not pay for themselves. The effect of this is to increase the amount of wealth in the economy, which comes from production, not consumption.\n\nFourth, the actual total quantity of Bitcoins or of gold is *irrelevant*. 1 Bitcoin could power an economy of 3 people or 3 quadrillion people. This is because Bitcoins (and gold, through the use of paper/digital currency) can be subdivided indefinitely. (In the case of gold, I suppose, this would technically apply only down to the atomic level.) There is absolutely no need for the money to "grow with its userbase". All that must be done is that people move from trading in denominations of 1 Bitcoin, or 1/10 of one Bitcoin, to denominations of 1/1000 or 1/1,000,000 of one Bitcoin.\n\nOf course, any currency\'s value will *not* be stable during a process of mass adoption or abandonment. If, for example, the U.S. government were to switch to a 100% reserve gold standard, backing all money with gold, its value would increase enormously. The same would happen to Bitcoin if even 1% of the global economy were to use it. But once such a currency finds its market value, prices will stabilize, and with Bitcoin will have a benign tendency to rise with increases in the supply of goods.\n\nTL;DR: Deflation, in its harmful sense, means the destruction of money, and this is not what happens with gold and Bitcoin.', 'normalizedBody': 'First of all, you have a misunderstanding of deflation.

Occam's Razor is a rather large issue. \n >But I am bothered why some are opposed to me saying that I believe a Deity did have a role. No 100% proof either way. \n Because, quite simply, you create far more problems than you solve with such an outlandish proposition. First, why posit such a thing without any evidence whatsoever? Even more, why posit something without any evidence when instead of solving your problem, it  actually makes it far worse? \n You now are left with more questions than you started with. Where did this deity come from? What are its properties? Why does it exist? How can we determine its existence? If we cannot, then why does it make any sense at all hypothesize such an entity? Something that has no measurable effect on anything is the same as something that doesn't exist in every way. \n >My question is why so many are against me having my views when either reasoning carries similar weight. Nobody has proven anything. \n Because if you believe hypothesizing unevidenced and unhelpful solutions that actually highly complicate an issue but solve nothing, predict nothing, and determine nothing can possibly  carry similar weight  then you have much to learn. \n This illogical, unevidenced, unhelpful, contradictory, unexplained, non-predictive, non-measurable, non-specific and rather bizarre idea  cannot  carry any weight  whatsoever  to anybody actually interested in actually knowing.", 'summary': "Because it's balderdash.

For example, I need to feel safe. I can go about fulfilling that need in a lot of different ways, and in a lot of different situations. At home, for example, locking my doors helps me to feel safe. In group sex, for example, one of the strategies that I use to feel safe is wearing a condom. And so on.\n\n4) Crucially, my needs can never conflict with another person\'s needs. Chances are, if I feel like my needs are conflicting with those of another person, it is actually our strategies that conflict. For example, I might want to clean up immediately after sex, and my partner might want to cuddle immediately after sex. Those are both strategies to meet more basic needs, and their immediacy puts them in conflict. But, at a more basic level, I might need to feel physically comfortable in terms of cleanliness. My partner might need to feel connected and reassured. If we put our needs in these more basic terms, we can work together to satisfy them using a number of other strategies. For example, she could join me in the shower, and we could maintain physical closeness while we clean up. I can reassure her verbally, and let her know that physical contact is important to me as well. I can wait for a little while immediately after sex, and focus on maintaing physical closeness until we\'re both in a good place, before I rush off to have a shower. And so on.\n\n5) It is very easy to confuse needs and strategies. And it takes a lot of communication and cooperation to figure out, in any given situation, which is which. Often, we have strong inclinations towards particular strategies, and they start to feel like needs. For example, perhaps my partner has *always* cuddled immediately after sex. Maybe she has even ended relationships because her ex refused to cuddle immediately after sex. She might tell me that she needs this cuddling. She might demand it, suggesting that it is the price of admission for our relationship to continue. For her, this strategy is so effective at fulfilling a specific cluster of needs that she experiences after sex, that she assumes it is the only strategy that could possibly work. It might even end up being true that we cannot find any other strategies that effectively satisfy her needs after sex. But, nonetheless, cuddling is still a strategy and not a need. And it is worth exploring other possible strategies to meet both of our needs, if we identify a conflict stemming from her desire to cuddle and my desire to clean.\n\n***\n\nOK, jealousy. I can\'t speak for the needs that you are expressing when you write that you "have a lot of trouble trying to think about them being physical with someone as passionately as they are with me." But I can speak about my experience feeling jealous along the same lines.\n\nFor me, the thought of my partner being as physically passionate with someone else as they are with me makes me feel worried about a few different things. For one, I worry that my partner finds the other person more attractive and more desirable than they find me. In other words, I need to feel attractive and desirable, and seeing my partner pay attention to another person\'s body instead of mine makes me feel those specific needs in a very pronounced way. So, the question becomes are there strategies that we can use to meet my need to feel desirable at the same time that my partner has sex with someone else? One of the strategies that works really well for me is if my partner makes eye contact with me and talks dirty to me while having sex with the other person. Feeling her eyes connect with mine, even if it\'s just periodically throughout the encounter, and hearing her describe her desire for me really helps to meet my needs to feel attractive, and eases the sense of conflict that arises from her being physically engaged with someone else.\n\nAnother thing that I worry about when I think of my partner being physically passionate with someone else is that I will be excluded or rejected by means of her passionate connection with the other person. Put differently, I need to feel accepted and included. One of the strategies that helps me to meet this need is if my partner physically engages with me while she has sex with the other person. If she reaches out to touch my body, or stimulate me in some way, I feel like she wants me to be part of the encounter as much as or more than she enjoys being with the other person.\n\nTo come full circle, jealousy (for me) is linked to the possibility that my partner might not meet my needs to feel attractive, desirable, accepted, and included during group sex. The fact that I\'m having sex with other people helps to meet those needs, which is part of why group sex is so appealing. But I also need to feel connected, and I worry that my connection with my partner might be put in jeopardy by her feeling connected to someone else. That said, having a frank discussion about needs and worries helps me to feel connected to my partner. So, I find that it is useful to discuss worries, needs and strategies with my partner – not only before the group sex, but after as well... and sometimes even during. I\'ve written this post in really formal terms, for the sake of clarity, but in practice, it doesn\'t have to be clunky.

She might demand it, suggesting that it is the price of admission for our relationship to continue. For her, this strategy is so effective at fulfilling a specific cluster of needs that she experiences after sex, that she assumes it is the only strategy that could possibly work. It might even end up being true that we cannot find any other strategies that effectively satisfy her needs after sex. But, nonetheless, cuddling is still a strategy and not a need. And it is worth exploring other possible strategies to meet both of our needs, if we identify a conflict stemming from her desire to cuddle and my desire to clean. \n \n OK, jealousy. I can\'t speak for the needs that you are expressing when you write that you "have a lot of trouble trying to think about them being physical with someone as passionately as they are with me." But I can speak about my experience feeling jealous along the same lines. \n For me, the thought of my partner being as physically passionate with someone else as they are with me makes me feel worried about a few different things. For one, I worry that my partner finds the other person more attractive and more desirable than they find me. In other words, I need to feel attractive and desirable, and seeing my partner pay attention to another person\'s body instead of mine makes me feel those specific needs in a very pronounced way. So, the question becomes are there strategies that we can use to meet my need to feel desirable at the same time that my partner has sex with someone else? One of the strategies that works really well for me is if my partner makes eye contact with me and talks dirty to me while having sex with the other person. Feeling her eyes connect with mine, even if it\'s just periodically throughout the encounter, and hearing her describe her desire for me really helps to meet my needs to feel attractive, and eases the sense of conflict that arises from her being physically engaged with someone else. \n Another thing that I worry about when I think of my partner being physically passionate with someone else is that I will be excluded or rejected by means of her passionate connection with the other person. Put differently, I need to feel accepted and included. One of the strategies that helps me to meet this need is if my partner physically engages with me while she has sex with the other person. If she reaches out to touch my body, or stimulate me in some way, I feel like she wants me to be part of the encounter as much as or more than she enjoys being with the other person. \n To come full circle, jealousy (for me) is linked to the possibility that my partner might not meet my needs to feel attractive, desirable, accepted, and included during group sex. The fact that I\'m having sex with other people helps to meet those needs, which is part of why group sex is so appealing. But I also need to feel connected, and I worry that my connection with my partner might be put in jeopardy by her feeling connected to someone else. That said, having a frank discussion about needs and worries helps me to feel connected to my partner. So, I find that it is useful to discuss worries, needs and strategies with my partner – not only before the group sex, but after as well... and sometimes even during. I\'ve written this post in really formal terms, for the sake of clarity, but in practice, it doesn\'t have to be clunky. It\'s gotten to the point now where I use dirty talk, at least partially, to suss out what my partner\'s needs are and what strategies we can employ to go about meeting those needs.', 'summary': 'Discuss ways that will help you feel safe, secure, recognized, appreciated, desired, etc. during group sex.

I had actually gone to that school when I was her age.  At the time, classes for me ended about 30 minutes before they ended at her school.  Sometimes, my mom would pick me up, then drive to my sister's school, wait a bit, then pick her up and drive us all home.  Other times, if my mom thought she might run a bit late, she would have me walk over to her school and I'd wait for her/my sis.\n\nThis story takes place on one of the days when I had walked over to my sister's school.  It was a Thursday (this is important for the story).  So I've walked over to my sister's school.  I get there and I have to pee.  As an adult, I understand that adults can't just enter an elementary school to use the bathroom.  You would at the very least have to sign in at the office before they'd let you use their washroom, assuming they would even let you at all.  But, I was in middle school and I didn't know that.  Besides, if you had told me then not to do that, I wouldn't have understood why.  At the time, I was not much older and not much taller then the kids who went there.  There's no way I could be seen as a threat.  So I went inside, and went to the washroom.\n\nAs I'm at the urinal, a kid walks in.  He looks at me for a sec, then goes to one of the stalls.  I finish up, wash my hands and go back outside to wait for my mom.\n\nAt my sister's school, they usually send out any important notices on Fridays.

While my friends were in Target, I was standing outside, smoking a cigarette and generally feeling like a total piece of shit, when out of no where, I hear a load tire screech sound and then the collision of a car accident. I looked to my left just in time to see the black SUV land on it\'s roof after flipping one whole rotation. I ran as fast as I could to the accident, got down next to the driver side door just as a young Asian (race has context later) woman is crawling out of the driver door window and what I assume was her mother or grandmother crawls out of the opposite side. They speak no English, and are hysterical, but though all the commotion, I managed to hear the sound of a small child crying. I dropped to the ground and looked in the vehicle to see two car seats with a baby (prolly about 6 to 8 months old) and a maybe 2 year old, both male. Without hesitation I crawled in, over broken glass and debris, and went for the older boy because he was closest, propped him up as best I could, unbuckled his little car seat (and if you don\'t have children, this is not the ideal situation for trying to figure one of these things out lol) and held him in my one arm as I used the other to crawl out. As I reached the window I entered from, another stranger had come to assist, and I handed him the child. Then, I turned around and went for the other. This time it was a little harder to stay calm because the baby had a cut on his forehead, and I wasn\'t sure how deep it was or if he had any other injuries, but I went about it as best I could and got the little guy out of there the same way. This time upon reaching the window, I held the baby as I crawled out, and a little crowd had gathered, and the emergency services where just arriving.

The older woman, was not so much grateful as much as very concerned with something that was still in the vehicle, as she was yelling and pointing back to it, very clearly trying to get me to go back in. Now, my first thought was, "Oh jesus fucking christ is there another fucking kid?!?!" but as I went back towards the SUV, I could clearly see that no one was in there. When I looked back to the woman, clearly puzzled, she gestured with her pointer finger almost violently, to something in the front seat. I did that thing where you try your best to line of sight figure out what someone is pointing at and low and behold, there it was. A. FUCKING. IPOD. I was beyond pissed, and it wasn\'t even a newer model or anything, but rather one of those big ass bulky original brick looking fuckers.

This time it was a little harder to stay calm because the baby had a cut on his forehead, and I wasn\'t sure how deep it was or if he had any other injuries, but I went about it as best I could and got the little guy out of there the same way. This time upon reaching the window, I held the baby as I crawled out, and a little crowd had gathered, and the emergency services where just arriving. I walked over to where the two women had been standing and handed them the baby. \n The younger woman was very grateful, and was making sure I knew as best she could. The older woman, was not so much grateful as much as very concerned with something that was still in the vehicle, as she was yelling and pointing back to it, very clearly trying to get me to go back in. Now, my first thought was, "Oh jesus fucking christ is there another fucking kid?!?!" but as I went back towards the SUV, I could clearly see that no one was in there. When I looked back to the woman, clearly puzzled, she gestured with her pointer finger almost violently, to something in the front seat. I did that thing where you try your best to line of sight figure out what someone is pointing at and low and behold, there it was. A. FUCKING. IPOD. I was beyond pissed, and it wasn\'t even a newer model or anything, but rather one of those big ass bulky original brick looking fuckers. I wanted to flip out, maybe smack her around for a little bit, but I kept my cool as best I could. I ripped the iPod off the cord, and if you remember the old iPod USB cords, they had little buttons on the side that you needed to press in to release it, so I felt mild satisfaction in knowing I may have slightly damaged what was so dear to this old bitch. \n At this point, I realized my friends had no idea where I was, because I was supposed to be outside Target smoking, and I walked away from the site, found my friends riding around the parking lot in a cab looking for me, and jumped in the front seat, silent. When I got in the cab driver said to me, "Hey man, you got some blood on your face." Apparently, while I was holding the baby, some of the blood from his forehead got on my cheek. It was at this point that I told my two buddies in the back seat, and the cab driver for that matter, what had just transpired. They had a slightly dumbfounded look on, and I knew it sounded strange, but the cab driver was so inspired by the story that he insisted our cab ride was free of charge. And that my friends is the story of the most eventful couple of hours of my life.', 'summary': 'I was an utter shit bag when a man could have needed my assistance, but was as if by the will of the universe given an opportunity to try to redeem myself \n EDIT - Spelling'}{'author': 'Waelsleahta', 'body': 'When I was 4 or 5 in preschool I had an interesting experience in the bathroom.

This is par for the course with Japanese as their society is customarily polite to the extreme by default, yet he comes across humble in his translated words as well. \n I think he has a place in F1, but I look at Maldonado and Perez who were both "pay drivers" but have performed for the most part better in the long term and I can\'t see him as a number one a team would thrown their collective weight behind. \n What I wish continued was his trend to make ballsy passes.  If he was still in your inside mirror at the braking zone, best not cut to the apex as he will still be there.  I wish every driver assumed every driver who took a peek was about to pass.  This whole "I turned into my apex and hit him but I had the corner so it\'s his fault" BS gets old, and Koby called many on it.  Hamilton used to do it, and now he is gun shy since 2011.  We no longer have anyone who passes by default, follows next. \n He reminded many that passes can still be made by forcing your nose in and worrying about the rest later. \n An amazing and well deserved gift was his podium in Japan.  Regardless of how the rest of his racing career goes, that is an awesome accomplishment and one that he can feel comfortable hanging his hat on in case he doesn\'t make it back to F1.', 'summary': 'We need more Kobyashis.'}{'author': 'BattleHall', 'body': '&gt; One thing we haven’t done is change our prices because of this surge in demand.

It\'s good to talk to a lender to get "pre-qualified" (yes, it\'ll niggle your credit), because they\'ll be able to tell you the maximum loan amount your current financial profile could afford. It takes into account debt-to-income ratio, credit history, job standing, etc., so it\'s good to keep your debt as low as you can and don\'t default on payments.

Let\'s make up a new scenario. Say *your* lease was up at the end of February 2014, and you were calculating savings up until January \'14. Divide it out. How much do you need to save to accumulate your down payment on a $200k loan? If you\'re saving 5%, that\'s ten grand you need for a down payment. *Don\'t forget closing costs!* Look at mine; they\'re a couple thousand dollars. So your down payment isn\'t the only money you\'ll have to save. Over-estimate a little. If you\'re trying to save 5% down payment? Try for 8%, just to make sure you cover your bases (more accurate information from a lender). So, 8% of $200k is sixteen thousand dollars.\n\nThere are eleven months between now and January \'14. That means you\'d have to save $1,450 every month to accumulate $16,000 to cover your costs.\n\nThat\'s basically your minimum. If you were to calculate a "best case" scenario, you\'d aim for probably 10% of the loan value: twenty thousand bucks. Between now and January, you\'d have to save $1,800 to make that goal.\n\nThat\'s really it, and really all I did.

I faltered here and there, because I got married in the middle of it, but I kept adjusting the calculations and making sure I was still good.\n\n**TL/DR:** Realistic expectations, careful calculation -- seriously, project it all the way until your intended date of purchase, and try to over-save.\n\nPlanning it is the easy part. *Doing* it takes balls.

Wins aren\'t always solely based on a single teammate, maybe there\'s a teammate that\'s terrible on the team and they get carried through the games consistently, so going by wins isn\'t always the best, but at the same time it could have benefits. Going by kills is another problem because some people in the lower tiers get a ton of kills per game to start and suddenly skyrocket through the tiers, so Kills isn\'t a great way either. K/D isn\'t necessarily a great way to go either, because again in the lower tiers there are those people that boost it. Sure your K/D should level out after a time and set around where your "true skill" lies, but at the beginning it might not be. This will only truly happen after I\'d say about 4-6 months of playing. We\'re getting to that point, but a lot of people like to smurf accounts when their K/D just "isn\'t good enough." The obsession with K/D online makes no sense honestly, everyone wants to have that 2.0... but frankly, if you aren\'t a 2.0 player, you won\'t get that 2.0 in the long run unless you increase your level of skill through practice. K/D is just a number that shows up on your service record and doesn\'t necessarily mean anything especially if you\'re a great objective player. Anyway, I\'m done ranting for now!

He lives in a house share and I live in a flat by myself. We see each other a lot and we date a lot more too. We don't fight as much and we've both had a chance to rediscover who we are outside of the relationship.

I\'m going to post about my experience quitting, and what has worked for me. Feel free to ignore it, but maybe it will help motivate you, and if not, maybe when you do decide it\'s time to be done, you\'ll remember it and it\'ll help you out.\n\nI tried quitting for months. I would not buy any, stay away for a day or two or even three; then I would go to a friends house and have a sesh and end up buying some for myself on the way home. I tried imposing rules on myself like "no smoking before work." It would last a few days until I worked a four-hour shift from 5pm-9pm and I\'d be like "Well there\'s a few hours to go, I\'ll be sober by work," at noon and have a bowl. Eventually I stopped caring about not smoking before work. And I tried weaning myself off. Worked out how much I was going through in a week, then down to the day. For two weeks I let myself have that. Then for two weeks I went down to 3/4 of that. I planned one doing this over and over again until I was only having maybe a bowl a day or skipping the odd day.\n\nThe problem was when I tried to go to the third step, my allotted amount for the day wasn\'t enough to get me high, at least not where I wanted to be. So I stayed at the second step for a few weeks and eventually before I even realized it, I was back to my regular amount.\n\nThe only reason I quit and stuck to it was because my fiancée got pregnant and we didn\'t want smoke around the developing baby. She said it was fine if I did, so long as I did it outside the apartment and followed some basic hygiene things to keep her and the baby protected, but it seemed mean to flaunt this thing I knew she liked in her face while she abstained, so I quit for solidarity. My baby is literally the only reason I don\'t go out and buy some right now. It would be easy. I\'m still friends with my dealer, we hang out sometimes, but he knows I quit and respects it.\n\nMy best advice for you, if you\'re really looking to quit, is decide on the reason. Maybe print it out and hang it up somewhere to remind you, but you have to be able to keep it in your mind. For me it\'s easy, we have doctor\'s appointments all the time and I\'m always reading stuff about what a guy should do during the pregnancy or birth or first week. \n\nFill your days. I mean completely fill. I have a job where I work 10 hour days now and on my off days I make sure to either plan something with the fiancee or hang out with friends out in public all day. It keeps me away from smoking and generally I\'m tired enough when I get home to not need to smoke. If my friends do smoke I stay inside or away from them while they\'re doing it cause I know the smell will tempt me and I know I have weak willpower.\n\nI "quit" at about 1am Jan 1st, 2013. Tossed the bongs and pipes and papers so there was less temptation. Sure papers only cost like a buck but knowing they\'re not at home and I would have to go out and get some first before I could smoke is just another step\'s worth of buffer for me. Plus I\'m not the biggest fan of joints, I prefer a pipe.\n\nI will admit, I *have* had exactly two bowls since then. Both on separate nights, both on the last/second-last day of the month. Fiancée was out of the house for 12 hours doing placement for school and I was at a friend\'s place so I wasn\'t worried about second-hand getting to her. I don\'t try to rationalize it and make it "okay" or anything. I\'m an adult and I made a choice to smoke some, no sense in getting all worked up about it. And there\'s no reason that having one bowl and enjoying it meant having to go and pick up a quarter of my own. I thought of my baby, my reason, and it was enough to not want to have it around the house.\n\nI actually find that while I still enjoyed it for the most part, certain aspects of it bug me now. I tried to tell the story of how I proposed to my friend after half a joint and lost my place three times because I couldn\'t remember what I was going to say next. I had enough memory of being sober recently that when I heard myself talking about what I thought was an interesting observation, I could hear that I was kind of repeating my thoughts, just in different words, over and over again. I\'ve been eating healthier but I bought and ate a large bag of chips, two chocolate bars, a PB&amp;J sandwich, two spicy chicken wraps and a JBC from Wendy\'s. All within like maybe two hours. That shit\'s not normal.\n\nI used to go through a half oz in 4-5 days. At best I was spending $90 per half, at worst $120. And I never cared what the price was, I just wanted what I wanted and I paid what I was told it cost. Middle of the road, I was paying ~$600 per month. (That\'s $7,000 a year!) I\'m not gonna lie to you and tell you I have a bunch of spare cash now, because I suck at saving. I spent my money, but instead of spending on something I burned and inhaled (arguably, something I **loved** to burn and inhale) I\'ve bought half a new wardrobe, taken the fiancée out a handful of times to nice restaurants, can afford a crap-ton of groceries when I get the motivation to do shopping, I bought some dumb bells and added an inch to my biceps, and I\'m sure I\'m missing some things.\n\nAfter boredom, one of the hardest things for me to get over was a lack of appetite. I already told you how I combat the boredom: I fill my days. Even if it\'s with a gaming marathon where I don\'t leave the house all day, it keeps my mind busy and from thinking about having a bowl. Anyway about the appetite: I would smoke almost all day, but I literally never ate without having a bowl first. (For you hyperbole police out there, maybe not literally but if it was anything bigger than a snack.) Without smoking I just wasn\'t as hungry any more. Like to the point people thought I was becoming anorexic. For a couple of days/a week or two I just let myself not eat. Like maybe a single peanut butter sandwich for the whole day. Eventually I started to get hungry again, it was just a psychological condition I had written into my personality and the only cure for it was time.\n\nSorry for going on so long, hope it\'s okay.\n\n**tl;dr:** You won\'t quit until you give yourself a rock-hard reason and remind yourself of it constantly.

Being a yorkie (stubborn eaters), I had been through it and didn\'t cater to his denial for food for 3 days. Then I caved and got him a new brand hoping to get his attention. Then I tried going to the go to what got him eating when I first found him, lunch meat. After a week, I got desperate and got a baby syringe and started feeding him meat based baby foods. \n I was unemployed at the time. It was horrible. I basically just laid with him and died with him. It was 2 or 3 weeks of spending my full days laying with him, trying to force feed him some baby food every 2 to 3 hours, watching him waste away, hoping as hard as I could that he would just eat something on his own again. It got to the point where he would get up and try to walk to his dog house, and would only be able to take a step or 2 before he collapsed. After this back and forth, him trying to get to his dog house, but not being able to make it, me picking him back up and bringing him back to the couch, I tried to feed him again and he immediately threw the food back up. It looked and sounded painful. \n I had been wrestling with the thought, but that was the moment I thought "I need to call the vet". I couldn\'t compose myself enough to make the call, so my wife called a local mobile vet for us. I took him into his backyard, and he had a burst of energy (I think he knew) he hadn\'t had in weeks. Strong enough to walk half the length of the back yard to his favorite spot. He surveyed his yard from his favorite spot, hobbled back over to me, and collapsed on the ground. I picked him up, brought him back inside, and the vet arrived... \n summation in the form of a', 'summary': "If you are close to your dog, you'll be sure when they die. Shut up the paranoid parrot, and just enjoy your pet while you have them. I don't expect anyone to read it or care about it if they do, I just needed to type that out... I'm still not done grieving the loss of my bestest buddie. [I miss you J Dizzle Fo Shizzle.]("}
