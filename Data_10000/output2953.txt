Here's the order I built it in. Your steps may differ depending on the hardware:\n\n1. Lay motherboard out on the box from the packaging. Try not to touch any exposed metal.\n2. Install CPU. Make sure it's seated correctly. You don't want bent pins (which will either be on the motherboard or the CPU). The little lever arm will require a surprising amount of force. \n3. Install the memory. Make sure to read the motherboard manual to see which slots you should use if you're installing only 2 of the 4 slots.\n4. Install the CPU cooler. Check the CPU manual for how to apply the thermal paste. Will likely be either 5 small dots (one in each corner and one in the middle) or 1 large dog (one in the middle). I used a little scraper to spread it out evenly.\n5. Install any M.2 SSD to the motherboard. \n6. Temporarily install the GPU.\n7. Do a dry run to make sure everything works by hooking up the CPU and the GPU to the power supply. Hook up the HDMI cable from the computer to the GPU (not the motherboard). Hook up a mouse and keyboard to the USB slots on the motherboard.\n8. Repeatedly mash the delete button while starting up to enter the bios. Make sure the bios is recognizing all your hardware (CPU, memory, SSD storage).\n9. Power it down and unhook everything from the PSU. Remove the GPU from the motherboard.\n10. Install the PSU in the case by removing the little plate on the case, installing the plate on the PSU with four screws, and sliding the PSU into the case. Screw in using case screws. Assuming the case allows, install the PSU so that the fan sucks up air from the base and into the case.\n11. Set the case on its side and install the motherboard. Make sure the standoff screws in the case are in the same position as the holes in the motherboard. Mine had nine holes and in the case, the center standoff already had a little peg inserted. All I had to do was thread the center hole of the motherboard onto the little peg, and all the other holes lined up.\n12. Hook up the front IO to the motherboard. Hook up the fans to the motherboard.
