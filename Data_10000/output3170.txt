By what mechanism would it choose which questions to ask to facilitate answers to that initial question lacking a preexisting answer in preexisting data? Existing AIs simply lack the motive to even care. Which becomes especially relevant in some of the foopaws people have forced ChatGPT to engage in. Such as giving out information it wasn't supposed to give because it was only explaining what information it wasn't allowed to give, rather than giving the information.\n\nThis is also apparent when you try to solve physics with ChatGPT and gives absurd solutions to mathematical equations. Because it mistook it's own initial output error in interpreting the question as an authoritative answer even after correcting the initial misinterpretation. It mechanically feed that error back into the reinterpretation of the question. All while accusing the user of just being mean to it by insisting that it made a error, that the user was the one in error even though an intelligent 5 year old could see through it.\n\nThere is a whole list of [ChatGPT failures here](https://github.com/giuven95/chatgpt-failures). Such as the [time traveling user](https://i.redd.it/3kru3lr7cuha1.png) error. Why did it insist the user had time traveled? Because when it made the initial error it feed that error into the \"attention\" of the conversation, using matrix addition, as if it was an authoritative fact of the evolving conversation. That matrix is the only actual piece of the conversation it retains for transforming new input from that user. The matrix addition nonlinear, so ChatGPT can't simply unwind such a mistakes and redo the matrix addition with valid information. So, when pressed, it generates the most \"probable\" explanation based on the best fit to the existing matrix at that time that defines the \"true\" state of the conversation as defined by that matrix. The \"attention\" part of ChatGPT, which is the part that makes it so convincingly powerful, is a matrix state that cannot unwind itself and reflect on how it came to that state. There is not, and cannot be, a self correction mechanism using such a mechanism (matrix) to define the state of a conversation.\n\nChatGPT fundamentally can't even evolve it's own state of understanding to correct it's own past mistakes. Much less provide an functional foundation for AGI. A matrix addition, devoid of it's specific inputs, is the totality of facts it can know about the present. The only fix is to reset the conversation itself as if it never occurred. Then maybe, with the right questions input, it'll arrive at a more valid output.

By what mechanism would it choose which questions to ask to facilitate answers to that initial question lacking a preexisting answer in preexisting data? Existing AIs simply lack the motive to even care. Which becomes especially relevant in some of the foopaws people have forced ChatGPT to engage in. Such as giving out information it wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to give because it was only explaining what information it wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to give, rather than giving the information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is also apparent when you try to solve physics with ChatGPT and gives absurd solutions to mathematical equations. Because it mistook it&amp;#39;s own initial output error in interpreting the question as an authoritative answer even after correcting the initial misinterpretation. It mechanically feed that error back into the reinterpretation of the question. All while accusing the user of just being mean to it by insisting that it made a error, that the user was the one in error even though an intelligent 5 year old could see through it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a whole list of &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/giuven95/chatgpt-failures\"&gt;ChatGPT failures here&lt;/a&gt;. Such as the &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/3kru3lr7cuha1.png\"&gt;time traveling user&lt;/a&gt; error. Why did it insist the user had time traveled? Because when it made the initial error it feed that error into the &amp;quot;attention&amp;quot; of the conversation, using matrix addition, as if it was an authoritative fact of the evolving conversation. That matrix is the only actual piece of the conversation it retains for transforming new input from that user. The matrix addition nonlinear, so ChatGPT can&amp;#39;t simply unwind such a mistakes and redo the matrix addition with valid information. So, when pressed, it generates the most &amp;quot;probable&amp;quot; explanation based on the best fit to the existing matrix at that time that defines the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; state of the conversation as defined by that matrix. The &amp;quot;attention&amp;quot; part of ChatGPT, which is the part that makes it so convincingly powerful, is a matrix state that cannot unwind itself and reflect on how it came to that state. There is not, and cannot be, a self correction mechanism using such a mechanism (matrix) to define the state of a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT fundamentally can&amp;#39;t even evolve it&amp;#39;s own state of understanding to correct it&amp;#39;s own past mistakes.
