I know personally I have quite a bit of hashpower for a hobby miner, but nothing on the scale that is coming online, or possibly being purchased by other hobby miners or small mining enterprises. So that leads me to believe there is an actor involved in the scenario, that has swaths of miners literally sitting on standby for someone to turn the on switch the moment DA happens.
