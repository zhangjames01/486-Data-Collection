First, in the Jewish religious tradition, anyone born to a Jewish woman is by default Jewish. Hence the rule in Israel: if you're ethnically Jewish (i.e. born to a Jewish woman), then for quite a while you could get automatic Israeli citizenship if you applied and did military service. (This rule has weakened somewhat due to recent debates in Israel as to who exactly counts as Jewish and heightened evidentiary standards that prevent many people born to Jewish mothers from proving that they are, in fact, Jewish.)\n\nSecond, because the Jewish community is small and was, historically, oppressed, it became very tight-knit. While this has relaxed somewhat in recent decades, especially in the U.S., there is still a strong sense of community among many Jews, especially in the more observant sects. This communal bond expresses itself in part through a shared sense of ethnicity.\n\nFor many Jews, the existence of the State of Israel reaffirms this sense of ethnicity. Israel is an explicitly Jewish state. This differs from many other race-based or region-based identities. There is no state explicitly for Asians, for example. There are many states in Asia, and a plethora of peoples who come from the Asian subcontinent, but no state purports to represent all Asians. A person from China, for example, probably wouldn't look to Japan to set the tone for all Chinese people, let alone to India for the same. Yet all three states are in Asia, and the people who come from all are Asians. Israel is different from this. Israeli leaders, as leaders of the Jewish state, frequently purport to speak for all Jews. World Jewish opinion also has an effect back in Israel. The authority isn't religious, it's ethnic. The Israeli rabbinate does not (and cannot) claim to render final decisions binding on all Jews, at least not more than any other respected rabbinical establishment. But the debates playing out in Israeli politics do tend to affect world Jewry.\n\nFinally, Judaism is unusual among religions. A person really can't just become Jewish at any time, at least not if that person hopes to be recognized as Jewish by Jews who are more religiously observant. Rather, there is a long process that involves significant amounts of study, three separate requests to convert to Judaism on the part of the person seeking conversion (two of which, by tradition, must be rejected), and the taking on of Jewish religious obligations. Judaism is very much a legalistic religion, and it might be hard to become Jewish (at least in the more religious sects) without anyone noticing. You'd have to start keeping Kosher, fasting on certain days, praying several times a day, etc. There's actually quite a bit to do!

First, I would question the study's conclusion that this generation performs more poorly than previous ones on the SAT. Put simply, the SAT has changed quite a bit since 1994. [This Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT) does a good job of tracking the changes. Basically, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. The following quote illustrates that the problem continues throughout the data:\n\n&gt;PIAAC data was analyzed so that trends could be compared to previous adult literacy assessments. In literacy, comparisons are made between PIAAC (2012) and both the Adult Literacy and Life Skills (ALL) survey (2003\u20132008) and the International Adult Literacy Survey (1994\u20131998). In numeracy, trend comparisons are made between PIAAC (2012) and ALL (2003\u20132008). *In both the literacy and numeracy domains, approximately 60 percent of the items are common between PIAAC and previous international surveys to ensure the comparability of these domains.*\n\nIn other words, only a little more than half of the data across time is in apples-to-apples comparisons. This makes it difficult to compare between generations.\n\nSecond, it seems that the authors chose only 3 data points (1994, 2003, and 2012) to use in drawing their conclusions. I can't imagine that it would have been particularly difficult to compare the results of every SAT during this 18-year. It's not like ETS is lacking the data. Why choose only 3 data points to show a trend?\n\nThird, even if we were to accept the trend to be true, there's still the problem of controlling for the groups taking the test. The authors mention quite a few times that Millennials are the generation with the highest levels of educational attainment. In other words, more people are going to college (and hence, taking the SAT) than ever before. More people taking the test means a wider variation in skills and in background. The paper doesn't seem to control for nativity, race, educational background, etc. across generations. Rather, it focuses on these data points as compared across countries.\n\nI would, however, accept the contention that we Millennials perform poorly as compared to people in our age cohort in other countries. This has less to do with a diminishing performance among our generation versus previous generations than it does with the so-called \"rise of the rest.\" Most other first-world countries have chosen to put money into education, to reform their education systems to the benefit of students, and to make it easy to go to, and stay in, college. We have not. Instead, Boomers have consistently chosen to keep those resources for themselves, in the form of lower taxes and lesser public benefits. The very things that Boomers' parents gave to them---resources that those parents sacrificed for the benefit of their children---is the very thing that Boomers, as a group, have not given to us. Do I feel that we were entitled to these resources? Yes. I think that it's a fundamental American value to sacrifice for your children, and one that seems to have been lost in large measure on Boomers as a generation.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate to say it, but this study looks flawed.

In Bangladesh, for example, garment workers make [about $66 per month.](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bangladesh-garment-industry-rana-plaza-wage-hike-524125) Thus, it seems unlikely that Baxter is actually that much cheaper than human labor, which is also much, much more adaptable. Further, in the manufacture of textiles especially, labor is actually a [fairly small percentage](http://www.bizstats.com/reports/cost-of-labor.php) of the cost of goods. To illustrate, one of the reasons that textile labor hasn't returned to the United States isn't because of our labor price disadvantage, but because of the [lack of skilled middle-skilled workers](http://hbr.org/2012/12/who-can-fix-the-middle-skills-gap/ar/1). Thus, even if we take as given that Baxter is cheaper on a per-unit basis when doing simple tasks like making or folding shirts, the slow down in production volume would almost certainly drown out the savings on the labor.\n\n&gt;There isn't a rule of technology that says better technology makes more better jobs for horses. [The same goes for humans.]\n\nTrue, but likely inapplicable to this particular setting. Just because a technology eliminates the need for a certain tool (horses) doesn't mean that it eliminates the need for all tools, or for the workers who wield them. People who held jobs as horse grooms may have lost their jobs after the advent of the automobile, but other jobs that did not previously exist, such as automobile driver or auto mechanic, opened up to take their place.\n\nThe general gist of this documentary seems to be that thinking robots are going to put not only workers in unskilled/semi-skilled labor out of a job, but others as well. But robots are [really bad at doing some pretty basic things](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/21/robotics_pioneer_intelligent_machines_are_scary_for_a_lot_of_people/). Even if they get better at doing things like categorizing objects into groups or working with limited information, it seems doubtful that they will have particularly good judgment or the general adaptability of a human worker. All of which is to say that humans are adaptable in a way that robots are not. While it is true that your next barista may be a robot, this doesn't mean that all human jobs are going to go the way of the carriage horse. The Industrial Revolution made many jobs obsolete or redundant, but, as we can see, this did not lead to widespread economic collapse (or even rigid stratification) in the way that the documentary seems to be hinting at. People are pretty good at filling niches, and when one niche disappears, often another opens to take its place, even if this does not happen immediately, or happen to the exact same person or in the exact same place as the job that was eliminated.\n\n&gt;Discovery in particular is already not a human job in many law firms.\n\nOnce again, the documentary takes a trend and amplifies it to the point where it is no longer true. Discovery (the job of sifting through mountains of evidence, including lots and lots of documents, to figure out exactly what your case looks like) does nowadays involve bots in a way that it never did before. But there is still very much a human element to this type of discovery, precisely because a robot doesn't really know what it has on its hands. A robot can pretty well figure out what emails may be related to what other emails, but it has no damn clue what any of the emails mean.\n\nIn some ways, the example of discovery is the perfect illustration for why this documentary is wrong, and why it is poorly constructed. The documentarian knows that robots are involved in reading documents. He knows that this is different than what happened before, and that, in the tasks at which they work (finding related emails, collating documents, etc.), the robots are much better than the human beings. But the documentary then goes on to imply that human beings are made obsolete in the discovery process, which is simply not true. This is pretty much what this documentary does for every point it makes.\n\nIt's a shame to see an issue of actual social import (how are we going to deal with increasingly effective technology that may displace a lot of workers?) reduced to the equivalent of a man walking around the block with a sign that says, \"The End Is Nigh!\" We need better stuff than this if we're actually going to deal with the social problems of the coming generation, rather than simply wring our hands about them.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to put the tl;dr up front here, because this is going to be long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: A snarky tone and a few examples does not a good point make.
