I had a completely healthy pregnancy, My son was/is completely healthy but he found a position he was comfortable in and refused to move lol. He wasn\u2019t just breach he was completely sideways lol. Doctors told me the only way I could give birth without a C-section is if they manually turned him however it was risky to him and could lead to an emergency C-section anyways. I chose to just go ahead and schedule a C-section instead of trying to force him to turn and cause damage to him. So when people say shit like the post above it\u2019s extremely annoying because it\u2019s like would you rather me have put my baby in danger and myself since the surgery would now have to be an emergency just for a type of birth that people consider \u201cnormal\u201d when in reality there are so many babies that are born via C-section and have been for generations. I don\u2019t need some sort of bragging rights when I still had to go through all of the pains of pregnancy and recovery that took even longer. The most important thing is the health and safety of my child not how I gave birth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course the post is from someone who talks about when they are pregnant and not someone who\u2019s already gone through it.
