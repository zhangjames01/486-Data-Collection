I never realized something was wrong until I was about 8 (something like that) and I began to notice his \"oddities\" (for lack of a better word). I realized that the way he behaved was different than the way that most kids his age and even my age behaved, so I asked my dad and was told that he was autistic. My experience growing up with him was really jealousy because I was always jealous of the relationships my friends had with their siblings. I just couldn't relate to him no matter how much I tried. He was into sports and planes and I was into video games and theatre, and to this day we don't share interests. We were distant from each other and he was very to himself. It also made having my friends over challenging because he would always give me a hard time when I tried to have friends over. He didn't--and still doesn't--like to see them in the house so I always just tell my friends \"Oh my house is small there's no place to put everyone.\" Even when he's at college I still find myself saying that because after so many years of not having people over, I don't even know what to do when they would come over, so I don't even bother. He's high functioning, which I'm thankful for. It's just that social situations challenge him and his comprehension skills are a bit behind others.\nI really can't think of any terrible effects that his asperger's have had on my life. Sometimes I get concerned about him because he gets down on himself for having asperger's. I would say most of the \"terrible\" effects were when I was younger and didn't fully understand having an autistic sibling. Being treated like the older sibling while not being the older sibling kind of put me in limbo (and it still does). The jealousy is something I got over because I learned that we both care deeply about each other, we just show it in different ways than most other sibling pairs do.\nAs for the greatest effects, I've learned quite a bit of patience and tolerance. Because my brother struggles to make friends, I am drawn to people that tend to have very few or no friends. Most people I know would just dismiss them as annoying--and some people with no friends are, and that's WHY they have no friends. But I know that these people can feel very alone and all it takes is one person to reach out to them. It makes them feel like they have someone. Some people also call this behavior of mine \"being fake\" (can you tell I'm still in high school?) but I genuinely care about these people so that isn't the case.\nMy time with him has also taught me to turn a negative experience on its head. I'll never say \"a blessing in disguise\" because that is not something I believe in. I've learned a lot from my brother, but I will never say \"Autism? Yeah that's a blessing.\" A blessing is a gift. Asperger's is not. That being said, I plan on going to college and using engineering to help the mentally and/or physically disabled. I know how challenging growing up with a disabled sibling was, and for that reason I want people in my situation to not have to go through what I have--or at least go through it with more ease.\nAll in all, my brother is great. I really do look up to him. He's hardworking and compassionate. Most of all, he's a great friend and he's always been good to me.\n(Can't condense so no TL;DR sorry)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a brother who is 2 years older than me and has asperger&amp;#39;s.
