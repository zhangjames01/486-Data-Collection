It bothered me. Silence only belonged in a forest where there were no men. I couldn't understand how that young man could manage to hold his tongue.\n\nBut perhaps that was what made him a monster. After all, what man could stay so emotionless while I slew all of his most loyal followers? Their limbs and organs glinted in sunlit pools of blood but he wept not, spoke not. His face remained an empty slate.\n\n\"Self-defense,\" he said, sitting on a gilded throne that made him look like a  prince. He had dark hair and a sharp nose. There was a mischievous but charming air about him, and a kind of boyish innocence I couldn't help but trust despite the monster I saw very plainly bubbling in him. His crisp white military uniform, dotted with red where his followers' blood had splashed, was a facade I wouldn't fall for. Or shouldn't fall for, anyway.\n\nWhat my eyes saw, my mind could not accept. He was trustworthy - this was a fact I knew as plainly as any other. Tried as I might, I couldn't deny it. Every word from his tongue had to be true. He was just in shock about the way I massacred his soldiers - that was why he was so impassive.\n\nI had never in my life met another good human being, but here was one in front of me alive and breathing.\n\nAnd I had just killed his army.\n\n\"Self-defense. No king will damn a man for defending himself against criminals,\" I said. The truth rolled off my tongue. I rarely lied but this time, this time it felt like something coerced the truth right out of me. Like the truth didn't belong to me anymore, but was something I owed him instead. \n\nEveryday I walked out of my castle clad in my armor and saw monsters wearing human skins and walking in broad daylight. Every time I entered a room a fight broke out, and I had to stop it. Most days, I spilled blood to maintain peace.\n\nEverywhere I went, monstrous people lived. I'd moved from village to village trying to find somewhere to call home, somewhere men were truly men, ones who were civilized and pure and honest. Only... each new village I moved to was full of thieves and rapists and whores. Most men attacked me on sight. That was why I called them monsters - those things were no longer human.\n\nThe king awarded me a knighthood and a duchy for all the criminals I had subdued, but yet I couldn't find a place to call home or a family to call my own.\n\nthen this started - I received letters from the king, from wizened men, from good men in far-flung areas of the countries. They all warned me about him. I ignored them and continued to look for a place to call home but then even those monsters started accusing me of being one of Cain's spies and went berserk at the idea that I was related to him somehow. They were afraid of him, so very afraid, and perhaps I was wrong to disregard those warnings. Not even angels should rush in where monsters fear to tread. \n\n\"How prudent of them. I mean, see what an outstanding citizen you've become,\" the boy said. I could have sworn there was mockery in his expression and in his voice, but I supposed he had a right to be upset at the man who just murdered all his loyal followers. I felt a surge of pity, but I couldn't say anything to defend myself. Maybe I was wrong to have killed all these men. He was only a lad; he couldn't have been as terrible as those monsters said he was.\n\nThey tricked me into trying to kill the first good man I would encounter, and I fell for it. I deserved his mockery.\n\n\"You've murdered all my dogs, and now their bitches have twelve pups to feed all on their own.\" He frowned, but did not look particularly displeased with this turn of events. \"Actually, I ought to thank you for that. I've less mouths to feed now.\n\n\"How many villages have you destroyed?\" He stood up and smiled at me, a sweet smile that was cruel and kind all at once.\n\n\"None. I saved them all from the criminals running them.\" Even as I said them, I heard my heart pound. *Guilt*, a voice in my head whispered. *You're guilty...and he knows it. You thought you were an angel but in reality he's the angel who's come to pass judgment on the sinner.* \n\nNo. \n\n\"No.\" Even as I said it, I heard the weakness in my voice and the crack in my defense. I couldn't bring myself to believe the words coming out of my mouth. \"I saved them all from the criminals. I saved them from the monsters pretending to be people. Once I slew everyone, I could leave the town and the people, real people, would come back to -\"\n\nHe laughed. \"And how many people remained in those villages after you cleansed them?\" He shook with laughter, his frail frame quivering beneath his grand clothes. \"I wanted for a hero to come and slay me. I waited for someone with ideals, someone who would tell me that sacrificing loyal peasants in my selfish wars was wrong. Someone to tell me that soldiers who would die for me aren't fools, that I should appreciate how much love everyone gives to me, but then they send you to me. And when you came and I saw ayou, I thought...I thought salvation had come. I wanted to die. No, I want to die. I am not a man who deserves to live, not after everything I caused. But how many people remained in those villages after you cleansed them? Answer me.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes and looked up, his words ringing harsh and hollow in the hall. I did the same. On the ceiling, paintings of angels and gods stared back down at us.\n\n\"None,\" I whispered. \"The men will come back after a while.\"\n\nThe gods judged me.\n\n\"And how many men have you seen, Abel?\"\n\nMy eyes welled up with tears. \"None save myself.\" The words came out as a whisper, and I realized I had passed my own judgment.\n\nHe stood up from his throne and walked towards me, sword drawn. \n\nI dropped my own with a clatter. The blood rippled in the sunlight, and I fell to my knees. \n\nWhat did a real man look like? Perhaps those monsters I murdered...could they have been men? Was I the monster then? It made no sense; they advocated wanton brutality. I...all I ever wanted was peace.\n\nHe brought his sword to my neck and let it graze a slight wound there. I closed my eyes.\n\n\"If those were men I murdered, then do me a -\" I began. He backhanded me with the hilt of his sword.\n\nWas this how the men I murdered felt?\n\n\"I could kill you, but for some sick reason I can't bring myself to. I can't let you become a martyr, dying in an attempt to save the country from a usurper. No, that'd make everything too difficult for me. Or maybe I should let you kill me. You would turn into a hero...imagine that, you, a murderer, being turned into a hero... No.\" He sheathed his sword. \"This country needs a hero, Abel, and as much as it would amuse me for you, a murderer and a madman, to become the kingdom's greatest hero, I'm simply too selfish for that. I'd like to be the ruler of so many more realms before that, so thank your gods that I'm a little more selfish than I am needlessly malicious.\"\n\n\"No, please -\" I did not deserve to live. I have killed countless men and destroyed all their villages. The king made a mistake knighting me. But he was right, if he killed me I might become a martyr. There was no winning here. He was right. I opened my mouth to speak, but it was dry. \n\n\"Remember this: you are the country's greatest mass murderer. It is all you are and all you ever were. I will leave, and when a worthy hero comes I will hand his life to you on a platter, so that you can turn him into a monster and murder him as well. This kingdom thinks you are a hero, but we both know you are only a monster, and I thank you for that. Truly, I do.\"\n\nHe kicked me in the gut, and I let him. I bit my lip, doubled over, but made no sound. I didn't deserve to make a sound. And I lay on the floor listening to him leave the hall, leave the castle, leave me.\n\n*I am a murderer I am a murderer I am a murderer I am a murderer I killed people those were people I killed I am not a man I was the monster all along I thought I murdered thieves rapists assassins murderers but I was only destroying these villages I killed them I killed them I killed them -*\n\n After I heard the last of his footsteps fade away, the guilt faded away, and I realized that those were not men I killed at all. They were monsters, each and every one of them, and all the monsters I had killed, all the monsters who asked me for help, every single one of them was right.\n\nI picked myself up off the floor, my mantra changing slowly but surely.\n\n*I saved innocents. I rescued those villages I entered. They were overrun by criminals when I arrived, but when I left everything was quiet again. Peaceful again. Nobody lived there anymore, but that was okay. All the good men had just gone into hiding. And so what if I only ran into monsters? I had never seen the gods, yet I knew they exist. And the same goes - I may have never seen good men, but they existed. And I cleared out villages for them to live in again. I was the hero. That was why I was a duke now, because I was a hero.*\n\nCain was wrong. I was not a murderer, but he was right on one part - a worthy hero would come to slay him one day. And one day, he'd realize that worthy hero he spoke about was me.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The empty throne room was pregnant with silence.

His face remained an empty slate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Self-defense,&amp;quot; he said, sitting on a gilded throne that made him look like a  prince. He had dark hair and a sharp nose. There was a mischievous but charming air about him, and a kind of boyish innocence I couldn&amp;#39;t help but trust despite the monster I saw very plainly bubbling in him. His crisp white military uniform, dotted with red where his followers&amp;#39; blood had splashed, was a facade I wouldn&amp;#39;t fall for. Or shouldn&amp;#39;t fall for, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What my eyes saw, my mind could not accept. He was trustworthy - this was a fact I knew as plainly as any other. Tried as I might, I couldn&amp;#39;t deny it. Every word from his tongue had to be true. He was just in shock about the way I massacred his soldiers - that was why he was so impassive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had never in my life met another good human being, but here was one in front of me alive and breathing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I had just killed his army.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Self-defense. No king will damn a man for defending himself against criminals,&amp;quot; I said. The truth rolled off my tongue. I rarely lied but this time, this time it felt like something coerced the truth right out of me. Like the truth didn&amp;#39;t belong to me anymore, but was something I owed him instead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday I walked out of my castle clad in my armor and saw monsters wearing human skins and walking in broad daylight. Every time I entered a room a fight broke out, and I had to stop it. Most days, I spilled blood to maintain peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everywhere I went, monstrous people lived. I&amp;#39;d moved from village to village trying to find somewhere to call home, somewhere men were truly men, ones who were civilized and pure and honest. Only... each new village I moved to was full of thieves and rapists and whores. Most men attacked me on sight. That was why I called them monsters - those things were no longer human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The king awarded me a knighthood and a duchy for all the criminals I had subdued, but yet I couldn&amp;#39;t find a place to call home or a family to call my own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then this started - I received letters from the king, from wizened men, from good men in far-flung areas of the countries. They all warned me about him. I ignored them and continued to look for a place to call home but then even those monsters started accusing me of being one of Cain&amp;#39;s spies and went berserk at the idea that I was related to him somehow. They were afraid of him, so very afraid, and perhaps I was wrong to disregard those warnings. Not even angels should rush in where monsters fear to tread. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How prudent of them. I mean, see what an outstanding citizen you&amp;#39;ve become,&amp;quot; the boy said. I could have sworn there was mockery in his expression and in his voice, but I supposed he had a right to be upset at the man who just murdered all his loyal followers. I felt a surge of pity, but I couldn&amp;#39;t say anything to defend myself. Maybe I was wrong to have killed all these men. He was only a lad; he couldn&amp;#39;t have been as terrible as those monsters said he was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They tricked me into trying to kill the first good man I would encounter, and I fell for it. I deserved his mockery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve murdered all my dogs, and now their bitches have twelve pups to feed all on their own.&amp;quot; He frowned, but did not look particularly displeased with this turn of events. &amp;quot;Actually, I ought to thank you for that. I&amp;#39;ve less mouths to feed now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How many villages have you destroyed?&amp;quot; He stood up and smiled at me, a sweet smile that was cruel and kind all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;None. I saved them all from the criminals running them.&amp;quot; Even as I said them, I heard my heart pound. &lt;em&gt;Guilt&lt;/em&gt;, a voice in my head whispered. &lt;em&gt;You&amp;#39;re guilty...and he knows it. You thought you were an angel but in reality he&amp;#39;s the angel who&amp;#39;s come to pass judgment on the sinner.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; Even as I said it, I heard the weakness in my voice and the crack in my defense. I couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to believe the words coming out of my mouth. &amp;quot;I saved them all from the criminals. I saved them from the monsters pretending to be people. Once I slew everyone, I could leave the town and the people, real people, would come back to -&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He laughed. &amp;quot;And how many people remained in those villages after you cleansed them?&amp;quot; He shook with laughter, his frail frame quivering beneath his grand clothes. &amp;quot;I wanted for a hero to come and slay me. I waited for someone with ideals, someone who would tell me that sacrificing loyal peasants in my selfish wars was wrong. Someone to tell me that soldiers who would die for me aren&amp;#39;t fools, that I should appreciate how much love everyone gives to me, but then they send you to me. And when you came and I saw ayou, I thought...I thought salvation had come. I wanted to die. No, I want to die. I am not a man who deserves to live, not after everything I caused. But how many people remained in those villages after you cleansed them? Answer me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He closed his eyes and looked up, his words ringing harsh and hollow in the hall. I did the same. On the ceiling, paintings of angels and gods stared back down at us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;None,&amp;quot; I whispered. &amp;quot;The men will come back after a while.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The gods judged me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And how many men have you seen, Abel?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes welled up with tears. &amp;quot;None save myself.&amp;quot; The words came out as a whisper, and I realized I had passed my own judgment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stood up from his throne and walked towards me, sword drawn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dropped my own with a clatter. The blood rippled in the sunlight, and I fell to my knees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What did a real man look like? Perhaps those monsters I murdered...could they have been men? Was I the monster then? It made no sense; they advocated wanton brutality. I...all I ever wanted was peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He brought his sword to my neck and let it graze a slight wound there. I closed my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If those were men I murdered, then do me a -&amp;quot; I began. He backhanded me with the hilt of his sword.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was this how the men I murdered felt?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I could kill you, but for some sick reason I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to. I can&amp;#39;t let you become a martyr, dying in an attempt to save the country from a usurper. No, that&amp;#39;d make everything too difficult for me. Or maybe I should let you kill me. You would turn into a hero...imagine that, you, a murderer, being turned into a hero... No.&amp;quot; He sheathed his sword. &amp;quot;This country needs a hero, Abel, and as much as it would amuse me for you, a murderer and a madman, to become the kingdom&amp;#39;s greatest hero, I&amp;#39;m simply too selfish for that. I&amp;#39;d like to be the ruler of so many more realms before that, so thank your gods that I&amp;#39;m a little more selfish than I am needlessly malicious.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, please -&amp;quot; I did not deserve to live. I have killed countless men and destroyed all their villages. The king made a mistake knighting me. But he was right, if he killed me I might become a martyr. There was no winning here. He was right. I opened my mouth to speak, but it was dry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Remember this: you are the country&amp;#39;s greatest mass murderer. It is all you are and all you ever were. I will leave, and when a worthy hero comes I will hand his life to you on a platter, so that you can turn him into a monster and murder him as well. This kingdom thinks you are a hero, but we both know you are only a monster, and I thank you for that. Truly, I do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kicked me in the gut, and I let him. I bit my lip, doubled over, but made no sound. I didn&amp;#39;t deserve to make a sound. And I lay on the floor listening to him leave the hall, leave the castle, leave me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a murderer I am a murderer I am a murderer I am a murderer I killed people those were people I killed I am not a man I was the monster all along I thought I murdered thieves rapists assassins murderers but I was only destroying these villages I killed them I killed them I killed them -&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I heard the last of his footsteps fade away, the guilt faded away, and I realized that those were not men I killed at all. They were monsters, each and every one of them, and all the monsters I had killed, all the monsters who asked me for help, every single one of them was right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked myself up off the floor, my mantra changing slowly but surely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I saved innocents. I rescued those villages I entered. They were overrun by criminals when I arrived, but when I left everything was quiet again. Peaceful again. Nobody lived there anymore, but that was okay. All the good men had just gone into hiding. And so what if I only ran into monsters? I had never seen the gods, yet I knew they exist. And the same goes - I may have never seen good men, but they existed. And I cleared out villages for them to live in again. I was the hero. That was why I was a duke now, because I was a hero.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cain was wrong. I was not a murderer, but he was right on one part - a worthy hero would come to slay him one day. And one day, he&amp;#39;d realize that worthy hero he spoke about was me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4nfou2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4nfou2/wp_the_heros_superpower_is_the_ability_to_bring/d43om9h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4nfou2/wp_the_heros_superpower_is_the_ability_to_bring/", "name": "t1_d43om9h", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1465570309.0, "created_utc": 1465570309.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4nfou2/wp_the_heros_superpower_is_the_ability_to_bring/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2z15u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[1400] Jad", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DestructiveReaders", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ct3z3g7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "kirianthine", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3dbinl", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_9zn4s", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hi!

In a way that's good because it means that your voice doesn't distract the reader from the story and doesn't get overbearing at any point in the story. It's rather pleasant, to be honest. \n\nFor writing style, your problem is that you have a lot of characters debating this one thing and so you always feel compelled to use \"said\". Said is an invisible word, so they say, but in your piece I actually noticed it because you used it a lot of times. You could try replacing some of them with actions, but I'm not sure this would work either.

The mark of good writing, I feel, is the author's ability to pull in the reader and make him or her invest emotions into the character and events in the story. At no point in your story did either occur for me. I just felt kind of bored and meh, and at the end I still felt bored and meh. I'll try and break down the reasons for this. \n\nLet's start at the beginning. The first sentence showed a hint of a promise, but the super long laundry list that followed it crushed any hopes I had for the story. I get it; you were trying to establish a rhythm. However, those things are really tricky to get right and even when they're done right, they can't last too long or else they just get repetitive and annoying. I said it in the doc but I feel like it just needs to be said again: the repeated use of \"would\" hindered the prose because it just slowed down the sentence and added nothing. Plus the whole thing became a super long laundry list really quickly. She did this, she did that. I have no idea who Isabelle actually is as a character.\n\nThat brings me to my second point: character. I can't invest in your character because she's a blank slate. There is literally nothing about her personality in 95% of that story. She's a robot doing one thing after another, as far as I'm concerned. She doesn't like anything, has no little habits, no quirks, no face - none. She doesn't even have any thoughts for me to latch on to and relate with. Characters, especially POV characters, are pretty important because they're who the reader has to spend the entire story with. Would you like to spend an entire story with some robotic stranger? No? I didn't think so. Try adding some thoughts in there, at least. You don't have to describe her, but hints of her personality earlier on would help your story and make it easier for the reader to sympathize.\n\nSpeaking of describing, I feel like you really left the world bare. Any description you had was told, not shown. I can't see a world if you don't give me any hints. The reader is basically like a person who has severe myopia, and you, as the writer, are his pair of glasses. You aren't going to describe every itty bitty thing for the reader, but you need going to help him see the world for what it is, and allow him to make his own conclusions.\n\nAs for the ending, I feel like it was a let down. Maybe it's just me, but all throughout the piece I felt like there was this smug \"I know something you don't\" vibe that often comes with stories like these, but then it turns out the reveal came from nowhere and wasn't all that...interesting (sorry to say). x.x More hints are needed, and even then, I'm not invested enough in the character to really care that her father is dead. Maybe if you showed more of the relationship between the father and daughter it might have turned out to be a better ending.\n\nYour prose is easy to read (so that's a good thing), but it is too bare. It's skeletal. I know this is flash fiction, and maybe that's why you left out so many details. However, I feel like flash fiction is in some ways more difficult than novel writing in that respect. You only have so few words to work with, so make each one count. Every sentence has to either show the reader something new in terms of characterization or plot or worldbuilding, otherwise it needs to be thrown out. It's not a hard and fast rule, but it is a good rule of thumb. If you follow it, you'll notice that majority of your story needs reworking. Characterization need not take up an entire scene on its own, and neither does worldbuilding. You could do both in one sentence, like:\n\n\"Isabelle examined the scratch on her hand, wondering if it was deep enough that she should worry about having cut it on rusty metal.\"\n\n..or something like that. You get the gist. Anyway, I hope this helped! In the end, it's your story so you should make the final call. These are my thoughts though, and I strongly suggest focusing on the characterization so that your story holds more sway with the reader's emotions.\n\n-Kiri", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiya! :D I left comments and suggestions on the doc, but I&amp;#39;m going to give you a rundown of my personal feelings here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like short stories, but this one doesn&amp;#39;t work for me.

I asked a question a while back and everyone has been really helpful, but something came up. \n\nIt turns out that I can't find a reliable and affordable seller for an Olympus EM10 where I live. At first I thought I found one, but the seller told me he only sells it on an order basis and if ever it came with defects, it wasn't returnable nor would they service it. The only reseller that does offer a warranty is selling it for twice as much as a Sony A6000 or Nikon D5500 and that's way over my budget. The same applies to other micro four-thirds systems.\n\nIn light of this, I would like to ask for advice again. I have reconsidered my needs and I was dead set on getting an A6000 but then a lot of people basically scared me off by saying how terrible the lens on the Sony is and that I should go with a Fuji X-E1 instead. At first this seems like sound advice but I can't get over the lack of a grip in the Fuji (I was able to handle all three cameras listed here). So here are my questions:\n\n1. Is the lack of a grip something I'll ever get used to or should I just spring for the Sony/D5500, which feel perfect in my hands, despite the terrible lens system/weight? \n\n2. The Fuji kit lens blows the A6000's out of the water (apparently). Will this make a huge difference and should it outweigh the grip issue?\n\n3. At this rate, is the D5500 simply the most viable choice out of the three? It feels nice in my hands but is admittedly slightly heavy and bulkier than the other two.\n\nI'm more confused than ever. :( Sorry for bothering you guys again, and thanks for reading. If it matters, all three are almost exactly the same price. Also, I plan on travelling maybe twice or thrice a year with the camera of my choice.\n\nETA: I am most interested in street photography.
