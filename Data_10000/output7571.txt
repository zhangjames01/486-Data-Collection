Text files are just files with text characters in them. If you look up an ascii table, they'll mostly have just the letters from that table in them - in binary format.

A sequence of characters so you know what the file is. So do video files and spreadhseets and archives / zips etc.\n\nA binary file is generally a file that's just a program. It has a header that marks it as a program of a type, and then the rest of it is 1's and 0's to make up machine code.\n\nSometimes, rarely, when you download a file it's a binary like that, and then you can just run it directly. Golang does this. Only do that with trusted sources though (it could also just be a malicious program). But then you likely have to put it in the right place to run, and might need to add other libaries or configurations, and might have to set up things to get it to work.\n\nSometimes, we use a package manager like rpm / yum. RPM packages are a way of putting a bunch of files into one file, building metadata into that package so your computer knows where to put those files, building metadata in so the computer knows what checksums and permissions and timestamps those files should have, scripts to run installing / removing / upgrading / etc that package, and finally signing everything. Yum is a script / system to automatically download those packages, check the signature, then do the things outlined by the package. Basically, a RPM package puts the binaries and configs and libaries that you need into one file, and then your computer automatically puts everything in the right spot when installed.\n\nSource files are just the source code that makes up the program. Generally, you write a program by writing a text file with the code you want, then running a compiler (a binary program, like gcc) and giving your text file as the argument, and that compiler makes a binary file or a library or similar, depending on what your code was (if everything goes well). Most source code (since like the 1970's-ish) includes a \"Makefile\" or similar, which is like a recipe for how you compile that program - instead of running a bunch of commands to make each binary file by hand, you can run one make command to make everything.\n\nSo then, there's usually packaging scripts that take that source mysql git repository or tarball or zip file, unpack it, run an RPM build spec file, which runs the makefile in a safe location, then packs up the things that makefile made into a package, adds in scripts and other stuff. They then get one package file, they usually sign it, put it into a repository, then you can download it and use it.\n\n---\n\nWhen you're using one server, generally you want to just use the package from your repositories - someone else that has more experience built it or built the CI that built it, and there's likely tests involved to make sure it works properly. And other people are running it. If you have a problem, other people probably have found the same problem, and then someone's possibly already working on a fix. If you compile it yourself, nobody else is running it and the only way it gets tested is if you test it.\n\nThe big advantage to compiling your own binary is you can control exactly what commits go into the source code that starts the chain. Or you can change it to fix something if needed. So some larger companies that really need that database to work a specific way (probably mostly trading firms) will compile it themselves to get a specific build. But they're likely not using it.
