I can\u2019t say how the performance of the bike in a mechanical set up would be since mine is di2, but I did have some issues running the rear derailleur cable through the chainstay because of some leftover molding material. \n\nHonestly, I do think this bike is a more comfortable ride compared to my SuperSix and definitely a lot more comfortable than my old Edmonda ALR.
