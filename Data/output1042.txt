The shipping was pretty fast (I&amp;#39;m in Canada, they are UK based) and their clothing seems to be of decent quality. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t comment on length of shirts (I&amp;#39;m short and order mostly bras/dresses) but they do have models walking with their clothing on in the majority of the descriptions. I believe the model sizes/heights are listed as well. This may help you determine appropriate length.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also have a sister site, BadRhino for plus sized men (although I find it to be more pricey).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4mzo67", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PlusSize/comments/4mzo67/anyone_bought_from_yours_clothing/d3zp5dy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlusSize/comments/4mzo67/anyone_bought_from_yours_clothing/", "name": "t1_d3zp5dy", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PlusSize", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1465320861.0, "created_utc": 1465320861.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PlusSize/comments/4mzo67/anyone_bought_from_yours_clothing/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbe", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What \"cheap\" products are actually much higher quality than their much more expensive options?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Frugal", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d3okbcq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "crysanna", "num_comments": 1948, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d3ohjn3", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4qmjb", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I was black Friday shopping 3 years ago in the US and I bought every bottle of Suave Naturals Strawberry I could find.
