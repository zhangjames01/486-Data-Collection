The differences are only in appearance, it's like a person with curly hair versus straight hair. In general, you can't predict anything else about a person based soley on whether their hair is curly or straight, or what size ears they have. Dumbo ears are cute, and Rex fuzziness is cute too, but there aren't really pros or cons to either of these traits compared with the standard traits. Hairlessness in rats is usually caused by having two copies of the Rex gene (whereas having one copy causes the curly/fluffy hair, and zero copies causes the regular straight hair). People say that dumbo eared rats are sweeter in temperament, but I haven't found that to be true at all, and I think it's just because they're so cute that people want to believe it.\n\nAs ColonelMolerat mentioned, double-Rex/hairless rats can be prone to some health difficulties. I haven't experienced anything with mine except for some mild dry skin, but I've read about chronic eye infections and various other problems they can have. Hairless rats are also reputed to make bad mothers. It's best to have at least one rat that is not hairless to keep the other one(s) warmer, because a hairless rat on its own has a hard time staying warm enough in the winter.\n\nThe differences between males and females are only generalizations, there's every chance you'll get a rat of one gender that fits the description of the other gender better. But males tend to be lazier and more willing to cuddle and get scritches, tend to mark more, and are maybe slightly more likely to have trouble getting along. (Sidenote on that: If you get two or more rats that are littermates, and have been together their whole life, it's very unlikely they will develop problems getting along with each other, no matter which gender. Males tend to have a harder time being introduced to other rats in the future than females.) Females tend to be more active and energetic, and tend to be worse about chewing things up in my experience, but they're usually a bit easier to litter train because they have less love of peeing all over everything all the time.\n\nSince you have one older male currently, it's probably going to be tough to introduce him to any other adult males. Usually if you introduce an older male to male babies around 4-5 weeks old, and keep them interacting every day, then the older male will accept the babies. When they are that young they are not producing sex hormones yet, so the older male doesn't perceive them as a threat to his social status like he probably would with an adult male. If he's already accepted them by the time that they start producing those hormones, things should continue to go smoothly.\n\nAnother option is adopting female rats who are already spayed, or getting them spayed when you get them.
