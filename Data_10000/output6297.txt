As much as I love Kid A, it has a very different, electronic feel that alienated many fans on its release. Perhaps this is not quite as much the case as it was at the time, as many of its more experimental aspects have influenced so much music from the past 15 years. But it is still in the more \u2018out there\u2019 half of their discography.\n\nI would suggest In Rainbows as the next logical step after OK Computer. It was written and recorded in more of a traditional manner, and some of the songs, like Nude and Reckoner, had been kicking around as demos since the OK Computer era, so they have a similar feel. There's even a theory these albums were written to be heard together, because if you alternate tracks from each (i.e. Airbag &gt; 15 Step &gt; Paranoid Android, etc), they flow together extremely well. Look up [the 0110 album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAos89cuSgQ) for more info. The band have said that In Rainbows will likely be the last of their more \u2018straightforward\u2019 guitar rock, and while that\u2019s unfortunate, at least they left that era on a very high note. \n\nAfter that, I would say it is time for Kid A &amp; Amnesiac. These albums were arranged from the same sessions, and are definite companion pieces IMO. Where Kid A is weird and uncertain about the new era ahead, it has its more upbeat moments in the midst of it all. Amnesiac is just cold and bleak and alienating (and I mean that in the best way possible). You will find no lyrics here about being optimistic, or everything being in its right place. For a good example of this, there is one song from Kid A that was reworked for Amnesiac (Morning Bell). [The Kid A version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAwGWptsOls), despite its lyrics about cutting the kids in half, ends on a more upbeat note. There is no light at the end of the tunnel on [the Amnesiac version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPQfiH78XaE).  \n\nFrom there, you could go in one of two directions. If you are more drawn to the guitar sounds of OKC, The Bends is simply beautiful. I saw them close out their set in Atlanta a few years ago with Street Spirit (Fade Out), and it was a gorgeous, gripping close to the night - one of my favourite concert memories of all time. Hail to the Thief is another guitar-based classic. It is a very political album, which dates it somewhat, but most of the tracks hold up. This is a few songs and about 10-15 minutes longer than their typical output, which the band has sometimes lamented. Thom wrote a blog a few years ago outlining his preferred tracklisting, which takes away some of the dragging factor. It\u2019s not that the songs that were cut are bad - in fact, A Punchup at a Wedding is one of my favourites from the whole album - but they slow down the flow of the album significantly. They had to rush-release it after some demos and unmastered tracks leaked early, and I think if they\u2019d had just a little more time to be more judicious, it would be a much more beloved album than it is. *[the alternate track list, for the curious: There There (The Boney King of Nowhere) &gt; The Gloaming &gt; Sail to the Moon &gt; Sit Down. Stand Up. &gt; Go to Sleep (Little Man Being Erased) &gt; Where I End and You Begin &gt; Scatterbrain &gt; 2+2=5 &gt; Myxomatosis &gt; A Wolf at the Door].*\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is The King Of Limbs, which is far more electronic, and is built around these deconstructed samples. It polarised a lot of fans, much as Kid A did upon its release, but I think it is one of the most brilliant pieces of work they\u2019ve ever created. More than any other record, it really feels like one whole, complete piece of work, and not just a collection of songs. Whereas Hail to the Thief was a guitar-based album that included a few less worthy cuts, TKOL relies heavily on sampling, while leaving off several amazing tracks as B-sides. [TKOL: Live from the Basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DvM4GObIN4) has the tracklisting TKOL should have had - but hey, maybe that would have detracted from the \u2018one complete piece' feel of the album. I think in time, this album will be \u201cre-discovered\u201d by a new generation of bands and recognised as the groundbreaking piece of art it is.  \n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s Pablo Honey. The album definitely has its moments, and I think it is better than the band give it credit for, but it isn\u2019t really the Radiohead we\u2019ve all come to know and love. I consider their weakest effort, and that\u2019s not an uncommon opinion. It is still worth a listen, but it doesn\u2019t really draw me back time and again as their other releases do. \n\nTo recap: OK Computer &gt; In Rainbows &gt; Kid A &gt; Amnesiac &gt; The Bends &gt; Hail to the Thief &gt; The King of Limbs &gt; Pablo Honey.
