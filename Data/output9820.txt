Nominally it may look that way but functionally it isn't. Tuition is an expense whose value is set by the university (the employer), and waiving that internal transaction is not the same as handing us a check or making an in-kind payment such as healthcare. What's more, *universities like Purdue want it this way* for tax purposes. [Graduate tuition waivers are not considered taxable income by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/qualified-tuition-reduction), and if they were then Purdue would have to pay the employer portion of those taxes. Please understand that this is one example of a very common tactic Purdue takes with its graduate assistants: vacillating between considering them students and considering them employees, depending on what's most advantageous for the school.\n\n- Next, this quote really troubled me:\n\n&gt; The benefits we get from students, postdocs, and other collaborators are why we spend an inordinate amount of time writing proposals which have a 10-20% chance of being funded, so that we can actually support our students for their contributions.\n\nYou also write grants because it's an explicit expectation of your job, because it advances your career, and because both you and the university (through the cut it takes from your grant proceeds) monetarily benefit from grant acquisitions. While I don't have numbers, I imagine that the value of those proceeds regularly exceeds any graduate assistantships funded through said grants. I would further love to know exactly how valuable the benefits provided by graduate research on these projects are. Does it exceed the stipend? If so, then graduate RAs aren't just \"collaborating\" or contributing to faculty research, they're also subsidizing it.\n\n(As an aside: can I ask a question? If graduate stipends rose, would that mean that you'd have to allocate that much more money from your own research funding to pay your RAs? I honestly don't know, but if so: does that represent a conflict of interest in this discussion?)\n\n- Third, you acknowledge that graduate students deserve a living wage, but do current stipends meet that level? MIT's living wage calculator, for example, lists the basic living wage for [Tippecanoe County](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/18157) (1 adult, no kids) at $13.65. That's for the county, and West Lafayette itself would be, if anything, higher. Add a child into the mix (anecdotally, I knew parent colleagues relying on food stamps and Medicaid while in grad school) and the living wage climbs quickly. In this context, GROW's asking wage seems pretty reasonable for the specialized labor that grad assistants bring to Purdue's classrooms and labs. \n\nNow, those wage levels are assuming full time work (40 hours), and that's a fair rebuttal. But also consider that every department I've ever heard about discourages or outright bans graduate students taking any other jobs while holding an assistantship. Many fellowships/grants stipulate the same, and the graduate student would risk losing that funding if they took another job. Also consider that international students are usually barred from outside employment by their visas (I knew international STEM students whose only legal income was their .25 FTE assistantship, like $600/month). In sum, can graduate students make an actual living wage when restricted to part time hours at a wage that's already below the \"living wage\" level?\n\n- Finally, you suggest throughout this thread that the university and its faculty, generally speaking, put themselves out for the sake of graduate students by, as you say, waiving significant tuition expenses, by teaching time-consuming classes, and by chasing grants to fund RAs. The implication here is that sacrifices are being made on grad students' behalf that need to be taken into account when suggesting a pay raise. Let me ask in response: why, then, does the university consistently admit far more graduate students than it needs and that many discipline-specific job markets can bear? The answer is simple: because the faculty and university gain far more from graduate student labor than it invests. The benefits are monetary: they cost less than researchers and additional faculty (and we're not even discussing the many unfunded grad students whose tuition payments shore up programs and keep competition for assistantships fierce). They are also professional: faculty accomplish more, reduce their teaching responsibilities, and gain prestige with the help of graduate student labor. Graduate work is absolutely critical to the stability of Purdue's operating model as it currently stands, and this discussion is not nearly as one-sided as you've written thus far.\n\nGROW (which I'm not affiliated with and hadn't heard about before this post) is not even proposing to upset this paradigm. It is asking for a frankly modest pay raise that would almost certainly leave the balance of value between them and the university squarely in the university's favor.", "edited": 1644936814.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former grad student (graduated 2018), I&amp;#39;m going to push back on some of your points here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuition waivers should not be considered compensation for this discussion. Nominally it may look that way but functionally it isn&amp;#39;t. Tuition is an expense whose value is set by the university (the employer), and waiving that internal transaction is not the same as handing us a check or making an in-kind payment such as healthcare. What&amp;#39;s more, &lt;em&gt;universities like Purdue want it this way&lt;/em&gt; for tax purposes. &lt;a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/qualified-tuition-reduction\"&gt;Graduate tuition waivers are not considered taxable income by the IRS&lt;/a&gt;, and if they were then Purdue would have to pay the employer portion of those taxes. Please understand that this is one example of a very common tactic Purdue takes with its graduate assistants: vacillating between considering them students and considering them employees, depending on what&amp;#39;s most advantageous for the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, this quote really troubled me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The benefits we get from students, postdocs, and other collaborators are why we spend an inordinate amount of time writing proposals which have a 10-20% chance of being funded, so that we can actually support our students for their contributions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also write grants because it&amp;#39;s an explicit expectation of your job, because it advances your career, and because both you and the university (through the cut it takes from your grant proceeds) monetarily benefit from grant acquisitions. While I don&amp;#39;t have numbers, I imagine that the value of those proceeds regularly exceeds any graduate assistantships funded through said grants. I would further love to know exactly how valuable the benefits provided by graduate research on these projects are. Does it exceed the stipend? If so, then graduate RAs aren&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;collaborating&amp;quot; or contributing to faculty research, they&amp;#39;re also subsidizing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(As an aside: can I ask a question? If graduate stipends rose, would that mean that you&amp;#39;d have to allocate that much more money from your own research funding to pay your RAs? I honestly don&amp;#39;t know, but if so: does that represent a conflict of interest in this discussion?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Third, you acknowledge that graduate students deserve a living wage, but do current stipends meet that level? MIT&amp;#39;s living wage calculator, for example, lists the basic living wage for &lt;a href=\"https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/18157\"&gt;Tippecanoe County&lt;/a&gt; (1 adult, no kids) at $13.65. That&amp;#39;s for the county, and West Lafayette itself would be, if anything, higher. Add a child into the mix (anecdotally, I knew parent colleagues relying on food stamps and Medicaid while in grad school) and the living wage climbs quickly. In this context, GROW&amp;#39;s asking wage seems pretty reasonable for the specialized labor that grad assistants bring to Purdue&amp;#39;s classrooms and labs. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, those wage levels are assuming full time work (40 hours), and that&amp;#39;s a fair rebuttal. But also consider that every department I&amp;#39;ve ever heard about discourages or outright bans graduate students taking any other jobs while holding an assistantship. Many fellowships/grants stipulate the same, and the graduate student would risk losing that funding if they took another job. Also consider that international students are usually barred from outside employment by their visas (I knew international STEM students whose only legal income was their .25 FTE assistantship, like $600/month). In sum, can graduate students make an actual living wage when restricted to part time hours at a wage that&amp;#39;s already below the &amp;quot;living wage&amp;quot; level?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Finally, you suggest throughout this thread that the university and its faculty, generally speaking, put themselves out for the sake of graduate students by, as you say, waiving significant tuition expenses, by teaching time-consuming classes, and by chasing grants to fund RAs. The implication here is that sacrifices are being made on grad students&amp;#39; behalf that need to be taken into account when suggesting a pay raise. Let me ask in response: why, then, does the university consistently admit far more graduate students than it needs and that many discipline-specific job markets can bear?

Per research by William Rorabaugh, Americans age 15+ around 1830 drank about 7 gallons of pure alcohol (as in, if you extracted the literal alcohol from the booze and added it all up) per capita per year. That's about 3.5 times what Americans consume per capita today, so yeah, that's a lot. An estimated 4.3 of those 7 gallons was consumed via distilled liquor (mostly whiskey by then but sometimes rum), plus another 2.7 via cider. Wine and beer were minor drinks then, lucky to get 0.1 gallons apiece.\n\nAmericans were drinking a ton, no doubt about it, but let's qualify before we get further: alcoholics skew the stats. Both then and today, the top 10% of drinkers consume much more than 10% of the total consumed alcohol. In turn, some adults don't drink at all. Unfortunately I don't have hard numbers for those proportions in 1830, but the point stands that not everyone drank equally.\n\nThese numbers were so high because whiskey and cider were incredibly available, incredibly cheap, incredibly alcoholic (cider was typically around 7-8%, though families occasionally refined it into an \"apple jack\" that was closer to 20%), and in part because Americans were drawing on English and Dutch drinking traditions that hadn't been built booze that strong. Americans drank at mealtimes, during work breaks, and right before bed, and the drinks kept getting stronger and stronger. Distilled liquors had steadily gained popularity since the early 1700s when the triangle slave trade brought cheap molasses up from the Caribbean. Over time it was displaced by whiskey made with cheap corn from western farms. Cider developed as cheap homemade product on farms: apple trees growing alongside farm fields and roads could provide multiple barrels per family per year without taking space from other crops. Tea was more expensive than both of these. Milk was harder to come by, plus growing children needed it more. Public water sources were often unhealthy at this point, and even when they weren't they were still perceived as unhealthy.\n\nHow did the US compare? It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst either. Around 1840 the US was consuming about 1.6x the alcohol per capita compared to the UK and Prussia, but Sweden was consuming about twice as much as the US, while France consumed 2.5x as much. If anyone knows why France was drinking so much, I'd love to know too!\n\nDid American society just shrug this off? The (many) drinkers certainly did, but others didn't! There were two main drivers of opposition to alcohol: class (capitalism) and morality. Elites and employers didn't much care for drunk workers/publics, and moral reformers tended to believe they were saving the nation from itself (naturally, I'm generalizing for space here). Temperance societies formed in the 1810s and soon had millions of members, and elites had been enacting laws governing who could drink, when, how, and how much since the earliest foundation of the colonies.

The temperance movement (plus economic and cultural shifts in the nation that facilitated a preference for beer) mitigated these levels of drinking long before that. By 1840 the US was down to 3 gallons of alcohol per capita (age 15+), and by 1845 it was down to 2.
