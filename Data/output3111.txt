From what you're describing, it could well be ADHD. There are other things that could explain it as well, and you should check with your doctor because some of them can be kind of serious - but if this is a pattern you've had all your life, my money would be on ADHD.\n\nBeing smart, introverted, and female meant that nobody saw my struggles (which were a lot like yours) for what they were until I was 32 years old. Changing majors eleven times in university should have been a clue...\n\nSee if your school's guidance counselors can help; you could also talk to your doctor (pretend you have some embarrasing question if that's what it takes to get an appointment on your own). \n\nEven if you get stonewalled for a while, there are some things you can do on your own that are pretty well always helpful: \n\n1) Exercise more. Things that require balance and concentration, and get your heart rate up, are best - but it really doesn't matter exactly what you do as long as you are enjoying it. For me it's cycling. My friend loves to run. It's all good.\n\n2) Take a look at your eating habits and sleeping patterns. This one's hard because if you're a teenager you're going to have some built-in wonkiness there. In general though, if you can cut back on sugar, caffeine, and processed food, you'll probably gain a bit of alertness. Simple, fresh, healthy food is your friend. \n\n3) Turn off the TV and computer an hour before bedtime and go do something else for a bit to wind down. I like jigsaw puzzles, or drawing. The main thing is to get away from the super-stimulus of the screens. You're probably more sensitive to that than you think. \n\n4) Go easy on yourself. I've never met a truly lazy person who thinks they're lazy. I doubt you're the first :)\n\n\nGood luck!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry that your mom isn&amp;#39;t hearing you. From what you&amp;#39;re describing, it could well be ADHD. There are other things that could explain it as well, and you should check with your doctor because some of them can be kind of serious - but if this is a pattern you&amp;#39;ve had all your life, my money would be on ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being smart, introverted, and female meant that nobody saw my struggles (which were a lot like yours) for what they were until I was 32 years old. Changing majors eleven times in university should have been a clue...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See if your school&amp;#39;s guidance counselors can help; you could also talk to your doctor (pretend you have some embarrasing question if that&amp;#39;s what it takes to get an appointment on your own). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you get stonewalled for a while, there are some things you can do on your own that are pretty well always helpful: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Exercise more. Things that require balance and concentration, and get your heart rate up, are best - but it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter exactly what you do as long as you are enjoying it. For me it&amp;#39;s cycling. My friend loves to run. It&amp;#39;s all good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Take a look at your eating habits and sleeping patterns. This one&amp;#39;s hard because if you&amp;#39;re a teenager you&amp;#39;re going to have some built-in wonkiness there. In general though, if you can cut back on sugar, caffeine, and processed food, you&amp;#39;ll probably gain a bit of alertness. Simple, fresh, healthy food is your friend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Turn off the TV and computer an hour before bedtime and go do something else for a bit to wind down. I like jigsaw puzzles, or drawing. The main thing is to get away from the super-stimulus of the screens. You&amp;#39;re probably more sensitive to that than you think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Go easy on yourself. I&amp;#39;ve never met a truly lazy person who thinks they&amp;#39;re lazy.
