I think the longest I've ever looked for work is maybe a bit over a month and that was with me being a bit choosy.

I get up at regular work times Monday through Friday and search 6-8h a day, minimum.\n* Submitting resumes &amp; applications. Alternate every other day between in person and online. For me 5-12 resumes/applications in person a day is reasonable and 6-25 online a day is reasonable. One day on monster, linkedin, craigslist. etc. and the next day just walking into every single business in a shopping center or going to specific locations around town (enough to take up a full working day).\n* Creating personalized cover letters for *every single job*. I don't care if it is as a busser at a restaurant, I'm bringing in a cover letter and resume. It matters.\n* Always ask for a manager/owner (many times you'll be declined, that is OK), shake their hand, look in their eyes, introduce yourself, ask if they are hiring, if they are not ask if you may leave your resume with them to keep on file in case that changes. Always say please and thank you. \n* Learn how to write a proper and well made resume, cover letter, and most importantly, how to interview well. It matters.\n* Dress nice. Just like with resume/cover letter, dress nice, I don't care if you're going for a busser position, DRESS TO IMPRESS. It matters.\n\nIf you aren't doing these things, if you aren't treating looking for a job as a full time job (assuming you don't currently have a job obviously, if you do have a job this is much more difficult and requires a lot more personal sacrifice), then in my opinion, you aren't really trying. I see these posts on here all the time with people looking for work, saying they can't find work, but then when you dig they are hardly putting in any effort. No shit you aren't going to find a job if you aren't looking. Try going to a city that is actually cutthroat when looking for work and you could be talking about submitting 150+ resumes before you even get a call back, none-the-less an interview. Put in the time and it'll pay off. If it isn't paying off then look into other aspects, the way you're writing your cover letter, the way your resume is presented, are you limiting your options beyond anything reasonable, what are you wearing to interviews, how are you carrying yourself/see yourself, etc. The short and kinda rude response here is, it isn't Bakersfield, it is you. Try harder or change something.\n\nIf you aren't sure about your resume or how you write cover letters, I'll offer to look them over for you and offer advice send me a PM.", "edited": 1534395823.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never had issue finding work in Bakersfield.
