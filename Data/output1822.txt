You assume things to be so because they make sense *to you*.\n\nCasual relationships can differ wildly in scope and connection, from people who like each other but don't want to be romantically involved all the way to the so-called \"one night stand\" where you don't necessarily even know the other person's name. It's not objectification in the sense that you're trying to pass it off as - I've never reduced a partner to her beneficial parts or seen them as something less than human, just because we choose not to pursue a deeper romantic/emotional connection. That's still a person, after all, not just a \"hole.\"\n\nI don't/didn't \"suppress attachment\" in those kinds of relationships, and for the rare situation where I wanted more and they didn't, I learned to walk away because it wasn't right for me, rather than suppress something just to get some lesser version, \"friendzoning\" myself in the weird hope that someday she might change her mind.
