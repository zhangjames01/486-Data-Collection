It was more focused. On what? Its stated purpose, being a support group for people raised by parents who abused them in a particular way. That's still its purpose, but in the last two years, the number of subscribers has grown. In the last six months, the number of subscribers has *exploded*. With that accelerated growth, the subreddit has changed. It has grown from more than merely a \"community\" in name to a community in fact. That change has brought with it a dramatic shift in the way the subscribers interact. Long timers build relationships.  We have come to know one another by the stories we have shared, and we feel as if we know each other. We care, and are curious how each others' situations are progressing. With the increase in what could be called a more social side of the community, there have been more posts taking a relaxed tone. I agree with others who call that progress for the community members who have grown to that point.\n\nWhere the trouble lies is not in those lighthearted posts being shared at all, but with the increased number of posts by people who are not in crisis soaking up the finite amount of attention available within our community. Even with ~60k subscribers, the pool of attention available to go around is limited. What's happening now is there posts which do not fare well in the popularity contest which is ingrained in how reddit as a whole (not just this community) functions. Prior to the growth in what I will call community-oriented (or at least not in crisis) posts, the in-crisis posts received the support they needed. Currently? Not nearly as much as they used to.\n\nShouldn't that concern us? The number of subscribers to this subreddit is exploding, yet the amount of actual support our most vulnerable members are receiving is decreasing. More subscribers. Less support. I am not going to entertain accusations by anyone (not directed at you, /u/nobeansprouts) who wants to say that the mods are trying to determine who needs more support. The fact is that when someone makes a post here quite literally sharing the suicide plan (not intent, actual plan), and *no one* comments, and virtually *no one* upvotes it so it can be seen, that's a problem. And it's not just about the suicidal posters. It's anyone looking for support and not getting it because they can't or won't play to win reddit's popularity contest.\n\nThat's the crux of the issue we're discussing. Not one user. Not a group of users. This discussion is not a witch hunt. We're trying to determine how to overcome the challenges presented by our growth so we can continue to provide the support people come here looking for. Being able to give that to our members is why we have succeeded thus far. We don't want to lose track of that.
