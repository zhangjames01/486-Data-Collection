First off, I don't play Monster Hunter of any kind myself, but Valstrax isn't the Daughter of Khyber. The one shown in the video isn't even close to her. Tiamat is.

You can definitely run into that dragon in human form in the games, perhaps the druid will see that dragon and somehow recognize it from her dreams.\n\nAnyways, onto some game ideas:\n\n- The Snitch idea from Harry Potter works wonders, but I'd make it more challenging than just a snitch. This isn't the wizarding world, this is Eberron. Instead, make it a set of 5 crystals held by Quicklings. The Quicklings zoom around the map. 2 need to be claimed and returned to a weight sensitive chalice. The quickling start out far away and will use their dash actions to zoom around on a map. You party will have to slow them down or stop them somehow. Maybe by turning the ground into difficult terrain? Or casting slow on them as they zoom by? Or locking in some moving walls? I'd have occasionally shifting terrain. As a trick, Perhaps there are 6 Quicklings but 5 crystals, one of the crystals is a fake. When they run past each other, they toss them back and forth. If a player gets in between them, they can make an acrobatics check to catch it. They can also try to steal it from someone else, but in the struggle, the Quicklings might run by in case it drops from their hand, pick it up, and run off again.\n\n- (credit to u/SkritzTwoFace)A maze level that keeps shifting its sections every once in a while. The maze has multiple levels but no clear way up. Perhaps jump spells, teleportation spells or ropes can get them to climb up. The trick is that the exit can only be found while you are on a moving piece of the maze. Imagine the maze having its sections like a rubik's cube, and once every so often, a random section rotates. Perhaps a target can be seen while the sections move, which will cause a door to partially open for every crystal hit (a total of 4 to get the door enough to open through). Of course, if someone knows the doors are being unlocked, they might just end up waiting at the door while it opens, making them to the first to leave the maze and winning the trial. If a Droaamish minotaur is in the trial, that one's going to be the favorite to win it.\n\n- Each side gets a controllable Warforged Titan and they need to destroy the other ones controlled by other teams. They can either attack other titans or go around the map picking up temorary boosts, like temp hit points, attack rolls buffs, damage buffs, fire ball spell scrolls, cannons, shields, saving throw buffs etc. Maybe the party need one person to control the titan directly and the other ones need to keep it up with bufss and heals while taking others down.\n\nHow to decide on a villain:\n\n- Lord of Blades. Personally not a fan of it, because this isn't going to accomplish anything the LoBster really wants. Why would Aundair negotiate with terrorists? If anything, this will encite violence against warforged in the city, who probably won't feel convinced to join someone who kills innocent people. Have the Lord of Blades play into the Trials. A group of Warforged, who are all LoBster loyalists, qualify and enter the Trials. They are spying and spreading propaganda. If they win, they will take the time in their speech that they are here as emissaries of the Lord of Blades and deliver a speech about how warforged should abandon the people who treat them as citizens and join them in the Mournlands, free from prejudice etc etc. Then you have a dramatic escape, destruction of the trophy etc. But the point would be that the warforged _aren't violent lunatics_. That could be a story worth investigating by the bard, maybe.\n\n- Sabotage during one of the games. Keep in mind, this is a time after almost a century of war. I'd say that this is a form of entertainment, though not without the tension between nations. To sabotage the equivalent of the olympic games seems really, _really_ spiteful and straight up evil, something indeed up the alley of the order of the Emerald Claw. But with all the connections the party has, none of them are connected to Lady Illmarrow or her order. You've gotten fiends and the Lord of Blades to set up so far, and those are good things to lean into. Why does a smuggler's group feel the need to kill a dozen people by letting them fall to their deaths? And the anti-magic cone has a 150 foot range, seems a bit small for a field with the size needed for this. How does this ruin the Queen's reputation? She can't possibly be personally held accountable for someone else ruining this event. \n\nThere also isn't one direct line of connection from one character to another. A spore druid with visions of the Draconic Prophecy that end with the Daughter of Khyber rising in a continent on the other side of a planet. A tiefling rogue of unknown origin who smuggles things and might end up in Sharn. And a bard who doesn't have their own identity yet but sees potential in their companions.\n\nFirst thing I'd do is tell the bard that if they don't lock down a background, you'll do it for them. If they don't bite the hooks, they need to be okay with either going along with the other two or let you know what they really want with their character.\n\nThat said, the presence of demonic influence with the other two characters seems like something to unite them. One of the things that comes to mind is that in Kanon, a rakshasa is masquerading \nas a House Orien agent and 'getting comfortable in the safe space' (wink wink nudge nudge) of Jorlanna D'Cannith, one of the 3 House Cannith enclaves. Jorlanna is one of the three possible enheritors of the entire house. One of the other enclave is headed by Merrix Junior, based in Sharn. It might that due to that connection, the rogue can get an introduction. The last heir is Zorlan D'Cannith, who getting very familiar with the Blood of Vol and possibly the Emeral Claw. \n\nThe rakshasa may be meddling in the affairs of the D'Canniths and is using the games to play his hand. The Aundarian team might end up employing a warlock of the fiend, and perhaps that warlock can try to fight or kill one of the party members. If they investigate, they might trace it back to Jorlanna D'Cannith, who may have been set up by that raskhasa. If this would result in the downfall of Jorlanna, it would please Merrix Junior and Zorlan. That could be the rogue's way into Sharn. But perhaps the druid sees the rakshasa escape in disguise, but the disguise is what the druid saw in her dream. A dream in which she saw the real devil underneath. If they chase, they can try to expose the rakshasa and blame it (and provide evidence to get Jorlana freed for blame), or leave the blame on Jorlana so that the rogue can get her way into Sharn with favor of Merrix Junior.\n\nThat rakshasa can come back later in the campaign, meddling with the party yet again. \n\nOne other thing to do, as a prelude to the Daughter of Khyber, is that a dragon is participating in the Trials, while in humanoid disguise. Is this dragon a Chamber agent, a Talons of Tiamat agent, or neither and they're just doing it for the thrills? Maybe if the party accomplishes something cool, they catch the attention of this dragon, with all sorts of consequences attached to that.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright then.

The high, echoing halls made of solid marble seemed to reverberate the soft drag of brustled hair across the stone. The sun shone through the colored glass lining the top of the walls, displaying the scenery of the Fall and Resurrection of Man. The way it all came to be, from beginning to end, as written in the Word of the Wanderer.\n\nRichard liked the quiet. The peace. The silence. Yes, there was a time for chanting, for communion, for prayer. The sense of belonging, together with the good people of this world who simply wanted exactly that, has no real rival amongst the many emotions given to them, alongside their freedom, so long ago.\n\nBut Richard appreciated the silence more than others. It left his mind quiet to think, to reflect, to look back and ponder what could be, what is and what will be. So many people are so busy with filling their lives with noise and distractions, afraid of what their minds can come up with when not filled external impulses.\n\nBut he understood. People are often scared. The scars of the Pains of the Past are still quite clear for all to see. The cooled pits of the Abyss, from which demons crawled out from by the thousands, less then two hundred years ago. You couldn't drive for ten miles through a piece of countryside to encounter an old remnant. Aforementioned pits, the petrified remains of demons tall enough to touch the clouds, the whispers of the damned on the winds in certain valleys, the structures built to support the demons, nearly crumbled to ash.\n\nRichard was almost done with sweeping the church by now. He slid the last bit of dust and dirt into a small bin. As he put the broom into a holder built into the bin, he sat down on the front row of the lined seats. In the fifteen years he'd served here, the sight of the stained glass never stopped amazing him. The immaculate detail with which people made this in times when they shouldn't have been able to. To Richard, it represented the dedication to memory, to humanity and its will to continue, despite the circumstances. Tenacity. Willpower. Spite, maybe. The second-to-last panel always left him wondering, though. A flaw in the piece. The eyes of the Martyr, sometimes, when the sun shines right, appear red.\n\nHe called it out to his brother, who insists that Richard's eyes are failing with age. And that was true. But a young boy, Theresa's son, says he sees it too. The paradox always bothered Richard. Why give the Martyr demonic eyes, and why so rarely?\n\nIn the image, the Martyr departs the Realms of Man. Waving, smiling, asking to be remembered for their deeds. The next panel shows them dissipating to the Realms Beyond, symbolizing how they left us behind in a better way than when they found us. In the final image, the founding of our Church.\n\nThe main door of the church creaks slightly. Father Richard turns around as it closes as well. An unkempt man, small of stature, dressed in a winter coat, shoddy pants and worn sneakers came walking towards him. His hunched shoulders and hands in his pockets as he marched straight towards the holy man sent goosebumps up his spine.\n\nThe man stopped next to Richard, looking at him, then looking up and around the church's glass frames that surrounds them. Father Richard then noticed that the man had left a trail of dirt from the door, throughout the hallway. The shoddy man followed his view.\n\n\"Ah. Sorry, Father. Looks like no matter how much dirt you aim to sweep under the rug, it always comes back, one way or another.\"\n\n\"Our sermon is tomorrow, come back then.\" Father Richard said with a humph as he hauled his old body up from the bench and took his broom.\n\n\"Oh, come now. I'm not unreasonable. Let me clean that up for you. You look like you've had a long day. Please?\"\n\nRichard didn't feel comfortable in the presence of this _intruder_. Something about this man shook him. His eyes were sharp and clear, not fogged with substances as Richard might have expected. His smile was there, covered in a black, unkempt beard. There was something very tense about his look.\n\nThe shoddy man held out his hand, expectantly. Gently, Father Richards handed him the broom, not taking his eyes off of him. Without averting his gaze, the man took it.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nHe tapped his shoes on the tiles, shaking off the dust and soot from his coat. Father Richards wondered if this man was some sort of chimney worker. Turning away from Richard, the shoddy man started swiping up the dirt, whistling a slow whooping tune of sorts. It rang through the church with occasional tunes that caused Richard's earpiece to spike. But within minutes, the man had left no trace of his entry.\n\nAs the shoddy man returned the broom, he asked \"May I sit, Father?\"\n\n\"Well, who would I be to refuse?\"\n\n\"One of many.\"\n\n\"Eh, you may sit.\"\n\n\"You remind me of an old friend of mine.\" The shoddy man said as he opened up his jacket. The man smelled of a hard day's work in poor conditions. The smile never left his face. \"I met her long ago. She'd just had a boy with red hair.\"\n\n\"Oh, goodness.\"\n\n\"I know. Her husband had asked her to leave the little one in the forest. She didn't want to. When I found her like that, she asked for every God under the moon, the sun and the stars to save him. To do something. The way she clutched onto him, it's almost as if she put her soul into him and never wanted to let go. She waited. And then she left him, walking away. Crying, and yet she did.\"\n\nFather side-eyed the man. He'd heard this story before.\n\n\"As she walked, I asked her three questions. The first was, why. She told me that the boy was cursed. The demons would find one touched by Hellfire, which he was because of the red hair. Obviously. I asked her why again, and she told me because she had sinned in her past and deserved punishment, and that giving birth to and loving a child whose soul was tainted beyond salvation must be that punishment. I asked her why, again.\"\n\n\"But this time she refused to answer.\"\n\n\"I suppose they got that part right.\"\n\nFather Richard pointed up at the first pane of glass, detailing the very events that the shoddy man described.\n\n\"If you're going to tell a tall tale like this one, good man, then maybe try a more original one.\" Richards replied.\n\n\"How can it be less original than coming from the mouth of the one who was there?\"\n\n\"You couldn't have been there.\" Richards wasn't sure if this man was stable or sane. He felt cornered, on edge. As if this man was going to do something bad. The shoddy man smiled, but the smile never reached his eyes. Or did it? He appeared entertained, yes, but there was something sinister behind those eyes. \n\nThe man turned to the pane that always bothered Richard and stood up.\n\n\"You've seen it, haven't you? The truth. Few do.\"\n\n\"The truth?\"\n\n\"Playing games, really? Somehow, I expected better from you. From all of you, in fact. I did what no one expected me to do. I went through the Abyss and back, literally. I have seen madness in its purest form. Monsters that are the reason you all fear the dark. Filth that'd leave you swiping dirt off this church floor for the rest of your short little life.\"\n\nThe pane's eyes were red. The sun was just right. But there was something different this time. As Father Richard turned to the rest of the panes, all of the Martyr's eyes turned red in them. Father Richard stood up, in awe of what he saw. How could this be? What's causing this?\n\n\"I am a creature of Spite, Father. People tell me I can't do something and then I find a way to do it. My friend, the mother of the Prophet, told me then and there that I couldn't possibly understand what it means to protect something that was once part of you, that you love so deeply that seperating from it is like tearing one's heart out of their chest.\"\n\nAnd the man took off his jacket, lifted his shirt and showed a bleeding, gored hole in his chest where his heart should be.\n\nFather Richard stood up and scrambled away, pulling out a holy symbol and praying. The man's eyes turned red as his blood was spilled on the church floor.\n\n\"I gave her my heart that day. And she kept it, for all this time. I let her keep it. And keep it, she did. I asked in return that she spread word of how I changed the world for her. Showed her everything can change, with the will to act. And look what she did. She knew she couldn't sell _me_ to the masses. She got greedy. Needy. The power I gave her corrupted her. I shouldn't be surprised, really. But now, this has gone on for long enough. Now, I'm here to take back what's mine. My heart. My worship. The world.\"\n\n\"You cannot lie here, this is a holy place!\"\n\n\"This place is _built_ on lies. Lies you spread, even though you knew the truth. It's why remind me of her, Father. You could have known better, but you never dared to tread past your selfish desires of peace and contentment. Spreading the deceit my kind was condemned for, fearing that which has no real hold on you and letting systems of power rule you and your beloved masses. The Abyss has its demon, true. But if you look deep down inside the praying people, you'll find things worse than your greatest fears Greed. Envy. Wrath. You give in to it and get a free pass. I go against my nature to aid you to prove that I could, and I get condemned and denied. Your Earth is a Hell too, and the humans are its demons.\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father Richard loved to take the time on saturday&amp;#39;s to sweep the floor of the Church of the Martyr.

People are often scared. The scars of the Pains of the Past are still quite clear for all to see. The cooled pits of the Abyss, from which demons crawled out from by the thousands, less then two hundred years ago. You couldn&amp;#39;t drive for ten miles through a piece of countryside to encounter an old remnant. Aforementioned pits, the petrified remains of demons tall enough to touch the clouds, the whispers of the damned on the winds in certain valleys, the structures built to support the demons, nearly crumbled to ash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Richard was almost done with sweeping the church by now. He slid the last bit of dust and dirt into a small bin. As he put the broom into a holder built into the bin, he sat down on the front row of the lined seats. In the fifteen years he&amp;#39;d served here, the sight of the stained glass never stopped amazing him. The immaculate detail with which people made this in times when they shouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to. To Richard, it represented the dedication to memory, to humanity and its will to continue, despite the circumstances. Tenacity. Willpower. Spite, maybe. The second-to-last panel always left him wondering, though. A flaw in the piece. The eyes of the Martyr, sometimes, when the sun shines right, appear red.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He called it out to his brother, who insists that Richard&amp;#39;s eyes are failing with age. And that was true. But a young boy, Theresa&amp;#39;s son, says he sees it too. The paradox always bothered Richard. Why give the Martyr demonic eyes, and why so rarely?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the image, the Martyr departs the Realms of Man. Waving, smiling, asking to be remembered for their deeds. The next panel shows them dissipating to the Realms Beyond, symbolizing how they left us behind in a better way than when they found us. In the final image, the founding of our Church.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main door of the church creaks slightly. Father Richard turns around as it closes as well. An unkempt man, small of stature, dressed in a winter coat, shoddy pants and worn sneakers came walking towards him. His hunched shoulders and hands in his pockets as he marched straight towards the holy man sent goosebumps up his spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man stopped next to Richard, looking at him, then looking up and around the church&amp;#39;s glass frames that surrounds them. Father Richard then noticed that the man had left a trail of dirt from the door, throughout the hallway. The shoddy man followed his view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah. Sorry, Father. Looks like no matter how much dirt you aim to sweep under the rug, it always comes back, one way or another.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our sermon is tomorrow, come back then.&amp;quot; Father Richard said with a humph as he hauled his old body up from the bench and took his broom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, come now. I&amp;#39;m not unreasonable. Let me clean that up for you. You look like you&amp;#39;ve had a long day. Please?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Richard didn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable in the presence of this &lt;em&gt;intruder&lt;/em&gt;. Something about this man shook him. His eyes were sharp and clear, not fogged with substances as Richard might have expected. His smile was there, covered in a black, unkempt beard. There was something very tense about his look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shoddy man held out his hand, expectantly. Gently, Father Richards handed him the broom, not taking his eyes off of him. Without averting his gaze, the man took it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tapped his shoes on the tiles, shaking off the dust and soot from his coat. Father Richards wondered if this man was some sort of chimney worker. Turning away from Richard, the shoddy man started swiping up the dirt, whistling a slow whooping tune of sorts. It rang through the church with occasional tunes that caused Richard&amp;#39;s earpiece to spike. But within minutes, the man had left no trace of his entry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the shoddy man returned the broom, he asked &amp;quot;May I sit, Father?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, who would I be to refuse?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One of many.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Eh, you may sit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You remind me of an old friend of mine.&amp;quot; The shoddy man said as he opened up his jacket. The man smelled of a hard day&amp;#39;s work in poor conditions. The smile never left his face. &amp;quot;I met her long ago. She&amp;#39;d just had a boy with red hair.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, goodness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know. Her husband had asked her to leave the little one in the forest. She didn&amp;#39;t want to. When I found her like that, she asked for every God under the moon, the sun and the stars to save him. To do something. The way she clutched onto him, it&amp;#39;s almost as if she put her soul into him and never wanted to let go. She waited. And then she left him, walking away. Crying, and yet she did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Father side-eyed the man. He&amp;#39;d heard this story before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As she walked, I asked her three questions. The first was, why. She told me that the boy was cursed. The demons would find one touched by Hellfire, which he was because of the red hair. Obviously. I asked her why again, and she told me because she had sinned in her past and deserved punishment, and that giving birth to and loving a child whose soul was tainted beyond salvation must be that punishment. I asked her why, again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But this time she refused to answer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I suppose they got that part right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Father Richard pointed up at the first pane of glass, detailing the very events that the shoddy man described.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re going to tell a tall tale like this one, good man, then maybe try a more original one.&amp;quot; Richards replied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How can it be less original than coming from the mouth of the one who was there?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You couldn&amp;#39;t have been there.&amp;quot; Richards wasn&amp;#39;t sure if this man was stable or sane. He felt cornered, on edge. As if this man was going to do something bad. The shoddy man smiled, but the smile never reached his eyes. Or did it? He appeared entertained, yes, but there was something sinister behind those eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man turned to the pane that always bothered Richard and stood up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve seen it, haven&amp;#39;t you? The truth. Few do.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The truth?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Playing games, really? Somehow, I expected better from you. From all of you, in fact. I did what no one expected me to do. I went through the Abyss and back, literally. I have seen madness in its purest form. Monsters that are the reason you all fear the dark. Filth that&amp;#39;d leave you swiping dirt off this church floor for the rest of your short little life.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pane&amp;#39;s eyes were red. The sun was just right. But there was something different this time. As Father Richard turned to the rest of the panes, all of the Martyr&amp;#39;s eyes turned red in them. Father Richard stood up, in awe of what he saw. How could this be? What&amp;#39;s causing this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am a creature of Spite, Father. People tell me I can&amp;#39;t do something and then I find a way to do it. My friend, the mother of the Prophet, told me then and there that I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly understand what it means to protect something that was once part of you, that you love so deeply that seperating from it is like tearing one&amp;#39;s heart out of their chest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the man took off his jacket, lifted his shirt and showed a bleeding, gored hole in his chest where his heart should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Father Richard stood up and scrambled away, pulling out a holy symbol and praying. The man&amp;#39;s eyes turned red as his blood was spilled on the church floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I gave her my heart that day. And she kept it, for all this time. I let her keep it. And keep it, she did. I asked in return that she spread word of how I changed the world for her. Showed her everything can change, with the will to act. And look what she did. She knew she couldn&amp;#39;t sell &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to the masses. She got greedy. Needy. The power I gave her corrupted her. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised, really. But now, this has gone on for long enough. Now, I&amp;#39;m here to take back what&amp;#39;s mine. My heart. My worship. The world.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You cannot lie here, this is a holy place!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This place is &lt;em&gt;built&lt;/em&gt; on lies. Lies you spread, even though you knew the truth. It&amp;#39;s why remind me of her, Father. You could have known better, but you never dared to tread past your selfish desires of peace and contentment. Spreading the deceit my kind was condemned for, fearing that which has no real hold on you and letting systems of power rule you and your beloved masses. The Abyss has its demon, true. But if you look deep down inside the praying people, you&amp;#39;ll find things worse than your greatest fears Greed. Envy. Wrath. You give in to it and get a free pass. I go against my nature to aid you to prove that I could, and I get condemned and denied. Your Earth is a Hell too, and the humans are its demons.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11lzxt6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/11lzxt6/wp_you_aided_the_humans_in_the_demon_war_they/jbfs9ru/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/11lzxt6/wp_you_aided_the_humans_in_the_demon_war_they/", "name": "t1_jbfs9ru", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678302175.0, "created_utc": 1678302175.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/11lzxt6/wp_you_aided_the_humans_in_the_demon_war_they/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5qf", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "100% cpu usage ever going to be fixed?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DeadSpace", "link_author": "Big-Anything4113", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbbow3w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "HoneypuffCereal", "num_comments": 4, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbbkc9b", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_jnna5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If it's a heating issue, it could cause stuttering.\nCheck your CPU temperature with the hardware monitor.\n\nIf it's a new PC, it shouldn't run hotter than 65C.

The reason why I wrote what I did was because I admittedly have a different view on how this would work, and IMHO some of these things do not really seem negotiable or relatable. \n\nLet me run by the factions one by one to see if I can put it it better words:\n\nOn the Warforged Rebellion, I'm not sure if this is necessarily a 'rebellion'. This seems like a decently agreeable line of thought for warforged. My biggest issue with it is one of the four pillars: modification. It's a bit strange that this is raised as an issue because it shouldn't be. This would be the same as, as a crude example, all iPhones being made exactly the same or slightly different. Of course they're going to be different. Everybody wants something else. And not post production, but during production. I think I don't understand your angle here, as the original post hasn't really gone in depth on what is meant by 'modification'.\n\nNext, the capitalists. There's a fancier name for them, the Aurum. They are a collective of the 1% seeking to make as much money as possible. This sort of things seems like it's right up their alley. But then there's the section on taking away warforged right and producing non-sentient warforged if they could. One thing I'm not sure if you know, is that non-sentient warforged did exist once. They weren't very effective at anything they did, similar to how AI today has limited effectiveness in physical labor and/or production. It's their sentience that made them as successful as they are. To take that way is to make them just dumb machines. Implanting upgrades in them feels like they're reinventing the wheel, which seems inefficient and costly. But most of all, I'm not sure on why they would want this. This seems this idea comes from some rookie CEO who has never actually spent a minute in conversation with a warforged and has been taught how to run a business through monopoly.\n\nThe Silver Flame, I'm sticking with my guns on these guys. The warforged really aren't their problem at the moment unless some sort of serious evidence appears of them actually being the unknowing tools of fiends or something. I would suggest finding a different faction name for this and a different motivation for it as well. As written in your post, there is the sentiment but I can't see if this is actually happening or not or just hearsay, and I expect a church this size and with these objectives to have real reasons for this. And if they do steal power from the flame, well, the church has already gone on a crusade and killed thousands of shifters. I'm sure if they have evidence and feel the need to, they will start seriously campaigning against them. If the flame is weakened by the existence of warforged, they will kill every last one of them, not wait until they are all dead. To them, the fate of the world is at stake. That's not negotiable.\n\nThe Lord of Blades. Take over the world is a bit cartoonish. Maybe that's the point, but I'd have a hard time taking that seriously. It's a shitton of work to rule a world. The dragons aren't going to sit there and let that happen, neither are the Lords of Dust, the elves of Aeranal or Lady Illmarrow. It feels like the most shallow faction that has its goal neutered so that the PC's won't pick it, but I believe it deserves more thought. While the Lord of the Blades is rather extremist, what captivates the warforged that join him is that he has a point. \n\nHouse Cannith Rebellion. To remove sentience from a living being and not consider it a moral of philosophical issue, but considering it  a mistake to be corrected, is terrifying and inhumane. Them coming across as affable and rebellious at the same time somehow compounds this. That's all I'll say on that. \n\nThe Boromar Clan has the same thing going on with the Silver Flame: It's not their MO. They care about racketeering, fencing, stealing, underground shady deals. \"Family\", \"loyalty\". They're mobsters whose cousins ride dinosaurs. I just don't see why these guys are getting all over the warforged issue. They're weapons of war? So what? With the explanation provided, I don't see how this is their fight and their stance, or how it relates to them. The warforged may have been in every standing army, but they're not inherently superior to other people, and they're not unified. Maybe I'm missing something in your explanation, but I just don't buy it.\n\nWhat this comes down to is that the Warforged Rebellion seems the most likely to attract your PC's following for one simple reason: their faction is the only one not to push the warforged, who are already treated as second class, further down the social ranks. Every other faction does, besides the Lord of Blades, who is considered out for the count (though maybe they shouldn't be?). Some want to take away their sentience, others think that drones are just fine and are willing to let the existing ones be replaced as they die off.\n\nThe four pillars that you've built this on don't all feel equally balanced, though you are building on these pillars to build up these factions. They might be working to taking away warforged rights, but how are they going about it? How long are they at it? What are their plans to do it successfully, and how do they plan to succeed at this endevaour? Modification shouldn't be an issue because so many warforged are already modified at this point. Creation forges being shut down is a big issue that deserves to be addressed or even opposed, but the same thing stands. How is that supposed to be changed? By asking the Tribunal? Bribing them? Are they in the position to do so?\n\nThese things you can answer for yourself, it's more that I'm trying to ask these questions so that you have answers for them by the time your players investigate these factions.\n\nThe comments you made:\n\n&gt;Yes, the creation forges are illegal right now. That's not in question. I'm not sure whether I said that was ever in question. The factions in favour of restarting them are attempting to gain the requisite political power to overturn those provisions.\n\nCool. But why do it legally? Shell companies are a thing I'm sure. By shifting some assets here and reallocating some funds there, I'm sure they can set up a creation forge and at least start experimenting. Can't be punished if you're not caught.\n\n&gt;Sentience is also not in debate. None of the factions dispute that existing Warforged are sentient. The dispute is about whether new Warforged should be made, and if so, whether they should be sentient.\n\nWarforged by definition are sentient. Otherwise, I think they'd just be golems or something. And creation forges are good for making those, but not the only way. I can totally see some factions making a 'golem synthesizer' which is _totally not a creation forge_ to start pumping out golems, and _none_ of that would violate the Treaty.\n\n&gt; That goal may be misguided in some way, for instance maybe you can't make a useful Warforged without giving them sentience, but they don't necessarily know that. I don't quite understand why the goal doesn't make sense to them. Especially House Cannith, who stand to make a shit ton of money.\n\nHow does House Cannith stand to make money from golems that don't do their jobs as well as the warforged did? The downgrade is massive and the reputational damage they will take from the underperforming product will be substantial. After the nation they were based and a huge chunk of their assets got nuked in the Mourning, they can't really afford these massive risks with equally massive consequences. They have monopoly on production, but the backlash and controversy this could create would chase any worthwhile investors across the horizons. And what is the market for these golems? Surely someone in their midst will think about this and check the math. This stuff needs to be prototyped and tested long before it hits the market. You say they don't know that you can't make a useful warforged without sentience. I think an argument exists that they should, and that's why this faction doesn't work for me.\n\n&gt; that sentience being unknown is really fucking scary.\n\nSentience _is_ scary, especially when it's not well understood. But these guys are scientists. The solution to the issue here isn't to curbstomp it, the solution is to acquire more data on why this is happening. Once you have that data, set up a hypothesis, then perform more tests. Continue until you've come to a solid, close to unquestionable solution. And _then_ you act. Incredibly smart artificers/scientists acting on fear of the unknown like this doesn't feel gray to me. It feels pitch black, like the void in which Chtulu hides.\n\nThe three factions I limited it to is because that's advice from Keith Baker, the setting's creator. I can't find a link right now as his Session Zero article on his blog redirects the DMGuilds page for Chronicles of Eberron, but it was in there. 6 factions is a _*lot*_ of work and juggling those back and forth between everything the players might do may be a massive headache. It's your game, but that's a hell of a task to make a timeline, objectives, NPC, storylines, contingencies, actions and consequences for.\n\nThanks again for your time, it's fun pondering on this topic!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to you too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think I missed out on some things, let me get to that so you can see why I wrote what I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept the following 4 subjects of yours in mind while writing this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Creation forges/no creation forges&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentience/mindlessness&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upgrades/no upgrades&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Existing Warforged Rights/No Warforged Rights&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of what I wrote did not directly address the points that you put specifically on feedback about the factions, that&amp;#39;s on me. The reason why I wrote what I did was because I admittedly have a different view on how this would work, and IMHO some of these things do not really seem negotiable or relatable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me run by the factions one by one to see if I can put it it better words:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the Warforged Rebellion, I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is necessarily a &amp;#39;rebellion&amp;#39;. This seems like a decently agreeable line of thought for warforged. My biggest issue with it is one of the four pillars: modification. It&amp;#39;s a bit strange that this is raised as an issue because it shouldn&amp;#39;t be. This would be the same as, as a crude example, all iPhones being made exactly the same or slightly different. Of course they&amp;#39;re going to be different. Everybody wants something else. And not post production, but during production. I think I don&amp;#39;t understand your angle here, as the original post hasn&amp;#39;t really gone in depth on what is meant by &amp;#39;modification&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, the capitalists. There&amp;#39;s a fancier name for them, the Aurum. They are a collective of the 1% seeking to make as much money as possible. This sort of things seems like it&amp;#39;s right up their alley. But then there&amp;#39;s the section on taking away warforged right and producing non-sentient warforged if they could. One thing I&amp;#39;m not sure if you know, is that non-sentient warforged did exist once. They weren&amp;#39;t very effective at anything they did, similar to how AI today has limited effectiveness in physical labor and/or production. It&amp;#39;s their sentience that made them as successful as they are. To take that way is to make them just dumb machines. Implanting upgrades in them feels like they&amp;#39;re reinventing the wheel, which seems inefficient and costly. But most of all, I&amp;#39;m not sure on why they would want this. This seems this idea comes from some rookie CEO who has never actually spent a minute in conversation with a warforged and has been taught how to run a business through monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Silver Flame, I&amp;#39;m sticking with my guns on these guys. The warforged really aren&amp;#39;t their problem at the moment unless some sort of serious evidence appears of them actually being the unknowing tools of fiends or something. I would suggest finding a different faction name for this and a different motivation for it as well. As written in your post, there is the sentiment but I can&amp;#39;t see if this is actually happening or not or just hearsay, and I expect a church this size and with these objectives to have real reasons for this. And if they do steal power from the flame, well, the church has already gone on a crusade and killed thousands of shifters. I&amp;#39;m sure if they have evidence and feel the need to, they will start seriously campaigning against them. If the flame is weakened by the existence of warforged, they will kill every last one of them, not wait until they are all dead. To them, the fate of the world is at stake. That&amp;#39;s not negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Lord of Blades. Take over the world is a bit cartoonish. Maybe that&amp;#39;s the point, but I&amp;#39;d have a hard time taking that seriously. It&amp;#39;s a shitton of work to rule a world. The dragons aren&amp;#39;t going to sit there and let that happen, neither are the Lords of Dust, the elves of Aeranal or Lady Illmarrow. It feels like the most shallow faction that has its goal neutered so that the PC&amp;#39;s won&amp;#39;t pick it, but I believe it deserves more thought. While the Lord of the Blades is rather extremist, what captivates the warforged that join him is that he has a point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;House Cannith Rebellion. To remove sentience from a living being and not consider it a moral of philosophical issue, but considering it  a mistake to be corrected, is terrifying and inhumane. Them coming across as affable and rebellious at the same time somehow compounds this. That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ll say on that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Boromar Clan has the same thing going on with the Silver Flame: It&amp;#39;s not their MO. They care about racketeering, fencing, stealing, underground shady deals. &amp;quot;Family&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;loyalty&amp;quot;. They&amp;#39;re mobsters whose cousins ride dinosaurs. I just don&amp;#39;t see why these guys are getting all over the warforged issue. They&amp;#39;re weapons of war? So what? With the explanation provided, I don&amp;#39;t see how this is their fight and their stance, or how it relates to them. The warforged may have been in every standing army, but they&amp;#39;re not inherently superior to other people, and they&amp;#39;re not unified. Maybe I&amp;#39;m missing something in your explanation, but I just don&amp;#39;t buy it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What this comes down to is that the Warforged Rebellion seems the most likely to attract your PC&amp;#39;s following for one simple reason: their faction is the only one not to push the warforged, who are already treated as second class, further down the social ranks. Every other faction does, besides the Lord of Blades, who is considered out for the count (though maybe they shouldn&amp;#39;t be?). Some want to take away their sentience, others think that drones are just fine and are willing to let the existing ones be replaced as they die off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The four pillars that you&amp;#39;ve built this on don&amp;#39;t all feel equally balanced, though you are building on these pillars to build up these factions. They might be working to taking away warforged rights, but how are they going about it? How long are they at it? What are their plans to do it successfully, and how do they plan to succeed at this endevaour? Modification shouldn&amp;#39;t be an issue because so many warforged are already modified at this point. Creation forges being shut down is a big issue that deserves to be addressed or even opposed, but the same thing stands. How is that supposed to be changed? By asking the Tribunal? Bribing them? Are they in the position to do so?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These things you can answer for yourself, it&amp;#39;s more that I&amp;#39;m trying to ask these questions so that you have answers for them by the time your players investigate these factions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The comments you made:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, the creation forges are illegal right now. That&amp;#39;s not in question. I&amp;#39;m not sure whether I said that was ever in question. The factions in favour of restarting them are attempting to gain the requisite political power to overturn those provisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool. But why do it legally? Shell companies are a thing I&amp;#39;m sure. By shifting some assets here and reallocating some funds there, I&amp;#39;m sure they can set up a creation forge and at least start experimenting. Can&amp;#39;t be punished if you&amp;#39;re not caught.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sentience is also not in debate. None of the factions dispute that existing Warforged are sentient. The dispute is about whether new Warforged should be made, and if so, whether they should be sentient.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warforged by definition are sentient. Otherwise, I think they&amp;#39;d just be golems or something. And creation forges are good for making those, but not the only way. I can totally see some factions making a &amp;#39;golem synthesizer&amp;#39; which is &lt;em&gt;totally not a creation forge&lt;/em&gt; to start pumping out golems, and &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of that would violate the Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That goal may be misguided in some way, for instance maybe you can&amp;#39;t make a useful Warforged without giving them sentience, but they don&amp;#39;t necessarily know that. I don&amp;#39;t quite understand why the goal doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to them. Especially House Cannith, who stand to make a shit ton of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does House Cannith stand to make money from golems that don&amp;#39;t do their jobs as well as the warforged did? The downgrade is massive and the reputational damage they will take from the underperforming product will be substantial. After the nation they were based and a huge chunk of their assets got nuked in the Mourning, they can&amp;#39;t really afford these massive risks with equally massive consequences. They have monopoly on production, but the backlash and controversy this could create would chase any worthwhile investors across the horizons. And what is the market for these golems? Surely someone in their midst will think about this and check the math. This stuff needs to be prototyped and tested long before it hits the market. You say they don&amp;#39;t know that you can&amp;#39;t make a useful warforged without sentience. I think an argument exists that they should, and that&amp;#39;s why this faction doesn&amp;#39;t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;that sentience being unknown is really fucking scary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentience &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; scary, especially when it&amp;#39;s not well understood. But these guys are scientists. The solution to the issue here isn&amp;#39;t to curbstomp it, the solution is to acquire more data on why this is happening. Once you have that data, set up a hypothesis, then perform more tests. Continue until you&amp;#39;ve come to a solid, close to unquestionable solution. And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you act. Incredibly smart artificers/scientists acting on fear of the unknown like this doesn&amp;#39;t feel gray to me. It feels pitch black, like the void in which Chtulu hides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The three factions I limited it to is because that&amp;#39;s advice from Keith Baker, the setting&amp;#39;s creator.

So first, off, everything I sum up here is ripe for discarding. It's your Eberron, you do you. That's the most important thing here.\n\nFirst, when the Last War ended, it was done so by a treaty, the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty established borders of the five nations that have fought in this war for almost a century, separating the nation of Galifar into five.\n\nOne of the things clarified in the Treaty is that warforged get rights, the same rights that everyone else across the nations get. To compensate for this, however, all creation forges were shut down.\n\nThis is international law and punishable by getting sent to the Dreadhold, where you will be petrified for what amounts to eternity. This place is where the worst of the worst gets sent to. No matter who you are, where you are from or what you did, if it's bad enough, you get turned into a statue forever. These provisions are taken very seriously. They might have opposition, but they will be accepted as decreed by the leaders of the nations acknowledged by this treaty (which is almost every nation except the ones without a unified government or Droaam).\n\nNow that that is established:\n\nThe creation forges will never reactivate _legally_. Anyone doing so is a criminal who will be brought to Eberron's equivalent of the Hague. Their rights are secured. Lawyers can and will fight for them. \n\nModifications happen all the times, especially with the later ones made. This is because at the start, they were still figuring out how to create warforged in the most optimal fashion. These are the more 'barebones' ones, these are fighters and barbarians. Meat for an army. Later ones became artificers, sorcerers, wizards and all sorts of classes. Some get tools integrated into their bodies, some get weapons, some get telescopes and maps on the seas, some are rangers or rogues built for guerilla warfare. I've seen some warforged that look relatively humanoid as some sort of infiltrator models.\n\nModifications are commonly available. It's really not a big deal.\n\nSentience is not really argued either. It is acknowledged that they have sentience, otherwise they would not have gotten their rights in the Treaty. People's problems with the warforged isn't because they may or may not have souls. They are capable of thinking, of original thought. There are warforged musicians, painters, poets, all sorts of artistic skill is expressed in a way only they can. They can argue, reason, think. This is painfully obvious because you can _have a conversation with them_. People might look the other way, but then they're just sticking their head in the sand. It's something more for an offshoot, isolated community to believe in, not something that gains mass following.\n\nPublic approval of warforged is a different story, for two reasons:\n\n- They are the face of the Last War. They were built for fighting in it. They killed people with ruthless efficiency, because they were taught to and forbidden to do anything else. Every nation had them, and every nation lost entire village, towns, thousands of people to these. Post traumatic stress syndrome and other trauma associated behaviours have popped up because of it. Warforged are hated because they were seen as killing machines, but they have proven themselves not to be.\n\n- Utility. Warforged don't rest as long as other humanoids. They have rights but no idea what to do with them. They seek a life with purpose, as they were built for a war that has now ended. Now they're trying to find meaning in their lives, just like any of us. But they're treated as second class citizens because of the first point. They were mass manufactured but they don't have an assigned place in the world anymore because the world wasn't built with them as part of active citizens in mind, and they are having a hard time trying to find their place in the world. That's not a struggle unique to them, it's just that those who hate them (mostly Thrane but there are pockets of haters all over Khorvaire) may want them destroyed so that they don't have to see them all the time. Warforged, as basically secondary class citizens, get paid less, get lesser housing, require no food and shorter rests. Efficient corporations like the Dragonmarked Houses hire warforged because they work longer for lesser housing costs. It's literally 'they took our jobs', and all that entails. \n\nNow, there _is_ a good argument for wanting the creation forges restarted: Warforged numbers are dwindling as no new warforged are made, but they die nonetheless. Some are killed in mobs, some in the line of duty, some in the middle of nowhere. This will cause the warforged to die out eventually. Something the warforged don't believe they deserve. Of course they want to live in this world as much as the rest of everyone else, but simply because they exist no the way they do and had no choice in, means they have to watch their own people go extinct so that the people in charge don't have to worry about this dilemma in the future. Which is horrible, of course. So yes, there will be factions of people that want to restart the creation forges.\n\nLegally, or otherwise. The Lord of Blades does not give a fuck about the laws of the five nations and is trying to get a creation forge working, but he's having issues because the Mourning is interfering with the only creation forge he has working so far. What warforged he has produced is limited in number, and they are honestly too broken and just _wrong_ to be considered warforged.\n\nMerrix D'Cannith Junior is said to have a working creation forge, located in Old Sharn. He is known as a warforged synpathizer, as the warforged of today are a creation of his father Aaren. His father's legacy. \n\nThe 'warforged rebellion' as noted can exist, but the focus shouldn't be on modifications as much as you're putting up. Every warforged is already unique, and what arguments are you really going to make for 'no, they should be exact copies and nothing else unless they want to modify themselves'. I can't imagine that for any other race. Why would it work like that for them? Aren't they dealing with enough shit? They just want the right to exist like everyone else on this world.\n\nThe 'capitalists' will not mess with the Treaty. They have a lot of sway, but the Tribunal is something even they can't mess with. And it's too much of a hassle anyway. They can hire warforged right now anyway, just pay them a bit, get some basic housing and you'll still be cheaper when compared to hiring any other kind of humanoid. And the modifications they can already make, make them incredibly flexible, they are hard workers who don't have unions, and so on. \n\nThe silver flame is far too busy dealing with devils and demons across Khorivaire and beyond to really, seriously crusade against warforged. They're fine with letting warforged into their ranks, they'll take what they can get. A child is their pope. Gender, species, background, capabilities, doesn't matter. They stand against evil in every shape of form and will use whatever they can get to do that. Thrane as a nation generally doesn't like them and grants them life, just not in Thrane. Any warforged caught out there might get rocks pelted at them. And stealing energy form the  flame? You got to get something really good going here to make that remotely convinces people that this is the case. Even if you do, the Silver Flame is not the primary religion in Khorvaire. Those who follow the Nine, the Six or the Blood of Vol won't give a damn, and that's about 80% of the population. A vocal minority at best.\n\nThe reason for warforged sentience is not well understood but that didn't stop House Cannith from producing literally thousands of them. Why? Because those in House Cannith _know_ and if they don't, they have theories, but they don't care. It's why they've been producing them for thirty odd years until the end of the war. And they made an absolute shitton of money. Imagine one of these artificers talking with a warforged artificer who ends up casting detect thought on this House Cannith branch member, who thinks 'you're not supposed to exist, you're a mistake'. How can people live in this day and age and think that? Warforged are not machines. They live. They think. They feel. To deny this is to deny reality itself.\n\nThe Boromar Clan has no problem with warforged. Well, warforged tend to be pretty lawful as they are taught to respect authority and to have discipline, so they won't want to have anything to do with warforged specifically. Maybe some of those warforged joined the Sharn Guard to return to a life of order, structure and maintaining peace. But the Clan would have a problem with them because they're Sharn Guard, not because they're warforged. Warforged aren't weapons that established dominance, no more than Karrnath did with their armies of undead. Were they dominant? No. No nations really was. They were born from the war, made for war. Hell, the Clan is probably more than happy to get some warforged brutes to work for them, if there are those out there who are willing to accept their money.\n\n\n----\n\nTBC", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, right. So first, off, everything I sum up here is ripe for discarding. It&amp;#39;s your Eberron, you do you. That&amp;#39;s the most important thing here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, when the Last War ended, it was done so by a treaty, the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty established borders of the five nations that have fought in this war for almost a century, separating the nation of Galifar into five.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the things clarified in the Treaty is that warforged get rights, the same rights that everyone else across the nations get. To compensate for this, however, all creation forges were shut down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is international law and punishable by getting sent to the Dreadhold, where you will be petrified for what amounts to eternity. This place is where the worst of the worst gets sent to. No matter who you are, where you are from or what you did, if it&amp;#39;s bad enough, you get turned into a statue forever. These provisions are taken very seriously. They might have opposition, but they will be accepted as decreed by the leaders of the nations acknowledged by this treaty (which is almost every nation except the ones without a unified government or Droaam).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that that is established:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creation forges will never reactivate &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone doing so is a criminal who will be brought to Eberron&amp;#39;s equivalent of the Hague. Their rights are secured. Lawyers can and will fight for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Modifications happen all the times, especially with the later ones made. This is because at the start, they were still figuring out how to create warforged in the most optimal fashion. These are the more &amp;#39;barebones&amp;#39; ones, these are fighters and barbarians. Meat for an army. Later ones became artificers, sorcerers, wizards and all sorts of classes. Some get tools integrated into their bodies, some get weapons, some get telescopes and maps on the seas, some are rangers or rogues built for guerilla warfare. I&amp;#39;ve seen some warforged that look relatively humanoid as some sort of infiltrator models.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Modifications are commonly available. It&amp;#39;s really not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sentience is not really argued either. It is acknowledged that they have sentience, otherwise they would not have gotten their rights in the Treaty. People&amp;#39;s problems with the warforged isn&amp;#39;t because they may or may not have souls. They are capable of thinking, of original thought. There are warforged musicians, painters, poets, all sorts of artistic skill is expressed in a way only they can. They can argue, reason, think. This is painfully obvious because you can &lt;em&gt;have a conversation with them&lt;/em&gt;. People might look the other way, but then they&amp;#39;re just sticking their head in the sand. It&amp;#39;s something more for an offshoot, isolated community to believe in, not something that gains mass following.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public approval of warforged is a different story, for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are the face of the Last War. They were built for fighting in it. They killed people with ruthless efficiency, because they were taught to and forbidden to do anything else. Every nation had them, and every nation lost entire village, towns, thousands of people to these. Post traumatic stress syndrome and other trauma associated behaviours have popped up because of it. Warforged are hated because they were seen as killing machines, but they have proven themselves not to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utility. Warforged don&amp;#39;t rest as long as other humanoids. They have rights but no idea what to do with them. They seek a life with purpose, as they were built for a war that has now ended. Now they&amp;#39;re trying to find meaning in their lives, just like any of us. But they&amp;#39;re treated as second class citizens because of the first point. They were mass manufactured but they don&amp;#39;t have an assigned place in the world anymore because the world wasn&amp;#39;t built with them as part of active citizens in mind, and they are having a hard time trying to find their place in the world. That&amp;#39;s not a struggle unique to them, it&amp;#39;s just that those who hate them (mostly Thrane but there are pockets of haters all over Khorvaire) may want them destroyed so that they don&amp;#39;t have to see them all the time. Warforged, as basically secondary class citizens, get paid less, get lesser housing, require no food and shorter rests. Efficient corporations like the Dragonmarked Houses hire warforged because they work longer for lesser housing costs. It&amp;#39;s literally &amp;#39;they took our jobs&amp;#39;, and all that entails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a good argument for wanting the creation forges restarted: Warforged numbers are dwindling as no new warforged are made, but they die nonetheless. Some are killed in mobs, some in the line of duty, some in the middle of nowhere. This will cause the warforged to die out eventually. Something the warforged don&amp;#39;t believe they deserve. Of course they want to live in this world as much as the rest of everyone else, but simply because they exist no the way they do and had no choice in, means they have to watch their own people go extinct so that the people in charge don&amp;#39;t have to worry about this dilemma in the future. Which is horrible, of course. So yes, there will be factions of people that want to restart the creation forges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legally, or otherwise. The Lord of Blades does not give a fuck about the laws of the five nations and is trying to get a creation forge working, but he&amp;#39;s having issues because the Mourning is interfering with the only creation forge he has working so far. What warforged he has produced is limited in number, and they are honestly too broken and just &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; to be considered warforged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Merrix D&amp;#39;Cannith Junior is said to have a working creation forge, located in Old Sharn. He is known as a warforged synpathizer, as the warforged of today are a creation of his father Aaren. His father&amp;#39;s legacy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;warforged rebellion&amp;#39; as noted can exist, but the focus shouldn&amp;#39;t be on modifications as much as you&amp;#39;re putting up. Every warforged is already unique, and what arguments are you really going to make for &amp;#39;no, they should be exact copies and nothing else unless they want to modify themselves&amp;#39;. I can&amp;#39;t imagine that for any other race. Why would it work like that for them? Aren&amp;#39;t they dealing with enough shit? They just want the right to exist like everyone else on this world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;capitalists&amp;#39; will not mess with the Treaty. They have a lot of sway, but the Tribunal is something even they can&amp;#39;t mess with. And it&amp;#39;s too much of a hassle anyway. They can hire warforged right now anyway, just pay them a bit, get some basic housing and you&amp;#39;ll still be cheaper when compared to hiring any other kind of humanoid. And the modifications they can already make, make them incredibly flexible, they are hard workers who don&amp;#39;t have unions, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The silver flame is far too busy dealing with devils and demons across Khorivaire and beyond to really, seriously crusade against warforged. They&amp;#39;re fine with letting warforged into their ranks, they&amp;#39;ll take what they can get. A child is their pope. Gender, species, background, capabilities, doesn&amp;#39;t matter. They stand against evil in every shape of form and will use whatever they can get to do that. Thrane as a nation generally doesn&amp;#39;t like them and grants them life, just not in Thrane. Any warforged caught out there might get rocks pelted at them. And stealing energy form the  flame? You got to get something really good going here to make that remotely convinces people that this is the case. Even if you do, the Silver Flame is not the primary religion in Khorvaire. Those who follow the Nine, the Six or the Blood of Vol won&amp;#39;t give a damn, and that&amp;#39;s about 80% of the population. A vocal minority at best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for warforged sentience is not well understood but that didn&amp;#39;t stop House Cannith from producing literally thousands of them. Why? Because those in House Cannith &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; and if they don&amp;#39;t, they have theories, but they don&amp;#39;t care. It&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ve been producing them for thirty odd years until the end of the war. And they made an absolute shitton of money. Imagine one of these artificers talking with a warforged artificer who ends up casting detect thought on this House Cannith branch member, who thinks &amp;#39;you&amp;#39;re not supposed to exist, you&amp;#39;re a mistake&amp;#39;. How can people live in this day and age and think that? Warforged are not machines. They live. They think. They feel. To deny this is to deny reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Boromar Clan has no problem with warforged.

Now, this guy is a lazy fucker. He exerts as little effort as possible. Durostoran delegates because he's fucking around with dragons, Hektula and Mordakhesh delegate because they're doing a lot of shit at the same time and run a lot of plots to free their masters. That takes active effort on their part. Kashtarhak isn't like that. He could easily put more effort into what he does, but when he does put effort in, he does it well. His own claims extend to insurrections such as the elvish uprising against the giants and the fall of the goblins, though he's probably involved in others. He is very much exactly the kind of Rakshasa that one in the monster manual displays. Pitting one civilizations against another by getting shitty people appointed and letting them crumble from within, supporting the opposition of the status quo such as desperate rebels, criminal empires and questionable claimants to the throne in case a king unexpectedly dies (which he probably caused). One big gun that he has in his pocket is a succubus assassin called Thelestes, the Red Velvet. She has Durostoran desire for murder, but doesn't limit herself to dragons. And she might not have the power of an archmage, but her enthusiasm for killing things makes up for it (though the Council doesn't give her enough things to kill to her liking, so she just does her thing until called). Having an assassin that can teleport, go to the Ethereal Plane and back at will, become invisible, shapeshift and charm people makes her an excellent agent. I can totally imagine them both going to a gala, pretending to be the same person, staying in contact exactly who is where at what times, alternating if needs be. He then appears to be Lord Byron or something while Thelestes is also Lord Byron stabbing Lord Axial to death. Speak with Dead might cause Lord Axial to say it was Lord Byron, a Zone of Truth might be put on Kashtarak (which doesn't work because magic immunity) who says it wasn't him. Perfect for a murder mystery, though a really convoluted one. \n\nKorliac of the Grey Flame, like Thelestes, is a fiend that doesn't originate from the Material Plane. Korliac left Fernia as his madness compelled him to seek forbidden knowledge. He is the prakhutu to Tul Oreshka, the Truth in Darkness. This mad fuckstick believes it is his destiny to shatter the universe into madness and gray flame. A total nutter. All of his fire spells also affect targets as if they have been targeted by the Confusion spell. He can shapeshift into medium and small humanoid shapes and use fire shield and scorching ray at will. If you have a campaign in Xen'drik, this might be the guy, as he's particularly active there even though his home base is in the Demon Wastes. Probably found a way through Khyber. How does he know that? Tul Oreshka seems like the type of Overlord to tell him. The knowledge that she shares are the kinds of revelations that break people. If you've ever played Dishonored, an artifact of hers could be the heart Corvo uses to detect wahlebones that he uses to upgrade his abilities. When pointed at a person, it whispers a secret about them to corvo. Fear of rats. Wanted to be a sailor. Was beaten by their dad. These are simple things. Tul Oreshka whispers what people really think about you, what sort of fucked up shit was done by the people that you admire, the time and or manner of your death. That's personal. But the truth about Xoriat, the Daelkyr and madness that they spread. How to control it. What nightmares someone has and what traumas they have experienced, maybe because of something good you did. The stuff of madness. That's Tul Oreshka. It's the truth that will make you consider cutting your ears off because you just can't stand it anymore. The truth will hurt you, break you, at some point. And Korliac? He lives for it. He wants to use it to burn the world. He guards his Gray Flame and listens to it, as his mistress whispers to him the forbidden secrets of the world. He might know the deep dark secrets of the player characters and blackmails them into doing his bidding. He might give the PC's opponents information on the party that no one but them could know. If the player characters have secrets that they want to take to the grave, then he'll know. It's just a matter of time. I gave him spells that target Intelligence and Wisdom, like Mind Sliver, Tasha's Mind Whip, Raulothim's Psychic Lance, Feeblemind and Dissonant Whispers to represent the effects on the minds when he speaks these truths to them.\n\nThese are the prakhutu that are particularly noteworthy in my opinion, but there are a couple of cool overlords that don't have one yet:\n\n- Katashka the Gatekeeper. This Overlord doesn't just have fiends serving him, but also undead. Liches, Skull Lords, Dracoliches, Death Knights. He was said to have been the first to make them all. One Greatwyrm Dracolich in particular, Mazyralyx, is said to have been the first dracolich and believes themselves to be the true avatar of the Keeper, of the Dark Six.\n- The Wild Heart. He has a Prakhutu, Drulkalatar Atesh. Not much is known about this one besides that he is implied to be involved in the Lycanthropic purge. Apparently, he is masquerading as Drul Kantar, the oni warlord in the service of the Daughters of Sora Kell. I assume he has druidic magic to his disposal, as a touch of homebrew, I'd say his claws spread lycanthropy instead of a sleepless curse. Wildshape and shapeshifting seems fitting. The Wild Heart's release has something to do with the lycanthropes going absolutely mad in the Eldeen Reaches, as that was what nearly woke him almost a century ago.\n\n- Tiamat, the Daughter of Khyber. She is the greed and desire to dominate in the hearts of every dragon. She has no Prakhutu, her Talons of Tiamat do their own work with her separately. Abishai are her preferred agents. Tiamat resides in the pit of sorrows. Those who guard her are eventually executed, as any dragon that stays near her for a prolonged period of time is corrupted eventually. But to leave her unguarded is simply asking for her servants to get close. It's a lose-lose situation. Dragons who take this duty are honored beyond their passing with a dragon flight with their families, a reminder of a brave soul that gave their life so that one of the greatest evils of the planet was contained through their sacrifice.

Dragons who take this duty are honored beyond their passing with a dragon flight with their families, a reminder of a brave soul that gave their life so that one of the greatest evils of the planet was contained through their sacrifice. If your campaign is centered around dragons and Argonessen, this is your villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11cowqn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Eberron/comments/11cowqn/anybody_has_a_good_idea_for_the_bleak_council/ja59iwu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Eberron/comments/11cowqn/anybody_has_a_good_idea_for_the_bleak_council/", "name": "t1_ja59iwu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Eberron", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677452710.0, "created_utc": 1677452710.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Eberron/comments/11cowqn/anybody_has_a_good_idea_for_the_bleak_council/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ubfw", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Anybody has a good idea for the bleak council?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 9, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Eberron", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ja4ywbt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "HoneypuffCereal", "num_comments": 9, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11cowqn", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_jnna5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Bleak Council?

I sincerely doubt a 4 man level 20 party can defeat all of them in one go, and going about and killing them one by one might not even work as the strongest amongst them rejuvenate in days after they die.\n\nI'd focus on a couple of members of note. I have come up with some of the following:\n\n- Hektula, the Bloody Scribe. Everyone's favorite librarian. She has access to every spell known and plenty unknown. Hektula writes tomes filled with secret and forbidden arcane knowledge and fills whole libraries with them. These can be spread all across Khorvaire by her agents and may very well be a source of a Warlock's or Wizard's origin. If you have one of these in the party, she might be the patron. Sul Khatesh wants her magic to be used to terrify people. Magic that transforms people into horrors, like liches, zombies or vampires. Magic that turns people into bloody smears or tears into their minds. Magic that breaks and destroys, hurts and scars. She's also one of the foremost experts on the Draconic Prophecy, supplies the Council with them and helps them interpret it. If your players need to learn the wish spell, she has it. If your players can't figure out a part of a Draconic Prophecy, she already knows it. If someone wants to know about the lost magic of Qabarin, she probably has a couple of books about it. She's immortal, she might as well have been there. But why would she help the party? Does she want something in return, or does she give it away for free? Hektula will always say exactly what she needs to say and nothing more. But what she might say might still be a lot. She could reveal that she is the parton of the Warlock or the Wizard, or the Druid, maybe even the Cleric or the Paladin. That all the good that they have done was possible because of her. And that that all of that could go away and all it would take would be the snap of her fingers. Unless they do something for her. Kill a king or queen in a specific way. Perform a certain ritual in a certain place at a certain time. It would appear nearly nonsensical, almost like a random set of gibberish words. But she would know the importance. She might very well have led them all to this very moment in time so she could make it abundantly clear that they aren't in charge of the book being written, but that she is. They call her the Scribe for a reason, and all her stories and in blood. Your characters could rebel, go against it. They could stand to lose everything. But maybe that would be her plan all along. Maybe she simply pissed them off to make them kill someone they're supposed to protect. Safeguard something they're supposed to destroy. She will always be three steps ahead of the players. The puppetmaster that makes the PC's dance to her whims. And when something that happens needs to happen, she'll be there. To see it happen with her own eyes. And if her plans are ruined, she might not care. She is immortal. She can simply wait for the PC's to die and try again. Or maybe she wants to blow off some steam and she summons a Mad Servant of Leuko to singe-handedly level the building. This is the part where you go ham as a DM. See Chronicles of Eberron for her statblock.\n\n- Mordakhesh, the Shadowsword. The badass Rakshasa warrior, a legendary warrior. This is the guy whose third name could easily be \"Warcrime\". He was a warlord in the days of the Age of Demons and climbed to Rak Tulkesh's prahkhutu by carving a bloody path to that position. He hunts and kills dragons in his spare time and has taken their scales and adorns his armor with them. Occasionally, when some big battle happens, he might replace a knight and pretend to be them with disguise self and starts murdering his way across the battlefield because he just loves fighting and killing _that much_.  He has played a hand throughout all of Khorvaire's history. He taught the goblinoids how to forge weapons and armor, he fought with Malleon the Reaver during the conquest of the goblin, he was there when Old Sharn fell. But that isn't all he does. He fights to free his patron, Rak Tulkesh. His servant have had a hand in almost every slaughter, every atrocity, every bloodbath in the Last War, including its start. But those who chase him might not understand his personal involvement. He is a spymaster and a swindler, spearheading dozens of plots across Khorvaire. It's gotten to the point where he is a major stakeholder in many newspapers that write sensational news to make people scared and hateful, riles them up with misinformation on all levels of governments and funds weapons manufacturing. Kind of like Lord of War but fully aware what he is doing and loving all the hate, murder and bloodshed he's causing, as well as a massive badass who can use the weapons he sells better than the people he sells them to. He's _charming as fuck_ and can simply talk people into doing terrible things by making it seem like a completely correct, justifiable and logical thing to do. He's done so since the Age of Demons. One of the things mentioned in Rising from the Last War is that seeks to free Rak Tulkesh by bathing Khorvaire in blood. He's doing a pretty good job. I'd have it be that the Prophecy requires a one hundred year war, and he's trying to make the Last War count because there is no winner, so it's currently 'on hold'. In my Eberron, he's stirring the pot in Thaliost. That place is a powderkeg because the people in charge are (mostly) his pawns, and they're trying to restart the war there, but they're doubtful due to the Mourning. He might hire the PC's to go in there, find out what caused it, tell him what happened so that he can assure people that it was a one-off, spread that news globally, confirm it and restart the war in Thaliost.\n\n- Durostoran the Wyrmbreaker. This guy is a real nemesis to the dragons of Argonessen. Mordakhesh kills dragons for sport or in his free time, this guy does it because he just _really_ likes fucking with them. He studies the draconic prophecy to fuck with dragons, he's manipulating events in Aeranal to fuck with the dragons. He foils the Chamber's plan constantly as he is gifted with deciphering  the prophecy and can figure out what they're trying to do as they do it. None of this has anything to do with Bel Shalor so far, who he is the speaker for. When it comes to that, there's remarkably little stuff available for him? In my Eberron, he's the kind of 'manager' that is far too busy doing his own thing and delegates _everything_ to any 'staff' below him. He has an army of minions that he prefers to chuck at any conflict concerning the Shadow in the Flame, although he takes matters into his own claws....sometimes. He's a master of deception and illusions just to illustrate how much he just enjoys fucking with people. Disguising himself as an ally wizard then barraging them with devastating spells, illusions and enchantments only to get the fuck out and lead them to the real wizard that is completely clueless about what happened is very typical, if he shows up. Melysse Miron was also probably his doing, because fucking with the Church of the Silver Flame probably seemed like a fun thing to do. IME, he's pretty much Acererak if Acererak was a Rakshasa with a grudge against dragons. He's just off doing his own thing, ruining everything he touches because it's just so much _fun_. If you plan to have dragons or the Chamber in your campaign, Durostoran can start to mess things up. Perhaps he singlehandedly cleared the dungeon before a party shows up and stole all the loot, then dumped it on the hoard of the dragon that sent them to get it, causing conflict. Then has an agent reach out and get 'evidence' of the dragon being evil and having been corrupted or banished from Argonessen without telling them. Perhaps showing up in dreams and telling the party to not trust dragons. Maybe in those dreams, he shows the Rogue's parents being murdered by the alter ego of a dragon, even though that didn't actually happen. If the Rogue is then convinced the dragon killed his parents, it might end up with either the dragon killed or the party hurt, and he swoops in and kills the dragon, has a laugh, then leaves without any explanation like a total chad. He'd be the guy to give an Aernal Elf an Orb of Dragonkind he made, then goes around and has his agents tell fucking _everyone_ in a 200 mile radius that _that guy has an orb that makes dragons follow his command_. Then he sits down, watches the sunset with a nice mimosa until a squad of dragons show up to seize the orb, after which he swoops in, summons whatever kind of fiendish monsters he can come up with and sends them charging at the dragons in whatever their remote base of operations is. If the dragons do get hold of it, he sets off a remote detonation the size of a nuke once they're far enough out of range and laughs his ass off. He's the kind of guy who has a shitton of serious firepower but uses it for very selfish reasons, and his colleagues respect him because of it, even if he is a little too fanatical about dragon murder. \n\n----\n\nTBC", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bleak Council?

It's got only a couple of rounds and its defending it's phylactery, so it's going all out with the highest spell slots it has access to.

Pictures of crime scenes as I left them. Victims when they were alive and after she and I killed them, stripping them of their flesh, draining their blood. The pictures came down on the desk, and he saw them. His eyes went wide like a dear in headlights. The heart in his chest that is bound to fail in two years starts beating twice as fast as he sees the pictures. He stands up immediately, the chair he rested on falling backwards, clanging on the stone floor. The pistol in his holster is drawn with damn near expertise and is pointed at my head.\n\n---\n\nI have been seated in this room for about three hours now. It's strange, but I'm sure they need time to put it all together. They don't know what I know. What they have, what they found when they searched me, as puzzle pieces that are incomplete. They won't like what they'll see if they put the whole thing together.\n\nMy strange friend, the police officer named Daniel Lofter, stands behind the glass, along with a federal agent and a detective. They've been discussing things such as evidence, motive, probably cause, the case they've built over the years. It's mind-numbingly boring chit chat, for which I don't have time.\n\n\"I suggest you ask your questions quickly. My time is limited. Before long, my partner will now I went to the police and will come here to kill me. If she finds you standing between me and her, she'll wipe you off the face of the planet. I know you only found 11 bodies. I will tell you where the other 4 are, *if* you send someone here.\"\n\nI realized I came across as a bit desperate. Now that I'm not near her anymore, I'm starting to feel something. An impending sense of doom, like people who suffer heart attacks do. She helped suppress the fear. But the thoughts behind the mirror were also starting to get harder to decipher. My power is waning. She knows. She'll be coming. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.\n\nThe detective, after some quick dialogue, retreats from the room, walks around the walls and enters the room, holding a rather thick folder. A woman with an aged complexion, dark, well maintain long curls and the body language of determination and confidence. I respect that. \n\nShe considers slamming the file on the table, but maintains her composure and gently sets it down. Now that she's closer, I can tell her basic thoughts. Diana. That's her name. The very face of professionality and discipline. Cool and calm, collected. But I can smell the fury in her breath. The seething disappointment. In her head, she imagines brutalizing me, beating me to a pulp with her fists and a chair. Kicking me, slamming my heard through the one-way mirror and grinding my neck across the broken glass, tearing my neck to pieces. But she doesn't.\n\n\"I'm here. Things align with what you've said so far. We have more questions.\"\n\n\"I have some things to say first. About my partner. She is coming.\"\n\n\"So you weren't acting alone?\"\n\n\"No. No I wasn't.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd prefer we start from the beginning here, so if we can put a narrative of sorts together.\"\n\n\"There's not time for that. You don't get it, detective, and I envy your ignorance. I have seen what she does. I know what she can make people do. She walks in human form, but that *thing* is not human. She is beyond you, beyond me. I simply got too close to her, got infected by her very presence.\"\n\n\"I did not prepare myself for a comic book villain breakdown, so try to keep your cool, here. An interrogator is on the way.\"\n\n\"Detective Matthews. He's flying in from Houston. 43 years old, a wife and two kids. Worked in different positions of the force over the last 15 years, from patrol officer all the way to his current position. His wife feels lonely when he isn't around, because he's a workaholic. When he dies, he will be the kind of person to regret not having spent as much time with his children as he could. He feels guilty over it already, and drinks to make it go away. Well, that and some of the other experiences he's had. Stellar record with the force, though. A good choice. If my partner doesn't rip the plane out of the sky, just to let us know that she's coming because now that I know, so does she.\"\n\nI can *feel* the anxiety in her head, crawling from the bottom of her brains, around the outside, to the top. As if skeletal hands cradle her brains and give it a squeeze. She looks back at the mirror. My friend Daniel seems confused, but the federal agent's face turn white as a sheet. He pulls out a phone and starts calling his superior.\n\n\"Listen to me, Diana.\"\n\n\"I never told you my name.\"\n\n\"Of all the ridiculous things I just said, that shouldn't be the worst. The reason why I'm involving you and everyone here is because I'm trying to expose my partner in crime. The more people know about her, the harder it is for her to erase her tracks and disappear. Will you listen?\"\n\n\"You have my undivided attention.\"\n\n\"Thank you, detective.\"\n\n\"What can you tell me about this partner of yours?\"\n\n\"Her preferred targets are men. She takes them, simply for the pleasure of tearing out of happiness in their hearts with her razor sharp teeth. I've seen her instill nightmares in men, leaving them weeping, gasping for air, making them call out her name. In her eyes, I see the ground and sky on fire, with no mercy at the end of days which she will bring. The blood of gods, fresh on her hands, with flaming wings and more eyes than I can count.\"\n\n\"This is hard to follow, Patrick.\"\n\n\"Fine. You want a description? She's beautiful. One look will take away your innocence, opening your mind to things you never could dream of before meeting her. She's a muse to anyone whose mind she breaks. Her hair is like fire, her skin like the porcelain of my grandmother's china set. Her eyes are greener than the leaves of summer. One look, and you'll know her name.\"\n\nThe federal agent returns to the room, phone still in hand, shocked. With a tremble in his hand and numbness in his mind, he tells Daniel of a plane crash just outside George Bush International.

It used to be goblinoids all over the continent, great cities from coast to coast and everything else in between. It was a dynasty so strong and with such willpower, they had a collective dream of the perfect empire. That dream still exists, not just through the Heirs of Dhakaan, but it exists as a physical manifestation in Dal Quor *to this day*. Kept alive by the Heirs, I'm sure. but it still exists nonetheless.\n\nThe Daelkyr came along and struck the very heart of this empire: their unity, their duty, their destiny. Yes, they fought and yes, they lost. Sealed away for thousands of years. The people whose minds they touched with their presence were driven mad and spread that madness like an infectious disease. A zombie apocalypse could have happened and this empire would still exist today. But the madness splintered everything these people were at their heart and soul.\n\nThe question is of course, why? And there generally isn't an answer. All we know is that they are still down in Khyber, trapped. Somewhat. Belashyrra may have been sealed in the Marches, but her creatures have started popping up in Xen'drik, fought by the Drow. Dyrrn was said to have been sealed in the Eldeen Reaches, but is popping up beneath the mountains of the Mror Holds. Orlassk lairs beneath the Great Crag in Droaam, with monstrous creatures like basilisks, gorgons and medusa all over the land (but don't tell the medusa that, they get pissy when you do).\n\nThe most disturbing aspect of the Daelkyr is the Draconic Prophecy and the Maze in Xoriat. The Maze, as a concept, is time. Walking through the maze is walking through time. The saying 'one door opens, another one closes' is a little more real here: taking one turn causes some things to happen on Eberron while other events are avoided. But is that you making a choice, is has the choice been made because a Prophecy was fulfilled or avoided on Eberron? Are you really in control here? In Exploring Eberron, the example given is that of a rat with a crown. Whatever holds that crown is the manifestation of the 'current' Eberron. The current rat might have stolen the crown from a different rat, which might represent the world of the Gith. That world could be restored, but not if the rat dies. The Daelkyr sometimes pick up rats, and mutate them. Change them. Then release them back in the maze.\n\nThis is a similar concept of the Great Wheel, where new versions of Eberron exist over and over again. One of the things known is that the concept of every plane exists, but when a new Eberron is created by the crown being claimed by a different rat, only 2 things stay the same: Xoriat and the Astral Plane. Everything else is gone. Or is it? If the crown is returned to the rat of the Gith, could that world exist again? Would it resume? Is time frozen there, until the crown is returned to the rat? What happens if a rat is resurrected and that rat is given the crown? What is the impact of these events on billions of lives?\n\nAnd if the Daelkyr are operating with the *knowledge* of the rats and the Maze, then that's cool and all, but *why did they invade*?\nIt's theorized that the Daelkyr don't just exist in one timeline, they exist in all timelines, from a single point of consciousness *at the same time*. They live in a world where your attack rolls was a crit, a hit and a miss. Where you failed your athletics check to grapple your opponent and failed it. The maze is some sort of manifestation of these experiences. A focusing lens for the ignorant eye. Certain things are sure to happen, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Maze is an experiment to see what happens if mortals are exposed to the reality of infinite Eberrons existing where everything is different, and what happens to those world where these events are set in stone.\n\nThe Maze, somehow, broadcasts its possibilities to the world. It manifests through dragonmarks, through billowing smoke, through the positions of the stars and moon. If you look hard enough, you can find it, as long as you know what to look for.\n\nIf we assume, just for a second, that the dragonmarks are created Daelkyr. That means that the currently established Dragonmarked Houses exist because of them. The Mark of Death was created by them as well, and indirectly, so was Lady Illmarrow. Prophecies have been uncovered because of these marks. The Isles of Farlnen, The War of the Mark, The Fall of Old Sharn, The Mourning, The Five Nations, The Last War.  \n\nWhat reasons can I imagine? They needed the Dhakaani Empire to cease to exist, as its magic (bardic and artifice) wouldn't be enough to stop some prophecy that was coming that the Daelkyr didn't want to directly interfere in. Or perhaps, once they had fully achieved their dream, the Prophecy would have died, as they would eliminate any sort of deviation in the future. Complete stability without possibility for something else happening. This would be a catastrophe for them. And so, several Daelkyr who were interested in Eberron volunteered to go and stay for a while. They brought company in the form of Beholders, Mindflayers and the like. They came, showed off, planted the seeds of madness then allowed themselves to be sealed underground to leave civilization be. They didn't leave because they needed to stay. To continue their drive to create and interact with the world they inhabited in a limited fashion, they did what they wanted: create for the sake of expressing themselves.\n\nThey did this to push this world in a different direction, because they weren't willing to lose this to stagnation. Somewhat similar to the meteor for the dinosaurs. The dominant species were exterminated and made space for a different one. And it's possible that now, the time is right. The dominoes started falling long ago, and they've been falling for a very long time. The butterfly effect, initiated by themselves, coming together in a masterpiece.\n\nAre the dragonmarks the key? Is Lady Illmarrow a magnum opus of sorts? Are the Daelkyr similar to the reapers, where they harvest the worlds they create and turn one creature into a Daelkyr to join the rest in a place beyond the stars? Is that what the Daelkyr are now, manifestations of past civilizations of Eberron? Could Dyrrn by the most recent, with his fascination with psionic magic like the Gith? Then who was the first? And the Daelkyr on Eberron at the moment are known to be the most powerful ones that are interested in Eberron, so what are the other ones still in Xoriat doing?\n\nAnd so on, and so on, and so on. There is very real potential for taking the world apart piece by piece, leaving the PC's questioning what is real and what isn't as everything unravels around. Some real cosmic horror stuff.\n\nI've never managed to put this in a game because I'd make the links very vague and it's also *really* out there. The Lords of Dust are my preferred one, as people tend to understand demons working towards bending a prophecy to a specific purpose a little better than literal chtulus mindfucking the planet they live on uncountable amounts of times, leaving everything else as dust in the stellar winds.\n\nI can go on and on about the Lords of Dust too.

It's been a while.\"\n\n\"It's been some time since we've seen each other. How are things?\"\n\n\"Well, I've been dating someone for a while. His name's Kevin. Doe eyed, green eyes, mop of hair, bundle of anxiety but a cute bunny of a guy. College is going well, my scores are good enough. Parents are doing ok.\"\n\n\"This is great, Kate. You're picking life back up again. After everything that's happened, it's really relieving to hear that you've managed all of this, and probably more. I'm proud of you. I hope you can be proud of yourself too.\n\n\"Thanks! Yeah, I've been doing pretty well. But, I've been sleeping poorly again. Not just sleepless nights. I see Daisy in my dreams again.\"\n\n\"Oh. I see. What can you tell me about these dreams?\"\n\n\"It's like sleep paralysis. I wake up in the middle of the night, and I can't move. Kevin's dead asleep and out of the corner of my eye, I see her standing by my bed. Staring at me. When it gets bad, she lies down next to me. Puts her head down right next to mine. Looks me right in the eye. For hours. I try to say something, every time. I want to tell her I was sorry. That I tried. That things didn't go the way I wanted.\"\n\n\"Kate, you moved heaven and earth for her. You all did.\"\n\n\"I just...I feel like if I had just been a split second earlier. Like, at some points, I hesitated, or waited and if I hadn't done any of that, maybe...maybe she'd still be here.\"\n\n\"Daisy took a massive risk. Everyone told her, including you. Without her charging his vanguard the way she did, she might not have fallen there. But then you wouldn't have had the opening you needed. She was an adult, she knew what she was doing.\"\n\n\"I know. I know, Doc. But it's just this feeling, this doubt, that just eats at me, in the back of my head.\"\n\n\"Daisy wouldn't want you to think of her like this. She trusted you and the rest to get the job done. And you did. The most powerful and ancient lich on the planet and you sent it to the void, together. Everything happened the way it did, there's nothing we can do anymore about her. The best respect we can pay to her, is use the lives that we have to do right by what she cared about.\"\n\n\"What if she's trying to warn us? Trying to warn me?

How are things?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, I&amp;#39;ve been dating someone for a while. His name&amp;#39;s Kevin. Doe eyed, green eyes, mop of hair, bundle of anxiety but a cute bunny of a guy. College is going well, my scores are good enough. Parents are doing ok.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is great, Kate. You&amp;#39;re picking life back up again.

I hope you can be proud of yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks! Yeah, I&amp;#39;ve been doing pretty well. But, I&amp;#39;ve been sleeping poorly again. Not just sleepless nights.

What can you tell me about these dreams?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s like sleep paralysis. I wake up in the middle of the night, and I can&amp;#39;t move. Kevin&amp;#39;s dead asleep and out of the corner of my eye, I see her standing by my bed. Staring at me. When it gets bad, she lies down next to me. Puts her head down right next to mine. Looks me right in the eye. For hours. I try to say something, every time. I want to tell her I was sorry. That I tried. That things didn&amp;#39;t go the way I wanted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kate, you moved heaven and earth for her. You all did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just...I feel like if I had just been a split second earlier. Like, at some points, I hesitated, or waited and if I hadn&amp;#39;t done any of that, maybe...maybe she&amp;#39;d still be here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daisy took a massive risk. Everyone told her, including you. Without her charging his vanguard the way she did, she might not have fallen there. But then you wouldn&amp;#39;t have had the opening you needed. She was an adult, she knew what she was doing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know. I know, Doc. But it&amp;#39;s just this feeling, this doubt, that just eats at me, in the back of my head.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daisy wouldn&amp;#39;t want you to think of her like this. She trusted you and the rest to get the job done. And you did. The most powerful and ancient lich on the planet and you sent it to the void, together. Everything happened the way it did, there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do anymore about her. The best respect we can pay to her, is use the lives that we have to do right by what she cared about.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What if she&amp;#39;s trying to warn us? Trying to warn me? Or maybe it&amp;#39;s Olocor, taking on her visage? To torture me from afar, unreachable by us.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We destroyed all teleportation sigils.

Some pick the road less travelled by.\n\n---\n\nA heavy set man sat down in a chair, unbuttoning his suit jacket. The rains were not merciful this night, as the gentle clattering on the windows surged with the winds. In the reflection, only a single light remained on, behind him, with the gentle glow of a mother's caress. His own reflection was barely visible. A silhouette, dark and broad, stared back at him.\n\nOn the thirty-fifth floor, the penthouse, he had been cooped up by orders of his superiors. Word had leaked on the streets of his arrival to those who knew of what haunted the scum of this city. Over the last month or so, gang associated murders have skyrocketed. Patterns stuck out so blatantly that it didn't feel a mob war of any kind. This was a calling card. Someone was looking for attention. The visceral and violent deaths now ran up to thirty-four as of yesterday, the number spread across three months with a rising amount over the last one.\n\nWhile a deep cleaning of the streets was not something regrettable in and of itself, the issue was that it was unsanctioned. Unsanctioned murders on the streets are unacceptable. The aggro a story like this could accumulate would blow open a tidal wave of misery the world had never faced, from which it couldn't recover.\n\nBy itself, this sounded like an exaggeration. If only it simply was.\n\nThe man had committed the thirty-fifth murder, same as the others. Painstaking details were replicated and no expenses were spared. The tearing wounds in the neck, in the middle of the night at the center of its territory. No cameras, no witnesses. Just a quick call, a gurgling gasp and the ripping of flesh. No blood on the scene. Last but not least, an invitation to the current location of the man who sat patiently.\n\n As he was about to check his watch, a knocking on the glass balcony door disturbed this. Outside stood a drenched woman in a raincoat, gazing through the door. The man got up, unlocked the door and held it open. She did not move in.\n\n\"So,\" She almost yelled with a raised voice, making herself heard as the winds swept the lashing rain without a care, \"this was you, right?\"\n\nHe gestured for her to enter, which she quickly did. As he closed the door, with one fell swoop, she unbuttoned her raincoat and moved to the door to hang it there. A braided ponytail came away from the hood, a leather jacket and jeans from under it. A stark contrast to the man's three piece suit.\n\nAfter leaving her coat on the rack, she looked him up and down.\n\n\"I don't appreciate people trying to take my gig.\"\n\n\"The Conclave does not appreciate your activities in this city, Miss...\"\n\n\"Call me Jean.\"\n\n\"Jean. Sure. Then I'm Logan.\"\n\n\"Subtle.\"\n\n\"Jean, you have the attention of those whose attention you don't want.\"\n\n\"Good. Took you guys long enough. Though I wouldn't have minded if you dropped by a little later.\"\n\n\"That would have gathered even more attention.\"\n\n\"As if the invitation wouldn't.\"\n\n\"We figured you were proud of your handiwork.\"\n\n\"Not really. Just a matter of convenience.\"\n\n\"Convenience? That's what blood banks are for.\"\n\n\"Listen, jar-head. Blood banks are for people who need that stuff in surgeries. I'm not taking blood from those who willingly give it. I'm taking it from those who don't deserve it.\"\n\n\"Who gave you the right to play judge, jury and executioner?\"\n\n\"Who gave you the right to intervene? Who watches the watcher?\"\n\n\"Those who understand the order of how things are better than you.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. No one ever really 'explained' any of this stuff. This whole mess only happened pretty recently. I'm new to all of it.\"\n\n\"Quite the mess, indeed. You have gained the attention of the masses. You target selection has left you in their good graces.\"\n\n\"I did more about the gang problem in one month than the police that's supposed to protect and serve us did in over a decade. Heh. I've done more noticeable and useful things for the place I was raised in in death than I did in life. I don't really plan on stopping.\"\n\n\"Very altruistic. The crusader who bloodies their hands so that others may stay clean. You're not the first to start out this way. I've seen it time and time again.\"\n\n\"Oh? How does it end?\"\n\nThe man pulled open his jacket on both sides. Dozens of tiny vials of holy water on one side and three stakes, one of iron, one of silver and one of wood on the other.\n\n\"Speaking of judge, jury and executioner.\"\n\n\"You know what these do?\" The man asked.\n\n\"I'm aware.\" The woman said, now a little more shaken.\n\n\"You're a recent convert. That's good. It means you can be reasoned with. For now. But your link to the void is strengthening. Soon, the hunger will consume you.\"\n\n\"The void?\"\n\n\"The darkness in your dreams that seeks to consume you. It stays its distance when you drink blood.\"\n\n\"What do you know about this?\"\n\n\"This 'Tobias' didn't tell you much about what you are, did he?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I will take on a new role, tonight. And if you take to the lessons I'm willing to teach you, we can discuss the mess you made and how to handle it.\"\n\n\"And if I don't?\"\n\n\"I'll handle you. You get two minutes to decide. That's more mercy than you gave the people you killed.\"\n\n\"Why do you get to decide who lives and who dies? What have you done to get to do that?\"\n\n\"I will explain, if you accept my offer.\"\n\n\"This doesn't feel fair.\"\n\n\"Life is unfair. Why does undeath have to be any different? The ones you put in the morgue didn't have a fair chance either. The scales will be balanced. One minute and thirty seconds. Choose, before a decision is made for you.\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have our ups and downs.

A silhouette, dark and broad, stared back at him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the thirty-fifth floor, the penthouse, he had been cooped up by orders of his superiors. Word had leaked on the streets of his arrival to those who knew of what haunted the scum of this city. Over the last month or so, gang associated murders have skyrocketed. Patterns stuck out so blatantly that it didn&amp;#39;t feel a mob war of any kind. This was a calling card. Someone was looking for attention. The visceral and violent deaths now ran up to thirty-four as of yesterday, the number spread across three months with a rising amount over the last one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While a deep cleaning of the streets was not something regrettable in and of itself, the issue was that it was unsanctioned. Unsanctioned murders on the streets are unacceptable. The aggro a story like this could accumulate would blow open a tidal wave of misery the world had never faced, from which it couldn&amp;#39;t recover.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By itself, this sounded like an exaggeration. If only it simply was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man had committed the thirty-fifth murder, same as the others. Painstaking details were replicated and no expenses were spared. The tearing wounds in the neck, in the middle of the night at the center of its territory. No cameras, no witnesses. Just a quick call, a gurgling gasp and the ripping of flesh. No blood on the scene. Last but not least, an invitation to the current location of the man who sat patiently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he was about to check his watch, a knocking on the glass balcony door disturbed this. Outside stood a drenched woman in a raincoat, gazing through the door. The man got up, unlocked the door and held it open. She did not move in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So,&amp;quot; She almost yelled with a raised voice, making herself heard as the winds swept the lashing rain without a care, &amp;quot;this was you, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gestured for her to enter, which she quickly did. As he closed the door, with one fell swoop, she unbuttoned her raincoat and moved to the door to hang it there. A braided ponytail came away from the hood, a leather jacket and jeans from under it. A stark contrast to the man&amp;#39;s three piece suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After leaving her coat on the rack, she looked him up and down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t appreciate people trying to take my gig.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Conclave does not appreciate your activities in this city, Miss...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Call me Jean.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jean. Sure. Then I&amp;#39;m Logan.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Subtle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jean, you have the attention of those whose attention you don&amp;#39;t want.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good. Took you guys long enough. Though I wouldn&amp;#39;t have minded if you dropped by a little later.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That would have gathered even more attention.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As if the invitation wouldn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We figured you were proud of your handiwork.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not really. Just a matter of convenience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Convenience? That&amp;#39;s what blood banks are for.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Listen, jar-head. Blood banks are for people who need that stuff in surgeries. I&amp;#39;m not taking blood from those who willingly give it. I&amp;#39;m taking it from those who don&amp;#39;t deserve it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who gave you the right to play judge, jury and executioner?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who gave you the right to intervene? Who watches the watcher?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Those who understand the order of how things are better than you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I suppose so. No one ever really &amp;#39;explained&amp;#39; any of this stuff. This whole mess only happened pretty recently. I&amp;#39;m new to all of it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Quite the mess, indeed. You have gained the attention of the masses. You target selection has left you in their good graces.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I did more about the gang problem in one month than the police that&amp;#39;s supposed to protect and serve us did in over a decade. Heh. I&amp;#39;ve done more noticeable and useful things for the place I was raised in in death than I did in life. I don&amp;#39;t really plan on stopping.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very altruistic. The crusader who bloodies their hands so that others may stay clean. You&amp;#39;re not the first to start out this way. I&amp;#39;ve seen it time and time again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh? How does it end?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The man pulled open his jacket on both sides. Dozens of tiny vials of holy water on one side and three stakes, one of iron, one of silver and one of wood on the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Speaking of judge, jury and executioner.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You know what these do?&amp;quot; The man asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m aware.&amp;quot; The woman said, now a little more shaken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re a recent convert. That&amp;#39;s good. It means you can be reasoned with. For now. But your link to the void is strengthening. Soon, the hunger will consume you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The void?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The darkness in your dreams that seeks to consume you. It stays its distance when you drink blood.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you know about this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This &amp;#39;Tobias&amp;#39; didn&amp;#39;t tell you much about what you are, did he?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then I will take on a new role, tonight. And if you take to the lessons I&amp;#39;m willing to teach you, we can discuss the mess you made and how to handle it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And if I don&amp;#39;t?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll handle you. You get two minutes to decide. That&amp;#39;s more mercy than you gave the people you killed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why do you get to decide who lives and who dies? What have you done to get to do that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will explain, if you accept my offer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This doesn&amp;#39;t feel fair.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Life is unfair. Why does undeath have to be any different? The ones you put in the morgue didn&amp;#39;t have a fair chance either. The scales will be balanced. One minute and thirty seconds. Choose, before a decision is made for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10py7je", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/10py7je/wpa_vampire_that_selectively_targets_drug_dealers/j6odnl4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/10py7je/wpa_vampire_that_selectively_targets_drug_dealers/", "name": "t1_j6odnl4", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WritingPrompts", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675193372.0, "created_utc": 1675193372.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/10py7je/wpa_vampire_that_selectively_targets_drug_dealers/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ubfw", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Dal Quor and The Mark of Death", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Eberron", "link_author": "UltimateKittyloaf", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6jjmjf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "HoneypuffCereal", "num_comments": 22, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10p9pe8", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_jnna5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; My players are really into the cosmology of Eberron.

Infiltration and espionage is what both Houses do. Their marks are Illusion and Divination based, which also aligns with what dreams and nightmares could be if they manifest on Eberron. A person with an Apex Mark of Shadow may very well be able to peer into the minds of those around them without effort and make them see what the wielder of the Apex Marks wants them to see. Perhaps even able to turn illusions into a reality by having Quori power these manifested illusions. Imagine what the Quori could do with an asset like that.\n\nHowever, one issues with this is that the Quori don't *need* either of these houses, as they maintain a spynetwork inside the dreams of the people they spy on. This cannot be tracked in Eberron, while the House's networks can inevitably lead back to them.\n\nInstead, the Quori might want to rely on something that has more physical prowess. Martial Prowess.

I mean, I see that there is some sort of corporate parody of 'creating the problem and the solution', but this appears to be on a scale where I'm not sure how serious this really is. Because it comes down to a business man working with a terrorist and then pushing a business proposal on the public of not one nation, but all of them, that cracks down on terrorism.\n\nWhich still leaves the issue of 'where are the non-sentient warforged coming from?' The creation forge in Old Sharn could be theirs, and House Cannith could investigate it and try to shut it down/reclaim it before the LoBster' followers could do the same. But you'd have these NS warforged walking around like mindless automatons in public, and with the current sentiment of Warforged as it is, very few people in power would accept this proposal until a the source of these automatons is verified to be legal. Which it isn't.\n\nYou might want to sit down and think reaaaaal hard on this one. Keep in mind, there was a point where Trask had blueprints and nothing else. If I were you, 'Trask' could, as an outcast, request an audience with the Twelve on this situation without the need of a cooperation with a terrorist.\n\nI'd make it so that 'De' has simply gone mad. Marks can do terrible things with people. Halas' family died when his mark manifested and was used. The entire village where the Lady of the Plague died when the same thing happened to her. Now it might happen again. What if this 'De' is going around, trying to get help for his mark but can't control its devastating power, then moves somewhere else and hopes it doesn't happen again. Somewhat like with Soldier Boy in the Boys season 4, whose chest laser fires off when he gets triggered by russian music and evaporates a building by accident, then forgets what happened.\n\nThen, as this wandering nuke goes around looking for help and to try to understand what is happening, 'Trask', with the best intentions, petitions the twelve to reach out to the five nations to reconsider the mandated shutdown of creation forges as he has plans for a new sort of warforged that is dedicated (and sentient, because this isn't DoFT, this is Eberron) to detecting AM's so that this issue, and other AM's in the general population, can be checked to secure the people of all nations.\n\nWhich the Twelve, rightfully, refuse as they believe the situation is handled. The Lanterns would then investigate these occurrences and try to stop them. You could pipe up that the Mourning might be reoccurring in the places of the mini nukes. Emphasis on might. Fear mongering works, I mean, look outside. All people have to say is that it happens and you can have a whole city up in arms while officials look to confirm it and settle people down.\n\nAnd _then_ you can have a witch hunt for AM's, and House Tarkanan's Charles Xavier speaking with the Twelve or whomever is willing to listen, that nation wide surveillance isn't the way and that a bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch.\n\nYou've got potential here with the notes you have. It can work really, really well. But if I can make a suggestion, don't make evil people do evil things for evil's sake. \n\n&gt; As for why more ADM are appearing, the Last War mentions that more and more have been popping up after the day of mourning. I was going to tie it to dragon shard dust being scattered during the morning and exposure to it. With enough exposure and catalyst(haven't figured out what yet) the mark would appear.\n\nDragon shards in dust form specifically? It could work, but the implication is that people are then more likely to acquire AM's in places where these are mined a lot, like in Q'Barra, Droaam, the Marches and in Xen'drik near Stormreach. Which would totally makes sense if this is the explanation for it. That way, your players could figure it out too once they put the clues together. Just keep in mind, those shards were being harvested in (most of) those locations before the Mourning happened.\n\nAs for the catalyst, it'd be a massive amount of stress like with mutants. Near dying levels of stress. Maybe people who get addicted to Dragon's Blood, that stuff that the hags import to Sharn, could massively increase the chance of getting one. \n\nIn that case, you'd have a reason for the terrorist attacks if 'De' is doing this on purpose, actually. But committing these acts across the nation, lots of people would get stressed out so bad, they would get marks. Maybe they want others to share their 'curse', or simply not be alone if they were rejected by House Tarkanan, and uses their name to make sure the House gets flak for their actions as revenge. Two birds with one stone.\n\n&gt; So what if he wasn't out in the open but was more of a zealot and secretly trying to wage a private war against the ADM? Have the parts from a forge stolen and relocated to a secret place and its not perfect, that's why their new warforged aren't sentient. So for now he only has small numbers of them. I would have some sort of detect magic item modified to look for marked people, specifically the unstable surges that can occurr.\n\nA Detect Magic/Good or Evil spell for these marks would make sense. So, why would 'Trask' wage a private war against the AM's? What would drive 'Trask' to commit this many resources to such a massive goal? Zealotry doesn't happen out of nowhere and doesn't _really_ work with a solid business attitude. AM's would have had to really hit 'Trask' at the core of their being to motivate them this much. Maybe a House Tarkanan member assassinated a loved one, and 'Trask' has investigated other occurrences of this happening. Maybe they see their loved one's body in their dreams, and a foul mark burnt onto their retina, glowing with the power that was used to murder.

If you Trask is already implementing this on a level where cities accept to monitor the populace, don't have them be drones, just have them be guards. Not specifically designed drones likes Trask has at the end of DoFP, but equipped with wands of Detect Aberrant Mark spells. The drones like that are the endgame, like the titans (which is a cool idea, but why titans? They're big enough to rival the Tarrasque and strength, hard to apply when fighting AM's. Food for thought later, I suppose). Maybe have the guards be of House Medani, House of Detection or Warforged soldiers who used to be spies or scouts. \n\nIf anything, I would specifically hire warforged to do this, as they are relatively cheap labor, respect organization, discipline and hierarchy through their indoctrination in the armies they served in.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the Trask equivalent has been working with the Magneto type(he could always falsely claim he&amp;#39;s house Tarkanan but use the name) for the past 6-9 months to cause lots of terrorist style attacks across the five nations, raising the fear level of the ADM&amp;#39;s from the general publics perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the guy who is piecing together a creation forge is hiring a guy with an AM to commit terrorist attacks and people then get afraid of AM&amp;#39;s, so the Trask type then makes partially functional warforged that scan for people with AM&amp;#39;s? I mean, I see that there is some sort of corporate parody of &amp;#39;creating the problem and the solution&amp;#39;, but this appears to be on a scale where I&amp;#39;m not sure how serious this really is. Because it comes down to a business man working with a terrorist and then pushing a business proposal on the public of not one nation, but all of them, that cracks down on terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which still leaves the issue of &amp;#39;where are the non-sentient warforged coming from?&amp;#39; The creation forge in Old Sharn could be theirs, and House Cannith could investigate it and try to shut it down/reclaim it before the LoBster&amp;#39; followers could do the same. But you&amp;#39;d have these NS warforged walking around like mindless automatons in public, and with the current sentiment of Warforged as it is, very few people in power would accept this proposal until a the source of these automatons is verified to be legal. Which it isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might want to sit down and think reaaaaal hard on this one. Keep in mind, there was a point where Trask had blueprints and nothing else. If I were you, &amp;#39;Trask&amp;#39; could, as an outcast, request an audience with the Twelve on this situation without the need of a cooperation with a terrorist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d make it so that &amp;#39;De&amp;#39; has simply gone mad. Marks can do terrible things with people. Halas&amp;#39; family died when his mark manifested and was used. The entire village where the Lady of the Plague died when the same thing happened to her. Now it might happen again. What if this &amp;#39;De&amp;#39; is going around, trying to get help for his mark but can&amp;#39;t control its devastating power, then moves somewhere else and hopes it doesn&amp;#39;t happen again. Somewhat like with Soldier Boy in the Boys season 4, whose chest laser fires off when he gets triggered by russian music and evaporates a building by accident, then forgets what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, as this wandering nuke goes around looking for help and to try to understand what is happening, &amp;#39;Trask&amp;#39;, with the best intentions, petitions the twelve to reach out to the five nations to reconsider the mandated shutdown of creation forges as he has plans for a new sort of warforged that is dedicated (and sentient, because this isn&amp;#39;t DoFT, this is Eberron) to detecting AM&amp;#39;s so that this issue, and other AM&amp;#39;s in the general population, can be checked to secure the people of all nations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which the Twelve, rightfully, refuse as they believe the situation is handled. The Lanterns would then investigate these occurrences and try to stop them. You could pipe up that the Mourning might be reoccurring in the places of the mini nukes. Emphasis on might. Fear mongering works, I mean, look outside. All people have to say is that it happens and you can have a whole city up in arms while officials look to confirm it and settle people down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you can have a witch hunt for AM&amp;#39;s, and House Tarkanan&amp;#39;s Charles Xavier speaking with the Twelve or whomever is willing to listen, that nation wide surveillance isn&amp;#39;t the way and that a bad apple doesn&amp;#39;t spoil the bunch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve got potential here with the notes you have. It can work really, really well. But if I can make a suggestion, don&amp;#39;t make evil people do evil things for evil&amp;#39;s sake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for why more ADM are appearing, the Last War mentions that more and more have been popping up after the day of mourning. I was going to tie it to dragon shard dust being scattered during the morning and exposure to it. With enough exposure and catalyst(haven&amp;#39;t figured out what yet) the mark would appear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dragon shards in dust form specifically? It could work, but the implication is that people are then more likely to acquire AM&amp;#39;s in places where these are mined a lot, like in Q&amp;#39;Barra, Droaam, the Marches and in Xen&amp;#39;drik near Stormreach. Which would totally makes sense if this is the explanation for it. That way, your players could figure it out too once they put the clues together. Just keep in mind, those shards were being harvested in (most of) those locations before the Mourning happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the catalyst, it&amp;#39;d be a massive amount of stress like with mutants. Near dying levels of stress. Maybe people who get addicted to Dragon&amp;#39;s Blood, that stuff that the hags import to Sharn, could massively increase the chance of getting one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In that case, you&amp;#39;d have a reason for the terrorist attacks if &amp;#39;De&amp;#39; is doing this on purpose, actually. But committing these acts across the nation, lots of people would get stressed out so bad, they would get marks. Maybe they want others to share their &amp;#39;curse&amp;#39;, or simply not be alone if they were rejected by House Tarkanan, and uses their name to make sure the House gets flak for their actions as revenge. Two birds with one stone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what if he wasn&amp;#39;t out in the open but was more of a zealot and secretly trying to wage a private war against the ADM? Have the parts from a forge stolen and relocated to a secret place and its not perfect, that&amp;#39;s why their new warforged aren&amp;#39;t sentient. So for now he only has small numbers of them. I would have some sort of detect magic item modified to look for marked people, specifically the unstable surges that can occurr.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Detect Magic/Good or Evil spell for these marks would make sense. So, why would &amp;#39;Trask&amp;#39; wage a private war against the AM&amp;#39;s? What would drive &amp;#39;Trask&amp;#39; to commit this many resources to such a massive goal? Zealotry doesn&amp;#39;t happen out of nowhere and doesn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; work with a solid business attitude. AM&amp;#39;s would have had to really hit &amp;#39;Trask&amp;#39; at the core of their being to motivate them this much. Maybe a House Tarkanan member assassinated a loved one, and &amp;#39;Trask&amp;#39; has investigated other occurrences of this happening. Maybe they see their loved one&amp;#39;s body in their dreams, and a foul mark burnt onto their retina, glowing with the power that was used to murder. Maybe someone used their mark irresponsibly and crippled them, forcing them to use some sort of exo suit to walk around. Or maybe they were taught to hate marks, which would suggest it&amp;#39;s something generational, the source being family trauma, stigma or community perception.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The forge could be pieced together somewhere remotely (make note to yourself where it is, and think of a way that a paper trail can be investigated to see how the parts were shipped, to what location and when.

First of all, props to you for doing the work, good luck and have fun!\n\n&gt; I'm starting with a Days of future past vibe, with the number of aberrant dragonmarks climbing and people getting afraid of them.\n\nWhen it comes to the 'vibe' that you're establishing here, I'm assuming it's the part where mutants strike out to prevent the architect of death machines that run rampant but accidentally cause it instead. You may want to keep this in mind, but your players might take these core components that you've laid and the general direction and flip it on its head. Be prepared to have this deviate a couple of ways. \n\nThere is a generally well established reason for why people are scared of Aberrant Dragonmarks (AM) concerning their history during the War of the Mark. But why are AM's popping up more recently? What is the trigger that causes this? Something is pushing this forward, willingly or randomly. Maybe it was the Mourning and the break of reality that also causes the Fey Spires to be unable to return to Thelanis? Or was it the Daelkyr, pushing for a destabilization of civilization all over again, but this time to finish off all of Eberron to prepare it for the next cycle of their planetary experiment? Maybe it is a plot of an Overlord or their prakhatu, following the directions of the Prophecy to unleash evil not seen since the Age of Demons? \n\nWhere did this come from, and if this was done on purpose, then what purpose does the increased number of AM's serve? Prepare an answer, or multiple, and let your players investigate this if they feel like it. But always ask *why* something is happening.\n\n&gt; A powerful and well connected merchant (who is also an excoriated house cannith member) has convinced people that after recovering the pieces, to re-open one creation forge to make new, but non-sentient warforged to help deal with the problem. (Eventually he wants to rebuild titans and all to reclaim land in his houses name.)\n\nBy the Treaty of Thronehold, what he is advertising is the equivalent of a federal offense. The creation forge supposedly operational in Old Sharn is not at work in the Cannith Enclave because they were shut down as part of the peace accords to end the Last War. Using one openly is bound to get you wined and dined in the equivalent of the International Court of the Hague. Operating one out in the open is an invitation to get agencies like the King's Lanterns to make this guy disappear into their holding cells, waterboard them about how they would accomplish this, then petrify him and stick him in the Dreadhold. Powerful? Well connected? Sure. Former member of House Cannith? Those don't really go well together, not with the weight of the name Cannith. It could be a secret, sure. Maybe he's a bastard of Merrix Senior. But the fate of former house members isn't allowed by the standing houses to be associated with success. That would breed sedition in their own ranks, and the splitting of House Phiarlan and House Thuranni was done not lightly. But if you *do* want to be successful, how does he accomplish this in the current political landscape? What did he do to be powerful and well connected? What caused his separation from power? Why has House Cannith allowed him to operate at the level that he does? And where does he get the resources from to not only build a creation forge but to eventually scale up his production to rebuild the Titans? Plenty of questlines for a party of adventurers to follow up, but how would he do this if the party didn't help?\n\nAnd what will the current, sentient warforged do? So some guy out there advertises that he has a warforged that only makes non-sentient warforged? If I were them, I'd be absolutely pissed. This guy gets the right to do what he wants with a creation forge, but the sentient warforged who get treated like slaves but with less than minimum wage get to see their numbers get smaller and smaller every year, while brainless variants of themselves get mass-produced. The warforged cannot reproduce, but these brainless, soulless husks get to exist because it suits the Houses' purpose? I can imagine the Lord of Blades telling the enclave there to wrestle control of the forge from this merchant, and if that's not possible, to destroy it. The LoBster seems like the kind of guy to feel that if he can't have a creation forge, then no one should.\n\nKeep in mind, they mass produced sentient warforged because the brainless ones they made in the past had limited application. Think of the AI that produces art these days, they always get the number of teeth and finger wrong. But by adding souls to the warforged, they became massively successful products of House Cannith and the face of the Last War, despite being active in it for about 30 out of 98 years or so.\n\n&gt; There of course will be a group of ADM's who are more violent, lead by a descendant of house Tarkanan who want to either take over a city and eventually more in the name of superiority.\n\n\"Of course\". Why? How? When? The DoTF equivalent of Magneto, I'm assuming. Magneto suffered at the hands of people who 'followed orders' and vows to never let that happen again to the people he considers to be equal to himself, the mutants. Who is this leader? What reason does this Descendant (De) have for choosing violence over the path to peace, like Charles Xavier would walk? Part of what makes the conflict between the mutants so interesting is opposing mindsets of their charismatic, well-meaning leaders and the consequences of that actions and interaction with each other but also everyone else around them, as well as how those consequences shape the future of the mutants and the world they live in.\n\nA descendant from House Tarkanan? It's not a real House, Halas had no children known of. He died over a thousand years ago, having a direct lineage after that time will make this descendant as related to him as an average person in Asia to Genghis Kahn. Perhaps just an agent that split off for philosophical reasons. \n\nWhy does 'De' take over a city and/or more? Superiority? The right of the strong over the weak? Well, it's a good calling card for the adventurers to come in and kick ass, but it's also shortsighted and breaks the status quo. The Houses won't stand for it. Perhaps they hire the party to go and kill 'De', as they like the status quo as is and don't want it to get messed up because some dude who shoots lightning out of their hands believes that because he can do that, he can do whatever they want. That's a massive target on their backs. The brightest flames burn out the fastest. But how is 'De' going to maintain rule over a city? How will they rule? Will they fumble? Will they be sabotaged or framed for things they didn't do? I'd say, look deeper into this. A desire to rule like this should be more than just 'haha im a bad guy im going to rule the world', I'll leave that for my saturday morning cartoons.\n\n&gt;  The opening is the party on a lightning rail that gets stopped by some of these new warforged and a guard searching for aberrant marks (the whole party gets one at character creation) and them deciding how they want to deal with it, fight on a crowded train, comply, or flee.\n\nThe last part I'm a big fan of, as it pushes the world onto the player characters for them interact with it in an exciting and interactive way, so props for coming up with it, it's solid. That said, how do the guards check for it? Full body scans? Is there a detector? Is it an identity card type of deal? AM's can spontaneously manifest, does the entire population get check ups? In order for these checks to take place, there would probably need to be government level approval for these checks to be allowed on the general populace, because some corporation can't just decide that for themselves. They'd need permission, maybe not from the government, but from House Orien who operates the lightning rail. But why would they let that happen? They have nothing to gain from it, unless those scans also pick up some king of private data that they store in databases that they then sell to the highest bidder. Back to the AM situation though, it'd be some sort of Big Brother is Watching You type of situation. If it does, then the government has a good reason for such an invasive attitude to AM detection. Have their been attacks associated with a lot of them? Your players might bring up the argument against the guards checking them that being checked is against their rights as citizens on the Five Nations and that they refuse to cooperate on the grounds of it being unlawful to be searched. Establishing stuff like this might allow you to push it on them that these searches are required for a reason. _But what is the reason?_\n\n&gt; The Lord of blades is super pissed about the creation forge being reopened and he and his loyal warforged attempt to either take it or destroy it.\n\nAlready commented on this, good idea. I'd have the players be exposed to this, as you'd quickly have multiple factions: The merchant and his drones, Lobster and the warforged and the AM's with 'De'. All with reasons to fight one another or ally with one another. Maybe the LoBster's minions hire 'De' and their AM soldiers to destroy the forge, setting off the start of the main plotline where your party can either save the engine and fight off the AM's, or destroy the forge and fight off the drones. Or maybe the merchant plants evidence of the warforged working against the AM's, incurring the wrath of 'De'. Does the party aid one faction, the other, or work to expose the truth?\n\n\n---\n\nTBC", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, I&amp;#39;ll take take a crack at what you have. First of all, props to you for doing the work, good luck and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting with a Days of future past vibe, with the number of aberrant dragonmarks climbing and people getting afraid of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the &amp;#39;vibe&amp;#39; that you&amp;#39;re establishing here, I&amp;#39;m assuming it&amp;#39;s the part where mutants strike out to prevent the architect of death machines that run rampant but accidentally cause it instead. You may want to keep this in mind, but your players might take these core components that you&amp;#39;ve laid and the general direction and flip it on its head. Be prepared to have this deviate a couple of ways. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a generally well established reason for why people are scared of Aberrant Dragonmarks (AM) concerning their history during the War of the Mark. But why are AM&amp;#39;s popping up more recently? What is the trigger that causes this? Something is pushing this forward, willingly or randomly. Maybe it was the Mourning and the break of reality that also causes the Fey Spires to be unable to return to Thelanis? Or was it the Daelkyr, pushing for a destabilization of civilization all over again, but this time to finish off all of Eberron to prepare it for the next cycle of their planetary experiment? Maybe it is a plot of an Overlord or their prakhatu, following the directions of the Prophecy to unleash evil not seen since the Age of Demons? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where did this come from, and if this was done on purpose, then what purpose does the increased number of AM&amp;#39;s serve? Prepare an answer, or multiple, and let your players investigate this if they feel like it. But always ask &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something is happening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A powerful and well connected merchant (who is also an excoriated house cannith member) has convinced people that after recovering the pieces, to re-open one creation forge to make new, but non-sentient warforged to help deal with the problem. (Eventually he wants to rebuild titans and all to reclaim land in his houses name.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the Treaty of Thronehold, what he is advertising is the equivalent of a federal offense. The creation forge supposedly operational in Old Sharn is not at work in the Cannith Enclave because they were shut down as part of the peace accords to end the Last War. Using one openly is bound to get you wined and dined in the equivalent of the International Court of the Hague. Operating one out in the open is an invitation to get agencies like the King&amp;#39;s Lanterns to make this guy disappear into their holding cells, waterboard them about how they would accomplish this, then petrify him and stick him in the Dreadhold. Powerful? Well connected? Sure. Former member of House Cannith? Those don&amp;#39;t really go well together, not with the weight of the name Cannith. It could be a secret, sure. Maybe he&amp;#39;s a bastard of Merrix Senior. But the fate of former house members isn&amp;#39;t allowed by the standing houses to be associated with success. That would breed sedition in their own ranks, and the splitting of House Phiarlan and House Thuranni was done not lightly. But if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to be successful, how does he accomplish this in the current political landscape? What did he do to be powerful and well connected? What caused his separation from power? Why has House Cannith allowed him to operate at the level that he does? And where does he get the resources from to not only build a creation forge but to eventually scale up his production to rebuild the Titans? Plenty of questlines for a party of adventurers to follow up, but how would he do this if the party didn&amp;#39;t help?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what will the current, sentient warforged do? So some guy out there advertises that he has a warforged that only makes non-sentient warforged? If I were them, I&amp;#39;d be absolutely pissed. This guy gets the right to do what he wants with a creation forge, but the sentient warforged who get treated like slaves but with less than minimum wage get to see their numbers get smaller and smaller every year, while brainless variants of themselves get mass-produced. The warforged cannot reproduce, but these brainless, soulless husks get to exist because it suits the Houses&amp;#39; purpose? I can imagine the Lord of Blades telling the enclave there to wrestle control of the forge from this merchant, and if that&amp;#39;s not possible, to destroy it. The LoBster seems like the kind of guy to feel that if he can&amp;#39;t have a creation forge, then no one should.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, they mass produced sentient warforged because the brainless ones they made in the past had limited application. Think of the AI that produces art these days, they always get the number of teeth and finger wrong. But by adding souls to the warforged, they became massively successful products of House Cannith and the face of the Last War, despite being active in it for about 30 out of 98 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There of course will be a group of ADM&amp;#39;s who are more violent, lead by a descendant of house Tarkanan who want to either take over a city and eventually more in the name of superiority.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course&amp;quot;. Why? How? When? The DoTF equivalent of Magneto, I&amp;#39;m assuming. Magneto suffered at the hands of people who &amp;#39;followed orders&amp;#39; and vows to never let that happen again to the people he considers to be equal to himself, the mutants. Who is this leader? What reason does this Descendant (De) have for choosing violence over the path to peace, like Charles Xavier would walk? Part of what makes the conflict between the mutants so interesting is opposing mindsets of their charismatic, well-meaning leaders and the consequences of that actions and interaction with each other but also everyone else around them, as well as how those consequences shape the future of the mutants and the world they live in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A descendant from House Tarkanan? It&amp;#39;s not a real House, Halas had no children known of. He died over a thousand years ago, having a direct lineage after that time will make this descendant as related to him as an average person in Asia to Genghis Kahn. Perhaps just an agent that split off for philosophical reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why does &amp;#39;De&amp;#39; take over a city and/or more? Superiority? The right of the strong over the weak? Well, it&amp;#39;s a good calling card for the adventurers to come in and kick ass, but it&amp;#39;s also shortsighted and breaks the status quo. The Houses won&amp;#39;t stand for it. Perhaps they hire the party to go and kill &amp;#39;De&amp;#39;, as they like the status quo as is and don&amp;#39;t want it to get messed up because some dude who shoots lightning out of their hands believes that because he can do that, he can do whatever they want. That&amp;#39;s a massive target on their backs. The brightest flames burn out the fastest. But how is &amp;#39;De&amp;#39; going to maintain rule over a city? How will they rule? Will they fumble? Will they be sabotaged or framed for things they didn&amp;#39;t do? I&amp;#39;d say, look deeper into this. A desire to rule like this should be more than just &amp;#39;haha im a bad guy im going to rule the world&amp;#39;, I&amp;#39;ll leave that for my saturday morning cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The opening is the party on a lightning rail that gets stopped by some of these new warforged and a guard searching for aberrant marks (the whole party gets one at character creation) and them deciding how they want to deal with it, fight on a crowded train, comply, or flee.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last part I&amp;#39;m a big fan of, as it pushes the world onto the player characters for them interact with it in an exciting and interactive way, so props for coming up with it, it&amp;#39;s solid. That said, how do the guards check for it? Full body scans? Is there a detector? Is it an identity card type of deal? AM&amp;#39;s can spontaneously manifest, does the entire population get check ups?
