Hackers are just 21st century con men. Computers communicate with each other, and when you have a computer you can control exactly what it communicates. Computers only know what they're programmed to know, they only react how they're programmed to react.\n\nWeb pages are clients that are programmed and then delivered to and rendered through your web browser, and web sites are server applications built to respond to the data sent from the client. Your computer acts as the client, running the web page you requested, and transmits information to the web server, running the server application the web page is communicating with.\n\nWell, the programmer builds the web page, and they put forms for data in it (Like what is your username and password?), and when used appropriately, the server application should operate just fine. The problem is the client can manipulate any information going to the server that they want, and often the server never validates that the information coming through to it is legitimate.\n\nLet's say I've built a simple web site and web page that acts as a simple addition calculator for you. So my web page has two number pads, one on the left and one on the right, and a button at the bottom that says \"Add!\". So let's select \"2\" on the left, and \"5\" on the right, and hit the button. Now your web browser takes this information from the web page, and transmits it to the web server, and the web server runs the application adding the two numbers together, and communicates the result of \"7\" to you through another web page. Well, that's great... it works... but what happens when we lie to it?\n\nLets now create our own client, and instead of having two number pads, let's create two text fields! Now instead of selecting \"2\" on the left, and \"5\" on the right, let's type in \"John\" on the left and \"Doe\" on the right. When we communicate this information to the server, what's it going to do? Our application only knows numbers, but now we've received two words! Because I didn't program the application to check for words, it's going to attempt to add them together, and [this kills the application.](http://i.imgur.com/P9EAQ.jpg)\n\nNow, this example isn't that bad. Sure, it breaks the application and it's techincally a hack, but what about a banking web application? Your online bank probably allows you to transfer money to an account, what happens if you try and transfer 100,000 when you only have $2.04? What about when you try to transfer -50,000,000,000 from Bill Gates (He won't miss it) account? If the programmer didn't make the application verify that the proposed transfer balance is between $0.01 and your balance of $2.04, it'll probably go through!
