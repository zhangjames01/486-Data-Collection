Rather than dealing some potential damage(1), and then wait and be of no use for almost 30seconds. Or I can distract the enemy tank so my allies can damage it further. \nAlso, if you&amp;#39;re exposing yourself for too long, either with the 76mm or the 90mm, you&amp;#39;re doing it wrong..\nAt engagements from medium-long distances, the 76mm outpaces the 90mm when you consider the aim-time.  76mm has a 2,11s aim time with 100% crew, vents and BiA which is perfect for rapidly emptying the revolver. 90mm has 2,66s aim time, which means waiting for the magical aim sound every time, and that adds up to 2,2seconds more to empty the drum. 76mm is already starting it&amp;#39;s reload by the time the 90mm has stopped firing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1: The worse aim-time and what-seems-like-a-RNG-nightmare and weird bounces doesn&amp;#39;t hurt either, right? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But hey, I&amp;#39;m not saying using the 90mm is wrong!
