I've dropped ~25lbs at this point myself after countless failed attempts before. My big change this time is I found something that worked for me, and I've stuck with it. Yes, CICO matters. People love to sing the praises of counting every single calorie. But frankly, it didn't work for me. I don't have the patience to constantly put every single thing I eat on a food scale. I hated doing the math for every recipe. I eat out often enough that it was hard to know exactly what I was consuming calorie-wise every single time to log it. So I didn't try this time. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I am **aware** of how many calories I'm consuming now more than I ever was before, but I don't log them. The Perfect Bar I eat for breakfast sometimes? 330 calories. The clif bar alternative? 250. My favorite takeout option for lunch? 800-1200 depending on what I get. It doesn't get logged in MFP or any other app. I have a mental log of what I've eaten for the day and do the math mentally. Is it a perfect system? No. Could it be better? Absolutely. But does it work for me? **Yes** and that's what matters.\n\nSomething else I changed was snacking. I have terrible self control. If I buy a box of Oreos to have a sweet treat around, I can't just eat two. I'll eat two. Then two more. And maybe an extra after that. Same with corn nuts. Love the salty crunchy little devils. Can I eat just a handful? Nope. I eat one, then a second, and maybe a few more. But you know what I can do? I can avoid them entirely by simply not buying them. I don't have the self-control to eat reasonable portions, but I do have the self-control and willpower to avoid buying them when I go to the store. So that's what I do.\n\nThe same applies for exercising. I bought a stationary bike in Nov 2020 after my doctor said I needed to exercise more for the millionth time. I hate running. Absolutely despise it. I don't want to rely on doing things outdoors for exercise. It's too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. It was an excuse not to do it. And I hate (the idea of) the gym. I've admittedly never set foot in one. But I do not want to exercise around people. I don't want anyone watching me, despite all the reassurance in the world that nobody is or that nobody is judging me. True or not, I just don't want to do it. So I bought the bike. It's something I can do in the privacy of my home on my schedule. But there's more to it. I had plenty of false starts with that too. When I first got it, I was trying to do 30 mins 6x per week. It was too much. I burned out so fast. I would be good for a few weeks and then one missed day here or there ruined it because I enjoyed the days off so much more. Or I would get frustrated when my heart rate wouldnt get \"high enough\" (or as high as I thought it should/wanted it to be). But again, I found something different this time. I lowered the resistance on my bike. I had it way too high before. I would truly feel the burn in my legs. This time, resistance is way down. I don't necessarily feel the burn anymore, but my heart rate still gets up there (135-140+ BPM on an \"average\") day. I'm back to doing 6x per week. I don't beat myself up if I miss a day on occasion. I don't beat myself up if my heart rate doesn't get as high as I want. Instead, I'm doing it for me because I know it's the right choice for my health rather than feeling like I'm obligated to do it. \n\nOne more thing to add - you don't have to go crazy trying to exercise more to burn a ton of calories either. I rode my stationary bike for 30 minutes today at a 43km/hr pace. According to my Galaxy watch, I burned 344 calories in those 32 minutes. I also went for a walk to get my 10,000 steps in. I walked for about an hour and ten minutes, went a total of 4.3 miles, and I burned 498 calories. I still don't love riding my stationary bike, but I tolerate it. The walk though? Even though it was 24 degrees, it was **SO** much more tolerable and enjoyable for me. And it burned more calories! Sure, it took longer to do it, and my average heart rate was 26 bpm lower. But it works for me. It's sustainable. I can go out and do it tomorrow and the day after and every day without feeling burnt out. I can ride my bike 6 days a week now, but I still have my days where I dread it and wish I could skip it.\n\nSo ultimately, find what works for you and your husband. If he can't eat veggies? Okay. Don't try and force a ton into his diet immediately. Maybe try a green smoothie with some spinach or kale along with some fruit to make it sweet. Need to consume fewer calories in general? Avoid the things you might mindlessly snack on like I did. When I don't have those unhealthy snacks, I tend to just avoid snacking overall. Maybe one meal a day would work for you guys. Or maybe diligently counting calories is what you need. Nobody here can tell you what will work for you. We can all give you countless suggestions. You might have to try a ton of different things before you find what works, and that's okay. It's a process that will take time. \n\nA couple of final comments:\n\n* It helps to have someone or some way to keep yourself accountable. I've gotten into the habit of posting pictures/screenshots of my workout results on my Snapchat and Instagram stories. The same ~15-20 people view them every day. Almost nobody has said anything beyond the one occasion where I said I was officially down 25 lbs. But I still feel more accountable because of it. Whether or not anyone would care or say anything if I missed a couple of days in a row, who knows. But it still helps. \n\n* Consider investing in a fitness tracker or smartwatch. I got a Galaxy Watch 4 from my family, and it's an immense help for me. It helps me accurately track my total calories burned throughout the day. It's 8:30pm here now, and the Samsung Health app is saying I've burned 2400 calories total. I know that I've consumed fewer calories than that which is what counts. Whether it's 100 calories fewer or 1000 fewer isn't hugely important. A deficit is a deficit. Sure, I'd love to have a 1000 calorie deficit every day and watch the pounds melt off. But I enjoy food. I ate fried chicken and fries Popeyes for dinner. Are there better options out there? Sure. But indulging on occasion won't ruin my progress. I enjoyed my chicken tonight. I'm not going to go crazy trying to spend extra time exercising tomorrow. I'll ride my bike for 30 minutes and go for a walk to try and get my 10k steps in, same as I did today. I'll weigh myself when I wake up. The number maybe higher than it was today, and that's also fine. As long as it doesn't creep up day after day after day, I know I'm doing fine. \n\nBest of luck to you and your husband! I hope you can find something that works for you.\n\n**Tl;Dr:** nobody can tell you exactly what will work best for you. Yes, CICO matters. Yes, exercising helps.
