I wasted a lot of time, money and effort figuring that out.\n\nThey can heat treat their entire home at once and effectively treat everything, ridding it of bedbugs: mattresses, beds, pillows, bedding/sleeping bags, furniture, jackets, all types of laundry carpets and shoes, suitcases, cabinets, light fixtures (not that bedbugs would typically be anywhere other than where the people are, but I suppose it's technically possible that a traveling bedbug could come from a different apartment and perhaps end up in a light fixture, so it's nice that heat treating one's home treats all the spaces and even the insides of mattresses).

You'll wind up having to try something else after wasting time and letting the fuckers breed more and grow the infestation.\n\n**Don't bother with the bed bug bombs/foggers you see at the hardware store**. They are not a strong enough poison to be effective. Bugs like bed bugs and fleas have become resistant to a lot of the common poisons we've long used to fight them.

Indeed, I went and read reviews for every bug bomb/fogger that's available at nearby stores, and soooo many people wrote that they were super pissed because it didn't get rid of their bed bugs. And a lot of the over the counter hardware store bug bombs make you put stuff in a bag with the poison and leave it for days. And it still doesn't work. Many reviews said people tried it once, it didn't work, so then they tried really hard and left stuff in bags with poison for a week or more, determined to make it work. But still it didn't work.  \n\nMy **heat treatment (with industrial poison spray afterwards because I was desperate to end the nightmare) was effective immediately**. They haven't come back and I got zero more bites. It was expensive, but very worth it. I wish I hadn't thrown any of my stuff away and filled my home with that stupid DE powder.

Indeed, I went and read reviews for every bug bomb/fogger that&amp;#39;s available at nearby stores, and soooo many people wrote that they were super pissed because it didn&amp;#39;t get rid of their bed bugs. And a lot of the over the counter hardware store bug bombs make you put stuff in a bag with the poison and leave it for days. And it still doesn&amp;#39;t work. Many reviews said people tried it once, it didn&amp;#39;t work, so then they tried really hard and left stuff in bags with poison for a week or more, determined to make it work. But still it didn&amp;#39;t work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;heat treatment (with industrial poison spray afterwards because I was desperate to end the nightmare) was effective immediately&lt;/strong&gt;. They haven&amp;#39;t come back and I got zero more bites. It was expensive, but very worth it. I wish I hadn&amp;#39;t thrown any of my stuff away and filled my home with that stupid DE powder. I&amp;#39;m glad I read reviews of people saying that the bed bug foggers don&amp;#39;t work before I wasted time and money on that ineffective step. Best of luck to OP&amp;#39;s coworker!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_tbu6ke", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/whatsthisbug/comments/tbu6ke/pulled_this_off_a_coworker_who_pointed_it_out_on/i0ag5ie/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/tbu6ke/pulled_this_off_a_coworker_who_pointed_it_out_on/", "name": "t1_i0ag5ie", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whatsthisbug", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1647032846.0, "created_utc": 1647032846.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 150, "id": "award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c670b7d7bc99c03bffde92706ad5ceeda12658f3", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=63a498673bd4a518a031783179a767cc4135d5f5", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e8802df47965bd66370b72ac3cb7639e9eae92ae", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fc40ae1c1a18193f190da70a2748d0a48c17a5a9", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=77ba4d8e862ca183dd8c09e002fd123a6b2f52f5", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Thank you stranger.
