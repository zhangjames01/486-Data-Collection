There are many tricks that a telco/isp could do to get the maximum bandwidth out of their connections. The problem is that that requires someone to physically update the tower hardware (most cell phone towers in America run on 20 year old tech as it is).\n\nTo get an idea of the tricks you can do with broadcasting just look at radio. Today your typical radio station broadcasts an analog signal, an analog information signal (feeds the info display on older car radios), and as many as 3 different digital broadcast signals, all on the same carrier wave. Admittedly a cell phone carrier wave holds many more broadcasts, one for each phone operating on a frequency, but realize that telco's have unfettered access to a radio frequency spectrum that spans gigahertz in size (compared to a few megahertz for radio), and they are at the prime frequencies for carrying data (telco's get consideration even over our military in this respect). Telco's do nothing to exploit their prime spot on the airways despite their lock down on the high end of the radio frequency spectrum. The reason why is that any upgrades made also benefits any competition that might be using the same tower. IE: Sprint runs on Verizon towers. So if Verizon upgrades then Sprint receives the same benefit from it. Verizon does not want Sprint to have the same service quality so Verizon chooses not to upgrade. It's the old telephone pole argument going on, just with cell phone towers. \n\n&gt;Yeah my post is most definitely inaccurate. I would love for someone to chime in with the theoretical limits of LTE.\n\nFirst realize that the telco's only use a handful of the frequencies they control.

Please don't expect 100% accuracy in the above as I am a bit rusty with the info and if someone who is currently working as a station tech could give better info than I it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nEdit: The analog info signal mentioned above plays under the normal radio broadcast and is NOT a separate signal.
