The Monday that they did a controlled release from the rail cars, the leading story on the evening local news was a cop shot in McKeesport or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11uqb16", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/pittsburgh/comments/11uqb16/promoscow_voices_tried_to_steer_ohio_train/jcr9zb0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/11uqb16/promoscow_voices_tried_to_steer_ohio_train/", "name": "t1_jcr9zb0", "author_flair_template_id": "490833b8-d53c-11e1-9a88-12313d168e98", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pittsburgh", "author_flair_text": "Brighton Heights", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679181389.0, "created_utc": 1679181389.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://apnews.com/article/ohio-train-derailment-russia-disinformation-twitter-musk-49af27699727d6f4157a5d6d5f35819b"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhrn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Pro-Moscow voices tried to steer Ohio train disaster debate", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "pittsburgh", "link_author": "MycologistQueasy22", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcr9675", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "just_an_ordinary_guy", "num_comments": 166, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcq38lk", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_cju1a", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "People wondering why they haven't heard about it but only get their news from social media.
