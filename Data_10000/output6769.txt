Yeah, a few things that follow kinda irk me, but it's not that big of a deal. Like the OP said, the first episode has this interaction between Old White Intelligence Officer and Hot Young Fresh Stronk Brown Woman. It includes the stuff he's detailed, but that's pretty much where that shit stops.  I can't think of another time when it is so hamfistedly shoved into a scene, though I might have missed an instance.  There's a character who ticks off the Separatist Militia boxes without being white nationalist.  I thought that was kinda funny that they didn't go there, considering everything else that gets said. The character has a military career that matches that of a Republican Ex-President, and if you're paying attention you'll get the reference right away when it comes up.  The refreshing part of the story, by my estimation, is that it doesn't make the mistake of turning all the white males into villains.  In fact, the three villains in the show feature a Hispanic male, a disabled white male, and a white female. The heroes are a white male, a nerdy white male, and a Persian female.  It makes for a nice balancing act and doesn't venture any deeper into race relations than what I've mentioned above.
