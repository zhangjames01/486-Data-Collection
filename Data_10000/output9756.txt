I've been friends with this girl since I was in elementary school. I started to have feelings for her in middle school and got friendzoned, you know the story. In high school she got a lot more popular than me and we sort of drifted apart, I resented her a lot at first but as I matured I started to realize that I was really just putting her on a pedestal and I might not have been the \"nice guy\" that I thought I was.\n\nSo we started talking again recently (both just graduated from the same high school class of 2012) and I went into it not really expecting a whole lot. Anyways she invited me to the end of the year party she was having at her place (her dad was out of town but knew she was having a party and is pretty cool with the drinking and whatnot) so I went. I didn't really know most of her friends so it was kind of awkward and I don't drink either but she was being really flirty with me. I wrote it off as her just being drunk rather than having a rekindled interest in me but she kept at it all night.\n\nNow this is the important part-- I had my wisdom teeth removed right before the school year ended and the hydrocodone I was administered was giving me serious constipation, so I had been taking suppositories to relax my bowels at this point. I was starting to feel gassy and sick and so I was a little antsy to leave. The party was sort of winding down and I wanted to say goodbye before I went but a few of her friends were still there and I was a little nervous about interrupting being the outsider that I was (and even more nervous about using her toilet), so I waited around some more.\n\nI guess I sort of was anticipating something to come out of it if I said goodbye to her alone, but I honestly would have preferred it to happen when she was sober. Once the last people were leaving she started putting her hands all over me and being really forward. She promised that she wasn't that drunk but I don't think it was true. She took me back to her bedroom and started taking her clothes off and even though I knew it was wrong I also knew we probably wouldn't see each other after this summer and I would regret missing an opportunity to finally lose my virginity to this girl I'd had feelings for for so long. We started making out on her bed and I got really flatulent at this point, but she was too loud and drunk to really notice. I finished pretty quickly and she sort of rolled over. It was an unpleasant experience, but I think that's normal for most people's first time and she really didn't make me feel too embarrassed so I felt okay about it. I ended up sleeping over- it was just something I had really wanted for a long time, to hold her in my arms through the night.\n\nOnce the night was over, that's when things got fucked up. I woke up literally covered in shit. I knew immediately it was the laxatives. There was gunky diarrhea all over the bedspread, all the way up my thighs and all over he back since we'd been spooning all night. She was still crashed out asleep at this point, and I just sat on the edge of the bed covered in my own feces crying for like five minutes. I went to her bathroom and showered myself, but after getting dressed I acknowledged that there was no way in hell I could get all the shit off of those sheets.\n\nI know this is gonna make me look like an asshole but I fucking panicked at this point, Reddit. I did the only thing I could think of doing: I scooped up a small pile of poo with my hands, pulled the covers back, and smeared it on her bare asscheeks. I went into the kitchen, washed my hands, found a notepad and a pen and left her a little message by her bedside that read you shit yourself last night so i left. And then I booked it the fuck out of there.\n\nI don't know what I expected to happen really. I just didn't want her to blame me for the shit, I would have felt more pathetic than I already did. But it's been five days now and I haven't heard from her at all, I tried calling twice and she hasn't responded. I'm worried as fuck, Reddit. I don't know what to say because I don't know whether she's too embarrassed to speak to me or worse if she thinks that I did it. On top of that the fact that she got drunk and had sex with me. Seriously, I need fucking help. Advice from anyone who's fucked up during a one-night stand. I want to fix things, but I don't want to embarrass her or incriminate myself. Thanks in advance, I'll keep you guys updated.
