And you don't need to buy an entire rig to make what you already have a gaming PC. \n\nBut rather than have you take my word for it, [here it is straight from the horse's mouth](http://www.pcgamer.com/there-are-711-million-pc-gamers-in-the-world-today-says-intel/):\n\n&gt; &gt; \"There are 711 million PC gamers in the world today, that's one in ten people on the planet\" - Kirk Skaugen, Intel Senior Vice President\n\n[Hell, Steam alone has had over 100 million active since September of last year.](http://store.steampowered.com/news/14478/)\n\nI have no idea how much it's grown since then, but according to [this press release from yesterday](http://store.steampowered.com/news/16000/), it's clearly not showing any signs of slowing down.\n\n&gt;Regular folk just want a box that plays shit and can stream video and music that's all. \n\nWell... not entirely. Regular folks also want PCs to use for...you know.... personal computing... But I'm not arguing against the notion of wanting something that just works, although you seem to think I am somehow.\n\nAll I'm saying is that eventually, if W10 is meant to integrate Xbox more, and MS wants to phase out the concept of a console(which they *really* should), as we've described in the hypothetical, then a normal PC, which is objectively more cost effective, vastly better performing, and vastly more capable than any console, even as it stands now, could be purchased with W10, and be used as an Xbox One.\n\nFrom your perspective as a \"regular folk\", all you would have to do is buy a prebuilt PC with W10 installed already and a decent CPU for *maybe* $300 total, and then a GPU that blows either console out of the water for *maybe* $100, and then you pop it into the PCIe port in the PC, which is literally the only port it can fit into. W10 should theoretically just grab the newest drivers automatically, so you don't need to do anything further, other than connect a controller to it so it goes into XBO mode. \n\nBoom! You just got something that operates just like an XBO, but is many times more powerful.\n\nThat's the end result I'm getting at.\n\n&gt;Only enthusiast and hard core PC gamers really care about building a rig.\n\nHold up. You just loaded the crap out of that statement.\n\nFirst, I never said you needed to built an entire rig. As I just said, you can just buy a prebuilt PC on the cheap, and pop in a new GPU, which takes all of 30 seconds, and has the same level of difficulty as popping in a flash drive into a USB port.\n\nSecond, building one is *not* just for enthusiasts or hard core PC gamers. I don't know who filled your head with this nonsense, but it's honestly a bit ridiculous.\n\nNot only is building one *way* cheaper, but you also get *way* more for you money. And it *seriously* isn't difficult. I can't stress that enough. It's trivial.\n\nIt's also not hard picking out the parts if you *did* want to  build your own rig. Just go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds#wiki_the_next-gen_crusher), and you'll find a list of parts hand picked for your convenience to get the best performing parts for the cheapest possible price, while sticking around $400. And there's even a link there to take you to buy the parts.\n\nPeople who would rather build their rig than buy a prebuilt PC usually just don't want to get some overpriced device, and they've got about 30 minutes to spare when the parts come in. They don't even need a technical background.\n\nI've got a friend who needed to run some simulation software, so he came to me to build him a PC. I asked him what his budget was, popped that into ChooseMyPC.net, and handed him the link for the parts. A little while later, the parts came in, and one of the parts even came with a color coded guide on how to put everything together.

When they come out, their hardware does not change. That's what makes them consoles. Because of this, PCs in the same price range of the consoles immediately outperform them, and have more capabilities than them because of their more flexible operating systems, and better and cheaper hardware that comes out year after year.\n\nYou are essentially posed with a question:\n\n&gt;Which is better? A PC that can be used as an XBO? or an XBO that can be used as a PC?\n\nand the answer is quite clear. The PC can do literally everything the XBO can and then some, in addition to being cheaper and more powerful, and can also be upgraded. But the XBO can only do a small portion of what a PC can do, and it can never be improved hardware-wise.\n\nNow, I'm guessing you are going to go back to the PC not being something you can put in your living room, but here's the kicker:\n\nMS has said that they want Windows 10 to automatically adjust its UI to whatever input method you are using. That means the UI meant for mouse/keyboard will be designed like a desktop PC's UI should be, and the UI for touch/pen input should be designed like a tablet's UI should be.\n\nSo when you use an XBO controller with your W10 PC, you'll be effectively getting an XBO's UI. Or hell, MS could just put something in the settings called \"Xbox One Mode\".\n\nSo which would you rather have?\n\nAn actual $500 XBO that can sort of emulate some PC features?\n\nor\n\nA $500 PC that is twice as powerful as an XBO, with all the features of both a PC and an XBO?\n\nYou could pretty much just pop the PC in your living room, and call it an XBO, but have way better graphics, resolution, and framerate.\n\nOf course, that change isn't just going to happen overnight. But late adopters aren't going to buy just the XBO. They'll buy the PC that they can use as an XBO but with way more capabilities.\n\n**Does that mean \"Xbox\" is going to die off? Not necessarily.**\n\nIt simply means the name \"Xbox\" may have to change what it's defined as. It could even just be a family of games that you pay a subscription to play online using the Azure back end (and the other Gold benefits), much like why you pay for XBL now.\n\n**If \"Xbox\" *did* die off, is that a bad thing? Of course not.**\n\nMicrosoft owns both the Xbox platform and the Windows platform. If Xbox goes away, that doesn't mean games like Halo would disappear forever, or you won't have your XBL friends anymore.

When they come out, their hardware does not change. That&amp;#39;s what makes them consoles. Because of this, PCs in the same price range of the consoles immediately outperform them, and have more capabilities than them because of their more flexible operating systems, and better and cheaper hardware that comes out year after year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are essentially posed with a question:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which is better? A PC that can be used as an XBO? or an XBO that can be used as a PC?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and the answer is quite clear. The PC can do literally everything the XBO can and then some, in addition to being cheaper and more powerful, and can also be upgraded. But the XBO can only do a small portion of what a PC can do, and it can never be improved hardware-wise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m guessing you are going to go back to the PC not being something you can put in your living room, but here&amp;#39;s the kicker:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MS has said that they want Windows 10 to automatically adjust its UI to whatever input method you are using. That means the UI meant for mouse/keyboard will be designed like a desktop PC&amp;#39;s UI should be, and the UI for touch/pen input should be designed like a tablet&amp;#39;s UI should be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when you use an XBO controller with your W10 PC, you&amp;#39;ll be effectively getting an XBO&amp;#39;s UI. Or hell, MS could just put something in the settings called &amp;quot;Xbox One Mode&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So which would you rather have?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An actual $500 XBO that can sort of emulate some PC features?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A $500 PC that is twice as powerful as an XBO, with all the features of both a PC and an XBO?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could pretty much just pop the PC in your living room, and call it an XBO, but have way better graphics, resolution, and framerate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, that change isn&amp;#39;t just going to happen overnight. But late adopters aren&amp;#39;t going to buy just the XBO. They&amp;#39;ll buy the PC that they can use as an XBO but with way more capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that mean &amp;quot;Xbox&amp;quot; is going to die off? Not necessarily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It simply means the name &amp;quot;Xbox&amp;quot; may have to change what it&amp;#39;s defined as. It could even just be a family of games that you pay a subscription to play online using the Azure back end (and the other Gold benefits), much like why you pay for XBL now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If &amp;quot;Xbox&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; die off, is that a bad thing? Of course not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Microsoft owns both the Xbox platform and the Windows platform. If Xbox goes away, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean games like Halo would disappear forever, or you won&amp;#39;t have your XBL friends anymore. It just means those developers will shift to develop for Windows 10, and you&amp;#39;ll use the W10 Xbox app for friends and parties and the like.

easy enough for Xbox to copy Sony's *policies*. In the Settings app, they could put in a checkbox somewhere that you can tick to opt in to allowing others to record/stream your voice, and other checkboxes for what you want to stream with(maybe you do/don't want your own voice, and maybe you do/don't want in-game/party voices).\n\nThe issue is that it's *far* more than just creating a few checkboxes with some text next to them.\n\nThe XBO must have a system for handling voice audio so game developers can work with it to do things like proximity voice chat, team chat, squad chat, etc. And party chat is an entirely separate chat environment too.\n\nBut to handle these various scenarios, it can take quite a bit of coordination and code, both of which take plenty of time and money.\n\nThe Game DVR, obviously, is a separate entity from streaming, so not everything can be just lumped together.\n\n[Consider the following:](http://i.imgur.com/3B6qsAK.gif)\n\nYou want to stream your gameplay footage, and the voices of other players, but not your own. But remember, you can't stream the voices of people who have opted into allowing others to stream/record *their* voice. And of course, the Game DVR would still just record game audio with no voices.\n\nHow does the XBO handle it? How does the Game DVR app handle it? How does Twitch handle it? What resources do each of these things have available to them?\n\nThe Game DVR app is a simple enough one to figure out. \n\nThe XBO itself, on a system level, would simply pass the game OS's video and audio output into the encoder, where the last 5 minutes are stored in a cache until the user wants to record a slice of it, and that slice is copied from the cache into a separate video that is stored on a hard drive.\n\nBut what about Twitch?\n\nLet's say to simplify things, streaming apps, like Twitch, are given access to the video and audio feed from the actively running game. They are allowed to access the output from the encoder, just as the Game DVR app is. This gives them the properly encoded packets that are *way* more appropriate and easy to manage for streaming than the raw video/audio output. And once they have that, they simply need to also slap on any voice audio they would normally slap on, and it can be streamed to Twitch.\n\nBut what about voices?\n\nWell, our theoretical has it so you don't want your own voice in your own broadcast, which is fine. But if you *did*, the Twitch app would need access to your voice feed, right? So the XBO would have to offer that resource to it if you wanted this.

In the Settings app, they could put in a checkbox somewhere that you can tick to opt in to allowing others to record/stream your voice, and other checkboxes for what you want to stream with(maybe you do/don&amp;#39;t want your own voice, and maybe you do/don&amp;#39;t want in-game/party voices).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more than just creating a few checkboxes with some text next to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The XBO must have a system for handling voice audio so game developers can work with it to do things like proximity voice chat, team chat, squad chat, etc. And party chat is an entirely separate chat environment too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to handle these various scenarios, it can take quite a bit of coordination and code, both of which take plenty of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Game DVR, obviously, is a separate entity from streaming, so not everything can be just lumped together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/3B6qsAK.gif\"&gt;Consider the following:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to stream your gameplay footage, and the voices of other players, but not your own. But remember, you can&amp;#39;t stream the voices of people who have opted into allowing others to stream/record &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; voice. And of course, the Game DVR would still just record game audio with no voices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does the XBO handle it? How does the Game DVR app handle it? How does Twitch handle it? What resources do each of these things have available to them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Game DVR app is a simple enough one to figure out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The XBO itself, on a system level, would simply pass the game OS&amp;#39;s video and audio output into the encoder, where the last 5 minutes are stored in a cache until the user wants to record a slice of it, and that slice is copied from the cache into a separate video that is stored on a hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about Twitch?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say to simplify things, streaming apps, like Twitch, are given access to the video and audio feed from the actively running game. They are allowed to access the output from the encoder, just as the Game DVR app is. This gives them the properly encoded packets that are &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more appropriate and easy to manage for streaming than the raw video/audio output. And once they have that, they simply need to also slap on any voice audio they would normally slap on, and it can be streamed to Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what about voices?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, our theoretical has it so you don&amp;#39;t want your own voice in your own broadcast, which is fine. But if you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;, the Twitch app would need access to your voice feed, right? So the XBO would have to offer that resource to it if you wanted this. The app, however, would need to work with an API, developed and provided by Xbox, that was built into the XBO&amp;#39;s OS, in order to access that resource.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, with &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people&amp;#39;s voices, there would have to be such an API, and the XBO would have to offer such a resource.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The catch here, is that your XBO, since it has the voice audio feeds from every other player that you would normally hear, would have to assume that no one&amp;#39;s voice can be recorded or streamed, and then it would have to have a list of the people who have opted &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; to having their voice recorded/streamed by other people.
