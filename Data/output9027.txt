nightmare, having to brush your skin against another person!!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;yeah, it sucks, but if you think it&amp;#39;s any more pleasant for her - you&amp;#39;re stupid.  it&amp;#39;s humiliating, embarrassing, and just plain depressing to be trying desperately to squish yourself into as small of a space as possible and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; fail.  &amp;quot;she should do something about it, then&amp;quot; - well yeah, she probably should.  sure, being fat can represent a lack of self-control and personal health endangerment.  so does being a smoker, a drinker, a drug addict.  the difference is that you don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;wear&lt;/em&gt; your smoker-ness, alcoholism, or drug addictions out on a big sign that everyone else can see and judge.  she wears her weakness in a place where absolutely everyone can see, and (unless she doesn&amp;#39;t give a shit about inconveniencing others or endangering her own health) it&amp;#39;s most assuredly not pleasant for her.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;shame on you for shaming her.  as if there aren&amp;#39;t humiliating things in your life that you simply are able to hide from everyone.  what if we found those things, took pictures, posted them on the internet?  how would you feel?  what would you think?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;this is not wtf worthy, it belongs in first world problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: i do not disagree that she should buy an extra ticket.  my point is this is not wtf-worthy, this is not a &amp;quot;nightmare&amp;quot;, and that publicly shaming people for a weakness that they probably already feel self-conscious about is not useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award":
