And let me call your attention to one specific feature of this calculation: in the expression x^(y/z), you _first_ divide y by z to get some number, _then_ take x to the power of that number, whereas in the expression z-root(x^(y)), you _first_ take x to the power of y, _then_ take it to the power of 1/z (which is just another way of expressing z-root). It's doing things in a different order. And as you might know from other parts of math, you can't always switch around the order in which things happen and get the same result - for example, (x - y) - z is very different from x - (y - z)!\n\n**Optional further reading**\n\nThis all traces back to the idea of [_multivalued functions_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivalued_function), which is a topic in math that one could learn a lot more about in an upper-level college class (complex analysis). I know the phrase \"multivalued function\" is a bit of an oxymoron because a function is normally _defined_ as something that gives at most one output for any given input, so you might want to think of \"multivalued function\" as meaning something that kind of looks like a function but that could give any of several equally valid outputs for certain inputs, so in order to turn it into a real function you have to build in a strategy for picking one of the possible outputs.\n\nThe best known example is, of course, the square root function. If you were a mathematician in ye olde days and you wanted to try to define the square root as the inverse of squaring, then you would think about it like this: given a number A, what other number can I square to get A? Well, as you know, if A &gt; 0, there are two such numbers, which means that the inverse of squaring is a multivalued function. In order to make a proper function out of it, we need a strategy for picking one of those two numbers. In this case, it's reasonably straightforward because one of the numbers is always positive and the other is always negative, so the strategy can be as simple as \"pick the positive one\", and presto, you have the function that we call the \"square root function\". Of course, you could have taken the strategy to be \"pick the negative one\", and then you'd have a different function. Or you could have taken a more complicated strategy that picks positive numbers for some inputs and negative numbers for other inputs, and that would give you a valid function, but it'd be a really difficult function to work with because it wouldn't be [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function) or have a number of other useful properties.\n\nThings get more complicated when you try taking the square root of a negative number - or I should say, when you try to figure out what number, squared, gives you A if A is negative. You know that there are no _real_ numbers that satisfy that criterion, which is why mathematicians invented complex numbers. But when you're inventing a whole new dimension of numbers, the familiar ideas of \"positive\" and \"negative\" no longer apply. I mean, sure, there are two (complex) numbers whose square is -1, and you can even prove that they are arithmetic opposites of each other (i.e. adding them together gives you zero, just as adding a positive real number to the corresponding negative real number gives you zero), but there isn't one of them that clearly sticks out as the more \"natural\" one to pick for your square root function. Now, that's not a problem; all we have to do is pick one arbitrarily - we call it i, of course - and then we can go on and define the square root function on negative numbers as that particular arbitrarily-chosen one of the two values whose square is a given negative number. But the point is, the nice \"obvious\" rule used in defining the square root function on _positive_ numbers doesn't work in every case; a lot of times it's an arbitrary choice.\n\nThe same kind of thing happens with other roots, like 3-root or 4-root, but with different amounts of \"multivalued-ness\". Like, if you examine the inverse operation of taking the 3rd power, you'll find that given an original number A, there are _three_ values whose 3rd power is A. And there are four values whose 4th power is A. And so on. There's a pattern to them for positive arguments, when A &gt; 0: one of the values is always a positive real number; if the power is even, another of the values is a negative real number; and the rest are complex non-real numbers. (There's a nice graphical explanation for this, basically that the roots are evenly spaced around a circle; see e.g. [Wikipedia's article on roots of one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity) if you're curious.) Mathematicians have defined the z-root function so that when you apply it to a positive number, it picks the root which is also a positive number, but like I tried to show above, these choices are kind of arbitrary, and there are always other values that can often satisfy the same equations just as well. When you're doing exponent math, it pays to remember those other values.\n\nComing back to the examples you were looking at, here's my point. When you calculate 4-root((-2)^(2)), the way we've _conventionally_ defined the 4-root function, it refers to the positive real number x that satisfies x^(4) = (-2)^(2) = 4. But there are _three other numbers_ that also satisfy the equation x^(4) = 4:\n\n- -sqrt(2) = -1.4142... (a negative real number)\n- sqrt(2)i = 1.4142... i (a non-real complex number)\n- -sqrt(2)i = -1.4142... i (a non-real complex number)\n\nIf we had defined the 4-root function differently, its output could have been any of those three. And if you use complex arithmetic to calculate the other three expressions you listed, then you will find that their values could be either sqrt(2)i or -sqrt(2)i. So there is some sense in which all four of these _do_ have the same result, or at least they have some results in common - those results just happen to be non-real complex numbers. The only thing special about the last expression, 4-root((-2)^(2)), is that it has an extra \"level\" of squaring in it compared to all the others; it corresponds to the power equation x^(4) = 4, instead of x^(2) = -2 as the other expressions do. That extra \"level\" of squaring happens to give it an extra set of solutions that the other equations don't have.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": " point", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, that is accurate.

In order to make a proper function out of it, we need a strategy for picking one of those two numbers. In this case, it&amp;#39;s reasonably straightforward because one of the numbers is always positive and the other is always negative, so the strategy can be as simple as &amp;quot;pick the positive one&amp;quot;, and presto, you have the function that we call the &amp;quot;square root function&amp;quot;. Of course, you could have taken the strategy to be &amp;quot;pick the negative one&amp;quot;, and then you&amp;#39;d have a different function. Or you could have taken a more complicated strategy that picks positive numbers for some inputs and negative numbers for other inputs, and that would give you a valid function, but it&amp;#39;d be a really difficult function to work with because it wouldn&amp;#39;t be &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function\"&gt;continuous&lt;/a&gt; or have a number of other useful properties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things get more complicated when you try taking the square root of a negative number - or I should say, when you try to figure out what number, squared, gives you A if A is negative. You know that there are no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; numbers that satisfy that criterion, which is why mathematicians invented complex numbers. But when you&amp;#39;re inventing a whole new dimension of numbers, the familiar ideas of &amp;quot;positive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; no longer apply. I mean, sure, there are two (complex) numbers whose square is -1, and you can even prove that they are arithmetic opposites of each other (i.e. adding them together gives you zero, just as adding a positive real number to the corresponding negative real number gives you zero), but there isn&amp;#39;t one of them that clearly sticks out as the more &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; one to pick for your square root function. Now, that&amp;#39;s not a problem; all we have to do is pick one arbitrarily - we call it i, of course - and then we can go on and define the square root function on negative numbers as that particular arbitrarily-chosen one of the two values whose square is a given negative number. But the point is, the nice &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot; rule used in defining the square root function on &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; numbers doesn&amp;#39;t work in every case; a lot of times it&amp;#39;s an arbitrary choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same kind of thing happens with other roots, like 3-root or 4-root, but with different amounts of &amp;quot;multivalued-ness&amp;quot;. Like, if you examine the inverse operation of taking the 3rd power, you&amp;#39;ll find that given an original number A, there are &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; values whose 3rd power is A. And there are four values whose 4th power is A. And so on. There&amp;#39;s a pattern to them for positive arguments, when A &amp;gt; 0: one of the values is always a positive real number; if the power is even, another of the values is a negative real number; and the rest are complex non-real numbers. (There&amp;#39;s a nice graphical explanation for this, basically that the roots are evenly spaced around a circle; see e.g. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_of_unity\"&gt;Wikipedia&amp;#39;s article on roots of one&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;#39;re curious.) Mathematicians have defined the z-root function so that when you apply it to a positive number, it picks the root which is also a positive number, but like I tried to show above, these choices are kind of arbitrary, and there are always other values that can often satisfy the same equations just as well. When you&amp;#39;re doing exponent math, it pays to remember those other values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coming back to the examples you were looking at, here&amp;#39;s my point. When you calculate 4-root((-2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the way we&amp;#39;ve &lt;em&gt;conventionally&lt;/em&gt; defined the 4-root function, it refers to the positive real number x that satisfies x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = (-2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4. But there are &lt;em&gt;three other numbers&lt;/em&gt; that also satisfy the equation x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 4:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;-sqrt(2) = -1.4142... (a negative real number)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sqrt(2)i = 1.4142... i (a non-real complex number)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;-sqrt(2)i = -1.4142... i (a non-real complex number)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we had defined the 4-root function differently, its output could have been any of those three. And if you use complex arithmetic to calculate the other three expressions you listed, then you will find that their values could be either sqrt(2)i or -sqrt(2)i. So there is some sense in which all four of these &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have the same result, or at least they have some results in common - those results just happen to be non-real complex numbers. The only thing special about the last expression, 4-root((-2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is that it has an extra &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; of squaring in it compared to all the others; it corresponds to the power equation x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 4, instead of x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -2 as the other expressions do. That extra &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; of squaring happens to give it an extra set of solutions that the other equations don&amp;#39;t have.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11utozy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/theydidthemath/comments/11utozy/request_this_has_always_bothered_me_why_doesnt/jcs8xm4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/11utozy/request_this_has_always_bothered_me_why_doesnt/", "name": "t1_jcs8xm4", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/theydidthemath", "author_flair_text": "7\u2713", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679198321.0, "created_utc": 1679198321.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/fhbtfrxelkoa1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0y", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "New to Python.

It's not even a complicated calculation if you're used to the equations involved - I basically just multiplied a bunch of things together. Here's a bit more detail about what I did, in case it helps:\n\n- Dunno if this is obvious, but [angular size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter) is a measure of how big something appears when you're looking at it (or, in this case, when a telescope is looking at it). For example, the whole sky is 360 degrees \"across\". Half the sky is 180 degrees across. The moon is about one degree across. This particular image is 2.2 arcminutes across, and an arcminute is 1/60 of a degree, so the whole image is showing a patch of sky about 1/30 as wide as the full moon would appear to us on Earth.\n- You can think of the angular size of the image as a cone with its point at your eye (or, at the telescope's sensor) and extending out toward whatever you (or the telescope) are looking at, getting wider as it goes further away. Check out the diagram in the Wikipedia article I just linked. So, given that something has a certain angular size, the further away it is, the bigger it actually is. If you know the angular size and the distance, you can calculate the actual size of the thing by multiplying the angle (in radians - see [XKCD 2748](https://xkcd.com/2748/)) by the distance. (Or more precisely, multiplying the sine of half the angular size by the distance and then by two, but for small angular sizes, those are pretty much the same.)\n- I found that the black hole-like feature was 1/100 the size of the whole image by just downloading it and measuring pixels :-)\n- I happen to know that the closest star to Earth, other than the sun, is [Proxima Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri) which is about 4.2 light years away. So I figured it should be fairly uncontroversial that we have a pretty comprehensive knowledge of any star-sized things within 5 light years of Earth. (Realistically, the same statement holds true for a much larger distance, maybe a few hundred light years, but 5 ly is enough to make my point.)\n- Given the angular size of the black hole-like feature (1/100 of 2.2 arcminutes, or 0.022 arcminutes, or 0.00037 degrees, or 0.0000064 radians) and the hypothetical minimum distance (5 light years, or 47,000,000,000,000 km), I can multiply those two numbers together and get about 300 million kilometers. I found it easier to express that as 2 AU; an [AU (astronomical unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit) is a unit of length that is pretty nearly equal to the radius of [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)'s orbit around the sun, by definition. That means the _radius_ of the accretion disc is half of that, or 1 AU, or 150 million km.\n- Now, the thing that you see in images of black holes is the accretion disc, which is all the assorted cosmic junk that's falling into the black hole itself. The actual black hole is, of course, smaller than the accretion disc, so in this case, that means it's smaller than 1 AU in radius. How much smaller? I dunno, but I guessed it's something like a tenth the size. I could be wrong; maybe it's actually half the size; maybe it's actually 1/100 of the size. But I'll just go with 1/10 for now and then figure out how much it matters later. (See also [XKCD 2205](https://xkcd.com/2205/)) So if we're supposing that the black hole is 1/10 the size of the accretion disc, that makes it 0.1 AU in radius, or 15 million km.\n- There's a well-known formula that relates the mass of a non-rotating [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) to its radius: r = 2GM/c^(2), where r is the radius, M is the mass, G is the [universal gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant) (6.674\u00d710^(\u221211) m^(3)/kg/s), and c is the [speed of light](299,792,458 m/s). If I plug in 15 million km for the radius and solve for M, I get (15,000,000 km \u00d7 (299,792,458 m/s)^(2) / (6.674\u00d710^(\u221211) m^(3)/kg/s) / 2) which is 10^(37) kilograms. The [sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun)'s mass is 2\u00d710^(30) kg, so that black hole would be five million times the mass of the sun. (I had forgotten the factor of 2 from r=2GM/c^(2) in my previous comment; now edited.) Now, to be fair, if this object were a real black hole it _would_ be rotating, and that changes the formula a little bit, but not by a huge factor - it's still r=(something)GM/c^(2), where the (something) might be as low as 1. So the five million solar masses is not too far off on that account.\n- Then, as I mentioned, I had looked up the mass of the largest known black hole in our galaxy, the one at the center, and found it to be about 4.2 million solar masses. So this hypothetical black hole would be larger than that.\n\nOf course, there were some places where I made guesses about various numbers, so how far off could I be if those guesses were wrong? Well, the \"worst\" case scenario, the one that gives the hypothetical black hole the smallest possible mass (and the best chance of having been undetected) is this:\n\n- The black hole could be closer than 5 light years, say e.g. 2.5 light years. But that might actually make it _easier_ to detect because it would have a stronger gravitational effect on the planets in our own solar system, so it really can't be too close. This contributes an extra factor of 2.\n- The accretion disc could be as much as 100 times the size of the black hole. I'm guessing that it wouldn't be more than that; that guess is partly based on intuition and what I've heard about black holes, and partly based on the idea that there just isn't much stuff around Earth and the nearby stars to form an accretion disc out of. This contributes an extra factor of 10.\n- If the black hole is rotating, that would actually make the calculated mass _larger_, so the theoretical worst-case scenario there is that it's not spinning.\n\nSo if my calculation is off in the \"wrong\" direction, it probably wouldn't be off by more than a factor of 20. Running through the same calculation with a distance of 2.5 light years and an accretion disc 100X the size of the black hole gives 1/20 of the final result, or 250,000 solar masses. In that case it wouldn't be the largest black hole in the galaxy, but it would still be an absolutely tremendous object with a huge gravitational effect, very close to our solar system. It's hard to imagine how that could exist without us knowing about it. (Or more likely, it would have repeatedly fried the Earth with radiation and we wouldn't even be here.)\n\nIf you're curious about this and anything is still unclear, feel free to ask, I will be happy to explain!
