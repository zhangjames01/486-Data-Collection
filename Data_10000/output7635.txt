I'm not into social media and don't take selfies often, but there was an intense urge in me and I took a bunch of pics of him.. it was weird because I never do that.\n\nBut god he was a beautiful man and I never stopped loving him. We ended up in bed and the sex was very dark and full of needs. I could feel his pain inside, I could feel his torment. I put out soothing vibes and it calmed him.

I was SO worried but that was it, he hung up on me and stopped taking my calls. \n\nA couple weeks later I got a call from his parents.

Addiction is terrible, and causes the user to do things they never would have dreamed before just to get their next fix. Dependency just means that you have a drug in your system (as prescribed), and cannot just stop taking it because that will induce withdrawal. Doctors help patients wean down in increments so that they don't experience as much discomfort.\n\nCandyDish, you don't sound like you are either of those. Simply someone in pain, struggling to cope and have a doctor 'believe' you since pain is invisible.\nI have been dealing with chronic pain for 7ish years now. The last 3 and a half years, I've been on slow release morphine and percocet for intractable pain. I'm a complicated case, unfortunately and the reality is that these narcotics allow me a higher quality of life. I'm able to actually move around and go out in small spurts.\nI'm 32, and have been through my fair share of doctors like the one you just experienced. Something I would suggest, see if there is a Patient Advocate you can go to, even better if they specialize in your condition. They will come with you to difficult appointments and can legally speak on your behalf to the doctor. They fight for your health, comfort and well-being when you are unable.\nAnother suggestion, when you find a good doctor that understands you and wants the best for you, hold on to them and never let go :) never forget that YOU are in charge of your health and you decide who will be your doctor. If the current one is not a match, tell them you don't feel your needs are being met and either ask for a referral to another or find yourself another in your plan. \nLast thing, its a slow process but pain centers are worth it. I would suggest a large one, preferably attached to a hospital so you can see multiple specialists. They are used to people being in pain, and are not there to judge you. Its what they do, unlike a primary care/internest.\nI'm a patient at Brigham and Womens Pain Center in Boston. They are so professional. My goal is to be pill free, so in January I'm starting Botox injections for nerve damage in my neck and migraines. Then in February I'm getting Lidocaine infusions to see if it relieves my bone/joint pains.
