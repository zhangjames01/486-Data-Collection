Perhaps your parents would be okay with his coming to visit you all there, so they can be sure he is not going to kidnap you? That is how my mother felt about it.\n\nI agree. The 12 hour drive isn't that bad, considering. In your opinion, would it be better to introduce it as; \"he's visiting family in the next town over and can he swing by for a day?\" *or* \"He's coming out here solely to meet me.

Thank you. It puts the ball on their court that I'm okay with him and I want them to be okay with him and that there's nothing I'm hiding and there's nothing he's hiding.

And it would make us wait even longer to see one another. It's already been two and a half years, and so they don't think I'm jumping into it, it'd have to be about that long again - and I don't think either of us want to wait that long for it to happen. \n\ntl;dr It really helped, thank you, thank you, thank you. You've made some great points about being open and letting them accept it; its really helped and there's a lot that you've said that's let me see from the angle of someone else who's been through it and other ways to come about it for the least amount of fear/misunderstanding on anyone's part.

Can you name at least two or three things? If not, you might need to consider that, despite the time you've known each other and your lengthy conversations, you still don't know all sides of him. This can be a challenge in starting a relationship long distance -- it can be hard to get to know all aspects of a person. But understanding -- and being able to accept -- someone's flaws is crucial to making a relationship work, I think.\n\nI totally agree. While there's things (albeit, few and far between) that I know I dislike about him, its nothing that I know I can't live with. For example; I was raised in a family that is against drinking for the most part-my mother extremely so. So me being not inclined to drink was just ingrained into me as a person. He drinks. He's of age. However, he's responsible about it, and he's not out there every week getting drunk off his face.\n\n&gt;This is a little concerning. Usually, siblings are understanding of each others' love interests. Have you had a chance to talk with your sister about her concerns? Do you think she's \"playing the parents' advocate,\" so to speak? Or is there something else there?\n\nNot her... She's very, very protective of her 'little sister'. If any passing guy so much as glances at me, she goes into protective mode and metaphorically beats down whomever it was.\nI've only gotten a bit of a chance to talk to her about it. Her main concerns are that \u201cI'm sure he's okay but you could probably do better. I mean, he doesn't even live here.\u201d Which is kind of bs because she hasn't even bothered to get to know him, she's always been stand off-ish towards him because she knew we liked each other. -Problem is though, she wasn't like that AT ALL before I told her that we had some interest in one another... I think it's a bit of both; parents' advocate and something else that I'm not too sure of \u2013 whether its overprotective or another thing. \n\n&gt; Where do you see this relationship going? Are you happy to keep it long distance indefinitely? Will you or he be willing to move at some point? (BTW, I imagine your parents might ask similar questions \u2026)\n\nNo, it wouldn't remain long distance. He'd be the one moving because he doesn't have great attachments to his family(he was raised by his mom after his dad ditched them when he was 3 \u2013 another complaint of my sister's.) He's totally fine with moving (we've actually brought up this topic) and he wants to switch universities anyway because his university is screwing him over and such(classes being discontinued 3 weeks to the end of the semester and after doing all the credits for it, not getting any credits because the teacher ditched the class.), so he's totally okay with the change of location. \n\n&gt;How much longer do you plan to live at home? You're 18; you're an adult. But if you're still living at home, that does change the dynamic and frankly puts the power in your parents' court (e.g., \"not under my roof,\" etc.)\n\nI honestly have no clue. At this point it may be 4 years or so, since I'm in college and living at home means I can save up for a place of my own and not go bankrupt right off the bat. \nExactly. That's the whole mentality of \u201cyou live in my house, you do it this way.\u201d \n\n&gt;PS: Given all the talking/Skyping you're doing, and that you live at home, is it possible your parents already know (or have an inkling at least)?\n\nPossibly...however I think they think that I'm just studying or playing video games every now and again, even though my door is shut and I'm in my room almost every single night talking to him...
