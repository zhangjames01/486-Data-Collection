There are pending lawsuits, yes, but Bank of America has been dealing with law suits regarding the mortgage crisis since it happened.  A drop in stock price has absolutely no impact on the actual business, however it will have an impact on the executives at the bank.  These folks are the ones who are appointed by the stock holders and ultimately will lose their jobs if they are no longer seen as effective.\n\nStraight from the 10-Q:\n&gt; Net income (loss) was $(8.8) billion and $(6.8) billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 compared to $3.1 billion and $6.3 billion for the same periods in 2010. The principal contributors to the net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were the following: $14.0 billion of representations and warranties provision in the second quarter largely related to the BNY Mellon Settlement as well as other mortgage-related costs, including a $2.6 billion non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, higher mortgage-related litigation expense and increased mortgage assessments and waivers costs.\n\nBasically, as Bank of America settles its lawsuits, net income will continue to be negative.  I don't have a huge amount of time to find the exact figure, but if you adjust the losses of 2Q2011 by the settlements, net income is positive.  This isn't saying the bank is doing great, these lawsuits have a definite impact on the financial strength of the company, but it shows the underlying health of the company outside of the mortgage issues.  \n\nAnother quick glance at the 10-Q (page 12) will show the non-interest income coming into the bank.  Total non-interest income was $1.990Bn, however if you adjust for the $13.196Bn in mortgage losses you see non-interest income of $15.186Bn.  This primarily comes from trading account profits, investment/brokerage services, services charges, and card income.  Again, the institution itself is healthy from a non-mortgage standpoint and is making a lot of money.  \n\nFinally, a look at the balance sheet.  Bank of America has total assets at June 30th, 2011 of roughly $2.3 trillion dollars.  Digging deeper, Tier 1 capital is $153.1Bn with a minimum required of $55.7Bn.  That is a great deal of breathing room if losses continue for the next few years.  Finally, digging even deeper, nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are sitting at $30.1Bn, which is a lot, but a decrease from the $35.6Bn 6 months prior.  \n\nTL:DR; Bank of America is not in trouble of collapsing.

There are pending lawsuits, yes, but Bank of America has been dealing with law suits regarding the mortgage crisis since it happened.  A drop in stock price has absolutely no impact on the actual business, however it will have an impact on the executives at the bank.  These folks are the ones who are appointed by the stock holders and ultimately will lose their jobs if they are no longer seen as effective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Straight from the 10-Q:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Net income (loss) was $(8.8) billion and $(6.8) billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 compared to $3.1 billion and $6.3 billion for the same periods in 2010. The principal contributors to the net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 were the following: $14.0 billion of representations and warranties provision in the second quarter largely related to the BNY Mellon Settlement as well as other mortgage-related costs, including a $2.6 billion non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge, higher mortgage-related litigation expense and increased mortgage assessments and waivers costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, as Bank of America settles its lawsuits, net income will continue to be negative.  I don&amp;#39;t have a huge amount of time to find the exact figure, but if you adjust the losses of 2Q2011 by the settlements, net income is positive.  This isn&amp;#39;t saying the bank is doing great, these lawsuits have a definite impact on the financial strength of the company, but it shows the underlying health of the company outside of the mortgage issues.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another quick glance at the 10-Q (page 12) will show the non-interest income coming into the bank.  Total non-interest income was $1.990Bn, however if you adjust for the $13.196Bn in mortgage losses you see non-interest income of $15.186Bn.  This primarily comes from trading account profits, investment/brokerage services, services charges, and card income.  Again, the institution itself is healthy from a non-mortgage standpoint and is making a lot of money.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, a look at the balance sheet.  Bank of America has total assets at June 30th, 2011 of roughly $2.3 trillion dollars.  Digging deeper, Tier 1 capital is $153.1Bn with a minimum required of $55.7Bn.  That is a great deal of breathing room if losses continue for the next few years.  Finally, digging even deeper, nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties are sitting at $30.1Bn, which is a lot, but a decrease from the $35.6Bn 6 months prior.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR; Bank of America is not in trouble of collapsing.
