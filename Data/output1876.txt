This is not an easy task, and I wouldn't get down on yourself if you can't convince an actively delusional patient not to take weird medications given to them by strangers while they're incarcerated.  Even attendings will struggle to get much buy-in for medications from delusional patients.\n\nThe defining feature of delusions isn't just that they're false, it's that they're *fixed*.  If you can successfully \"talk a patient out of it,\" it probably wasn't a delusion (perhaps a preoccupation, an overvalued idea, or an anxious cognition, but not a delusion).\n\nBut we often have to treat these patients.  Not always - sometimes (as often in delusional disorder) they do just fine in everyday life so long as its unrelated to their delusional content.  But in something like schizophrenia, they're often part of a bigger problem, and can contribute to reasons that jeopardize the safety of the patient (e.g., believes food is poisoned, so refuses to eat) or others (e.g., believes neighbor is plotting to kill them, so plans to kill them first).\n\nSo how do we approach these patients?  Here are some ideas that have worked at least modestly well for me:\n\n1. Be human.  Your patient is sick, even if they don't realize it.  They're also in a strange environment against their will.  The patient may not respond to a gentle, therapeutic approach, but I think it's more likely than if they're aggressively confronted about their nonsensical beliefs.\n2. Frame the delusional beliefs as a shared enemy for you and the patient to tackle collaboratively.  Your instinct to be empathic is excellent - delusions are often frightening and distressing, and acknowledging that can help build even a small element of trust.  E.g., \"I can imagine it would be distressing to feel like the government is watching you, and I'd like to see if we can help you feel less like that.\"\n3. Don't try to overexplain delusions as a biological process, but I think it's fine to try to orient the patient to the idea of \"the brain playing tricks on us.\"  This takes blame away from *the patient* and puts it on something outside their conscious control.  I think this helps talk about delusions in a way that doesn't come across as attacking the patient.\n4. Sometimes even though patients don't have insight into their psychotic symptoms, they do have a bit of insight into the problems they cause.  Try exploring areas where the patient's life may be deteriorating due to their symptoms, and see if they'll accept help for that.  For example, have they stopped eating or drinking?  Are they no longer socializing?  If they're employed, has their work suffered?\n5. With regard to medication, I will reassure my patients that while antipsychotics have side effects, we have many different options with different side effect profiles, and we'll work to find one the patient tolerates.  I envision paranoid patients viewing psychiatrists as heartless, uncaring pill-pushers, and I try to distance myself from that, even if we do ultimately use medications over objection.\n\nI'll edit this if I think of any more pearls, but the take-home points I would emphasize are (a) be human, (b) ally with the patient against the delusions, and (c) don't get down on yourself if the patient isn't receptive.  Gratification from psychiatric treatment doesn't always come fast, and our patients aren't always in the state of mind to express gratitude or appreciation, but these patients are suffering horribly, and it makes all the difference to have providers who give enough of a damn to even think to ask how best to approach and help them.", "edited": 1678344789.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "attending", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "MD"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psych attending here)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excellent question.

They&amp;#39;re also in a strange environment against their will.  The patient may not respond to a gentle, therapeutic approach, but I think it&amp;#39;s more likely than if they&amp;#39;re aggressively confronted about their nonsensical beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frame the delusional beliefs as a shared enemy for you and the patient to tackle collaboratively.  Your instinct to be empathic is excellent - delusions are often frightening and distressing, and acknowledging that can help build even a small element of trust.  E.g., &amp;quot;I can imagine it would be distressing to feel like the government is watching you, and I&amp;#39;d like to see if we can help you feel less like that.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t try to overexplain delusions as a biological process, but I think it&amp;#39;s fine to try to orient the patient to the idea of &amp;quot;the brain playing tricks on us.&amp;quot;  This takes blame away from &lt;em&gt;the patient&lt;/em&gt; and puts it on something outside their conscious control.  I think this helps talk about delusions in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t come across as attacking the patient.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sometimes even though patients don&amp;#39;t have insight into their psychotic symptoms, they do have a bit of insight into the problems they cause.  Try exploring areas where the patient&amp;#39;s life may be deteriorating due to their symptoms, and see if they&amp;#39;ll accept help for that.  For example, have they stopped eating or drinking?  Are they no longer socializing?  If they&amp;#39;re employed, has their work suffered?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;With regard to medication, I will reassure my patients that while antipsychotics have side effects, we have many different options with different side effect profiles, and we&amp;#39;ll work to find one the patient tolerates.  I envision paranoid patients viewing psychiatrists as heartless, uncaring pill-pushers, and I try to distance myself from that, even if we do ultimately use medications over objection.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll edit this if I think of any more pearls, but the take-home points I would emphasize are (a) be human, (b) ally with the patient against the delusions, and (c) don&amp;#39;t get down on yourself if the patient isn&amp;#39;t receptive.  Gratification from psychiatric treatment doesn&amp;#39;t always come fast, and our patients aren&amp;#39;t always in the state of mind to express gratitude or appreciation, but these patients are suffering horribly, and it makes all the difference to have providers who give enough of a damn to even think to ask how best to approach and help them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11mha4e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "light", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/medicalschool/comments/11mha4e/how_do_i_convince_an_actively_psychotic_patient/jbidtnz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11mha4e/how_do_i_convince_an_actively_psychotic_patient/", "name": "t1_jbidtnz", "author_flair_template_id": "83c621c8-10a2-11e5-b870-0e9d976001dd", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/medicalschool", "author_flair_text": "MD", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678344592.0, "created_utc": 1678344592.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#ff4500", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/11mha4e/how_do_i_convince_an_actively_psychotic_patient/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2re2p", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Referring to yourself as 'Student Doctor' instead of 'Medical Student': yes or no?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 7, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "medicalschool", "link_author": "an1m0s1ty", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbcy95j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "magzillas", "num_comments": 299, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbc5oey", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_5dv0l", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is my take, personally.
