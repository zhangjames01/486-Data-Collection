Im also a 5&amp;#39;2 blonde girl so no one ever took me seriously until I flipped my shit...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Im at this really expensive small preparatory academy with this crazy gym teacher who gives out king size candy bars. Well I wanted a candy bar on break one day and he said he wouldnt give me one. So I look over and see a very large puddle that was the result of heavy rains and poor soil distribution. I say &amp;quot;will you give me a candy bar if i jump in that puddle?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;what I didnt know is a) puddle was really deep B) there was an entire patch of jumping cholla &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindropuntia_fulgida\"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindropuntia_fulgida&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the puddle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; thinking i wouldnt jump. Me being the attention whore that I was totally jumped into the puddle and sunk very fast. With almost the entire school around the puddle laughing as I jumped in. When I got out and got my candy bar I was covered in mud , wet and very cold with cactus attached everywhere. This is when I noticed people where laughing at me and not with me. :( but the candy bar was good, and it shut that teacher up which was awesome since he was the one I liked the least &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;DR Jumped into a muddy puddle full of cactus for a candy bar....:( not the best highlight of my highschool life. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1kw6o5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1kw6o5/dear_reddit_what_are_awkward_times_when_you/cbt830c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1kw6o5/dear_reddit_what_are_awkward_times_when_you/", "name": "t1_cbt830c", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1377201314.0, "created_utc": 1377201314.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1kw6o5/dear_reddit_what_are_awkward_times_when_you/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What is the worst thing a teacher has ever said to you?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "maplewars", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cbt77y3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Nikoo", "num_comments": 1903, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1kuurw", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4svz2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "not to me but..\n\nWatched a philosophy teacher in sophomore year of collage pick out a very Catholic student (it was a small community collage class) asking him to stand up in front of the class and asked him some very innocent questions about being a Catholic such as \"are you Catholic? what are your fundamental beliefs? \"stuff like that.  \n\nThen as this kid who was pretty shy starts to answer the questions the teacher proceeds to interrupt him and basically rip his religion apart in front of the entire class reducing the kid almost to tears but he seemed so shocked he just sat down and was very quite.\n\nNow I dont believe in organized religion, nor do I really support any beliefs that are catholic but I dont at all think it is okay to publicly defile someones religion in front of their peers or really at all.

Many of my clients currently are some of the &amp;#39;wickedest&amp;#39; worst people you can imagine by society standards but it is my job to see them as human and damaged this is hard for normal people to grasp since they would rather just gas the pedophile then hear what he has to say about it or maybe the reason he is one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;DR Im a sex therapist ; I specialize in interracial sexual identity problems (sexual issues that arise from cultural differences) and neglect. I deal often with the worst of the worst of society&amp;#39;s dark underbelly and Im damn good at it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the squares I say Im a relationship therapist or Im just a therapist, I rarely every admit Im a sexual therapist IRL because people get the wrong impression almost always.  My mom just says Im a doctor like her but doesn&amp;#39;t tell people what kind and I haven&amp;#39;t started my doctorate program yet so Im not really sure why she does that haha maybe shame. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1kk1hd", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1kk1hd/what_are_some_of_the_perks_of_your_job_that/cbpv0ch/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1kk1hd/what_are_some_of_the_perks_of_your_job_that/", "name": "t1_cbpv0ch", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1376775021.0, "created_utc": 1376775021.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1kk1hd/what_are_some_of_the_perks_of_your_job_that/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What is a true feeling or belief that you hold, that would really offend most people?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "Pantzzzzless", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cbpupsa", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Nikoo", "num_comments": 11774, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cbpo6hk", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4svz2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "ah this one hits me right in the feels, I have a lot of obese friends that use it as an excuse..My boyfriend was anorexic when I met him and it took us 4 years to help get to a healthy weight.
