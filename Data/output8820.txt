CO2 is great because as I said before, it gets them stuck, and when they're stuck they're not sucking your blood, which means they're not laying eggs, which means no new generation.  It's also great because it tells you if what you're doing is working.

I don't envy you, but I truly do wish you well and even if your LL doesn't heat treat, you *can* get them under control pretty well on your own with just the CO2 and the Cirkil.  We were done with them in about...three months?  That was the point we were sure they were gone.  It was a shitty three months.\n\nThe thing that sucks is that in an apartment building, while you may be on top of the situation, the other people may not be.  So it sort of falls to you to be the responsible party.  I consider myself lucky that I was in a single family home.  Dealing with them in an apartment building, where I would have had zero control over what my neighbors were doing would have been rough. \n\nP.S.  Don't forget to treat your car.  It's one of the more effective ways to reinfest yourself after you thought you had them pushing up daisies.  Best of luck.\n\nP.P.S.  Cirkil will ~not~ hurt your dog.  This was one of my major fears with other methods.  Cirkil is a super concentrated form of neem oil, to my understanding.
