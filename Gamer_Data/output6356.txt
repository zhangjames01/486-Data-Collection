I also hope that you don&amp;#39;t have a tree pollen allergy because the sidewalks are just yellow ~this time of year because there&amp;#39;s so much of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UGA is definitely a top tier campus aesthetically (North campus is absolutely gorgeous albeit South Campus where I spend most of my time is more utilitarian) and the microbrew+coffee scene is shockingly good for the cities size, but the food is mediocre to bad (some exceptions, but if you pick a random local restaurant it&amp;#39;s going to be bad), the shopping is terrible, and there&amp;#39;s very little to do if you&amp;#39;re not interested in day drinking. The best part of Athens is that you&amp;#39;re close to the North Georgia mountains which are gorgeous and the climate is great, but otherwise it&amp;#39;s just a medium-small city with a bunch of medium-small city stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I guess while I had bars in mind when I said I hope you like drinking, 5 points bottle shop is a pretty damn impressive liquor store. It has nothing on the true giants in that field, but it&amp;#39;s still damn good if you&amp;#39;re at all interested in more exotic liquors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11wibn7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CFB/comments/11wibn7/which_college_football_town_would_you_want_to/jd0anex/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/11wibn7/which_college_football_town_would_you_want_to/", "name": "t1_jd0anex", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CFB", "author_flair_text": ":lsu2: :georgia: LSU \u2022 Georgia", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679350497.0, "created_utc": 1679350497.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/11wibn7/which_college_football_town_would_you_want_to/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm9d", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Which College Football Town would you want to live in year round?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "CFB", "link_author": "Aggravating-Mind-657", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jd04kes", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Mezmorizor", "num_comments": 1340, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcyiv7b", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8drz0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "...it's Chicago.
