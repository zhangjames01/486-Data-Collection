I know Alawites, defectors from the army who joined the FSA and people who now fight in jihadist brigades, including, I've heard, Daesh.\n\nOne of my friends was killed in government detention. He was from the rugby team I played in, and was detained at the start of the revolution, when he was coming back from watching a tournament. He was travelling with some others, and I believe they took him straight to the site at the Airport Hotel. 2 months later his body came back.\n\nIf you didn't go there before the revolution and get to know the people, you have no right to assume what they do and don't want. It's an incredibly complex country, but the basic schism is West - East. The desert forms a barrier of language, religion and education. Deir ez-Zour borders Iraq, and many people there were radicalised by the invasion in 2003. Funding from the Assad government has historically been lower, because it is mostly Sunni and the people speak Iraqi dialect, not Shami.\n\nIn the West (of the country) there was significant funding for Baathist state schools, which provided fairly decent education and a strong secular message. People along this side tend to be far more liberal, more westernised and more educated.\n\nIt was these people that started the revolution, not those in the East. Again, unless you've been there, you wouldn't realise the frustration many people had with the repressive policies there. Because of its stance toward Israel, there was a trade embargo that meant virtually every car was a Lada or a 1950s cadillac. There were no western clothes shops, so everyone wore fake armani tshirts and black jeans that looked ridiculous. And they knew they looked ridiculous. There was just no way to get anything better. Facebook and Youtube were nominally blocked. And fundamentally, I think that was why there was a revolution. People across the Arab World were fed up with being dominated by these immensely rich dictators who tried to subdue their people. \n\nAnd the Mukhabarat are fucking scary. Not because of who they are, but what they can do. Even as a foreigner, they could just come pick you up and hold you for as long as they liked. One of my friends, another westerner, had a girlfriend who lived about five minutes away. One night he was walking to hers and the Mukhabarat picked him up, took him to one of their sites. They thought he was trying to avoid paying rental taxes, and they showed him a complete list of his movements from the day he got there. He had to explain them all before they let him go, a process that took around 6-7 hours. In one of my shared houses, a secret policeman who was about 50 used to pull up a chair and just listen, without saying anything, to our conversations. It wasn't subtle, it was just meant to intimidate.\n\nTLDR: The idea that the Syrian revolution began as an Islamist uprising is, frankly, the conclusion of someone who never experienced the country before it changed. \n\n\n\nLinks:\n\nHere's the first 'day of rage' that failed\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/world/middleeast/05syria.html?_r=0\n\nThen catalysed by the killing of hundreds of protesters (NSFW obviously)\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13234557\nhttp://www.digitaljournal.com/article/329590\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb5YIg-vyOE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-PAVKmg-lk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PcihhZxLNI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni9Y3-hV-RE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvjPN4MMqVo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLI_z0OXxcc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wlg2fPrXgo&amp;bpctr=1431332513\n\nBarrel Bombs:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79orEOQ_mZ4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMELwAXoZV0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApZdvz_n4ro\n\nChlorine:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb5tNK5Pzx4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLDZRUSnXA\n\nCaesar's photos\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/10-000-bodies-inside-syrian-president-bashar-al-assads-crackdown-1406315472\nhttp://acloserlookonsyria.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Talk:Torture_Photos_from_%22Caesar%22#Photo_Catalog\n\nSednaya:\nhttps://wikileaks.org/cable/2010/02/10DAMASCUS158.html\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/international/world/former-prisoners-fight-in-syrian-insurgency-a-927158.html\n\nOpposition declaration of secularity:\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/international/world/syrian-opposition-presents-blueprint-for-shift-to-democracy-a-852602.html\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a journalist now and I lived in Syria 2009-10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of friends and acquaintances there, on all sides.

It&amp;#39;s an incredibly complex country, but the basic schism is West - East. The desert forms a barrier of language, religion and education. Deir ez-Zour borders Iraq, and many people there were radicalised by the invasion in 2003. Funding from the Assad government has historically been lower, because it is mostly Sunni and the people speak Iraqi dialect, not Shami.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the West (of the country) there was significant funding for Baathist state schools, which provided fairly decent education and a strong secular message. People along this side tend to be far more liberal, more westernised and more educated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was these people that started the revolution, not those in the East. Again, unless you&amp;#39;ve been there, you wouldn&amp;#39;t realise the frustration many people had with the repressive policies there. Because of its stance toward Israel, there was a trade embargo that meant virtually every car was a Lada or a 1950s cadillac. There were no western clothes shops, so everyone wore fake armani tshirts and black jeans that looked ridiculous. And they knew they looked ridiculous. There was just no way to get anything better. Facebook and Youtube were nominally blocked. And fundamentally, I think that was why there was a revolution. People across the Arab World were fed up with being dominated by these immensely rich dictators who tried to subdue their people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the Mukhabarat are fucking scary. Not because of who they are, but what they can do. Even as a foreigner, they could just come pick you up and hold you for as long as they liked. One of my friends, another westerner, had a girlfriend who lived about five minutes away. One night he was walking to hers and the Mukhabarat picked him up, took him to one of their sites. They thought he was trying to avoid paying rental taxes, and they showed him a complete list of his movements from the day he got there. He had to explain them all before they let him go, a process that took around 6-7 hours. In one of my shared houses, a secret policeman who was about 50 used to pull up a chair and just listen, without saying anything, to our conversations. It wasn&amp;#39;t subtle, it was just meant to intimidate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: The idea that the Syrian revolution began as an Islamist uprising is, frankly, the conclusion of someone who never experienced the country before it changed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Links:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the first &amp;#39;day of rage&amp;#39; that failed\n&lt;a

Had a no fly zone been implemented within a year, there would be no jihadist group in Syria (Al-Nusra, the first, announced itself in January 2012, almost a year after the start of the civil war). The reason they have been able to grow, as you (kind of) point out, is the superior funding and influence of jihadist groups, particularly the easy availability of weapons and ammo. This growing influence could have been stubbed out early on, before it had any root in the ground and before tensions between the ethnic groups worsened into sectarian violence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the worst that could have come out of forcing Assad to resign in 2011? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Could the alternative really be worse than the civil war? Would 1 in 2 Syrians need aid to survive? Would 8.6 million IDPs and refugees have left their homes? Would the Syrian economy have lost \u00a350 bn? Would there be Jihadists running part of the country? Sectarian hatred and massacre?
