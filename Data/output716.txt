The whole point of using a logical argument (deductive reasoning) is typically that you don\u2019t have evidence to prove your claim, so you have to resort to logic. \n\nNo, this is a misunderstanding. Deductive reasoning is nothing unique to arguments for God or even to philosophy, and it's extremely common in all disciplines or types of rational inquiry. Like, say you're unsure whether bats have livers, so you ask a biologist. They say \"bats definitely have livers, because they're mammals and all mammals have livers.\" That's deductive reasoning. We can write it out as a syllogism if we want to:\n\n1. All bats are mammals.\n2. All mammals have livers.\n3. Therefore, all bats have livers.\n\nNotice this argument is simply a way of offering evidence for an idea by showing how it follows from other ideas; it's not an *alternative* to evidence.\n\n&gt;The issue is, there\u2019s often no way to prove or disprove your premises and conclusions. You can often create a valid argument, but there\u2019s no way to know if the premises are true. Simply stating a premise doesn\u2019t make it true. Here\u2019s a basic one I see fairly often, P1: All things had a beginning. P2: Something cannot come from nothing. C: God created everything. \n\nFirst of all, your example isn't a valid argument, so perhaps the issue is that you're not familiar with this technical term. [Here's an overview of validity and soundness.](https://iep.utm.edu/val-snd/)\n\nSecond, a premise is not something that's meant to be assumed without evidence, it's something we must judge to be true or false when we evaluate an argument. Sometimes they're things we can already judge from experience or do some simple research to confirm or deny, as in the bat example above. Other times it's far more difficult, as tends to be the case in philosophy, but nothing fundamentally different is going on there. \n\nSo if someone offers you a premise like \"all things had a beginning\" in an actually valid argument, and you doubt it's true, the thing to say is \"I doubt that this premise is true, why do you think it should be believed?\" That's totally reasonable. Saying \"oh, this is a logical argument, therefore it doesn't establish anything\" doesn't make any sense at all, as I hope I've explained.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s is some truth to that idea though. The whole point of using a logical argument (deductive reasoning) is typically that you don\u2019t have evidence to prove your claim, so you have to resort to logic. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, this is a misunderstanding. Deductive reasoning is nothing unique to arguments for God or even to philosophy, and it&amp;#39;s extremely common in all disciplines or types of rational inquiry. Like, say you&amp;#39;re unsure whether bats have livers, so you ask a biologist. They say &amp;quot;bats definitely have livers, because they&amp;#39;re mammals and all mammals have livers.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s deductive reasoning. We can write it out as a syllogism if we want to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All bats are mammals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All mammals have livers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Therefore, all bats have livers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice this argument is simply a way of offering evidence for an idea by showing how it follows from other ideas; it&amp;#39;s not an &lt;em&gt;alternative&lt;/em&gt; to evidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The issue is, there\u2019s often no way to prove or disprove your premises and conclusions. You can often create a valid argument, but there\u2019s no way to know if the premises are true. Simply stating a premise doesn\u2019t make it true. Here\u2019s a basic one I see fairly often, P1: All things had a beginning. P2: Something cannot come from nothing. C: God created everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, your example isn&amp;#39;t a valid argument, so perhaps the issue is that you&amp;#39;re not familiar with this technical term. &lt;a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/val-snd/\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an overview of validity and soundness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, a premise is not something that&amp;#39;s meant to be assumed without evidence, it&amp;#39;s something we must judge to be true or false when we evaluate an argument. Sometimes they&amp;#39;re things we can already judge from experience or do some simple research to confirm or deny, as in the bat example above. Other times it&amp;#39;s far more difficult, as tends to be the case in philosophy, but nothing fundamentally different is going on there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if someone offers you a premise like &amp;quot;all things had a beginning&amp;quot; in an actually valid argument, and you doubt it&amp;#39;s true, the thing to say is &amp;quot;I doubt that this premise is true, why do you think it should be believed?&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s totally reasonable.
