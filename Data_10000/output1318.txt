If you feel better or see more results when you use powders and supplements and your diet is satisfying to you, that's more sustainable in terms of eating well, training well, and general happiness. If you get all you need from whole foods and it works for you, that's rad! I think it's just about creating a way of eating that is energizing, satisfying, and therefore long-term. For some people, powders and supplements make that more doable for a range of reasons. \n\nFor me, I will sometimes use protein powder to make a shake because my shakes are delicious, are a treat for me, and I *feel* (emotionally) pleased and satisfied by knowing the macros are on point. It's a mix of physical and emotional satisfaction. I also take a sleep-aid supplement that helps with digestion. I can tell the difference with that one! Ha. \n\nAlthough it sounds like you're super active, I think that a lot of people who are doing heavy lifting and looking to build lots of muscle feel better and believe their progress is better when they eat a really high-protein diet, so their experience of getting those nutrients on a whole-foods diet only might be different than yours given your activities.

They also have pretty good protein macros for how good they are, ha!). I also will sometimes carry nuts, or if I have access to a fridge, hummus with veggies. Try out a few things that you can really carry with you easily, and see how it goes. If you're eating a lot of veggies and fruits that don't stick with you, it's just a reality that you are going to need to eat more often to not be miserable.\n\nOthers have already said this, but if the meal replacement shakes aren't working for you, try something else! I make my own protein shakes in a Ninja with a big scoop of protein powder, some frozen fruit, coconut water, and a little bit of yogurt. They are delicious and keep me full for a really long time compared to store-bought meal replacement shakes.\n\nOne thing I've been thinking about recently is how to be mindful and make good choices WHILE I'm super hungry. This doesn't happen to me much anymore because my snack game is honed to a sharp edge, but I find a momentary pause to think to myself, \"Oh, I'm really hungry and it's making me feel panicky\" helps me to distance myself a little bit from the feeling of hunger. The reality is that being hungry for a few minutes is not going to kill me, and if I can just notice that it's driving my behavior towards something I don't want to do, I have more power to make a real choice instead of impulsively eating junk. \n\nThis mindfulness approach has also helped me with a fact that others have mentioned: cutting to lose weight is tough. You will be hungry sometimes. Learning not to let that make you too miserable is a skill that can really serve you in the long term. I know mindfulness can come off as really hokey, but I have found it so helpful to make a little distance between the hunger and my response. I get to say, \"oh hey, I'm hungry. What does that mean for me given what's going on right now?\" instead of being like \"MOAR CHEETOS NOWWWW\" without even thinking about it. Just my two cents.

I always keep a protein bar with me for emergency situations (I like Power Crunch, but I also like the fiber bars from Trader Joe&amp;#39;s - they taste great and because they have a lot of fiber, they stick with me really well. They also have pretty good protein macros for how good they are, ha!). I also will sometimes carry nuts, or if I have access to a fridge, hummus with veggies. Try out a few things that you can really carry with you easily, and see how it goes. If you&amp;#39;re eating a lot of veggies and fruits that don&amp;#39;t stick with you, it&amp;#39;s just a reality that you are going to need to eat more often to not be miserable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others have already said this, but if the meal replacement shakes aren&amp;#39;t working for you, try something else!
