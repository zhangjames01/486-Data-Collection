Now, this is where the importance of index funds / beta vs. actively managed funds come into play.\n\nAs prior mentioned, an index fund is a fund which tries to match itself to a certain index. For example, the S&amp;P 500 index fund tries to match itself to the S&amp;P 500 index. It tries not to under perform or over perform the S&amp;P 500 but rather perform exactly how the index performs with a beta of 1. Quick definition, beta is simply a word to which means volatility. With a beta of 1, if the S&amp;P 500 index goes up 10%, the index fund should also go up 10%. If the fund has a beta of 2, if the index goes up 10%, the fund will go up 20%. With a beta of .5, if the index goes up 10%, the fund will go up 5%. So on and so forth. With that goal of a 1 beta, fund managers of index funds will buy and sell to try and match the index. If an index fund has a beta of anything other than 1, it means the fund manager is not buying or selling correctly.\n\nActively managed non indexed funds don't really have to match any kind of index. So for example, you could have two energy ETFs with a broad objective of making money off of companies in the energy sector. One may be 100% oil and have companies such as Exxon, Chevron, RDS, refineries, etc. within it. While another may be 50% oil and 30% solar and 20% natural gas. Technically, they are  both energy funds. They are not indexed so they dont have to worry about matching their performance to anything. The fund manager for the second company can, at their whim, decide to go 70% oil, 30% solar, and cut out natural gas. They would probably have to update their prospectus with such a drastic change but it would be within their power to do that. \n\n&gt; So if you think thaat the DOW/SNP 500 will do amazing and have a high return rate, you would buy an ETF that sell these indexes, correct? (Are they usually cheaper? why is that)\n\nIn regards to your earlier question, yes - if you think the DOW / S&amp;P 500 will have a high return rate and you don't have anything else you'd rather put your money in, then go ahead and buy into those index funds. Indexed funds, compared to actively managed funds, do typically have lower expense ratios. The reasoning being that the fund manager is really just a walking talking calculator. Their primary objective is to, again, keep the fund at a beta of 1 and imitate the S&amp;P 500 or whatever they're indexed to. Meanwhile, the person running an actively managed non indexed energy / healthcare / growth / dividend / international / whatever fund doesn't have anything to copy and index to.
