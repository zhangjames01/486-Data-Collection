Also, you'll want different copies of the key exotic weapons for different roles, and you'll need weapons to actually use in these builds, so some of your space will be devoted to that -- but even if you keep four each of the House, Showstopper, Big Al, LWM4s, and M700 Carbons, that's only 20 more slots against that 150.\n\nNow, there are also gear and weapon mods, but those should be uniquely matched with a specific item. That is, place a unique set of weapon mods onto a unique weapon *and leave them there*. Same for gear mods (including performance mods). If you PvP, you will likely want at least two (and maybe more!) versions of e.g. Striker, so you'll want to collect as many pieces as needed, recalibrate them for their role (PvP, PvE, and then mainststs as desired; builds like Nomad or Final Measure can be rolled in several ways), and then purchase or craft the gear mods (only purchase performance mods unless you enjoy frustration) specifically for those pieces and those roles.\n\nSlotted mods do not count against your inventory.\n\nFor the rest of it, you probably have heaps of utter trash.

Also, you&amp;#39;ll want different copies of the key exotic weapons for different roles, and you&amp;#39;ll need weapons to actually use in these builds, so some of your space will be devoted to that -- but even if you keep four each of the House, Showstopper, Big Al, LWM4s, and M700 Carbons, that&amp;#39;s only 20 more slots against that 150.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, there are also gear and weapon mods, but those should be uniquely matched with a specific item. That is, place a unique set of weapon mods onto a unique weapon &lt;em&gt;and leave them there&lt;/em&gt;. Same for gear mods (including performance mods). If you PvP, you will likely want at least two (and maybe more!) versions of e.g. Striker, so you&amp;#39;ll want to collect as many pieces as needed, recalibrate them for their role (PvP, PvE, and then mainststs as desired; builds like Nomad or Final Measure can be rolled in several ways), and then purchase or craft the gear mods (only purchase performance mods unless you enjoy frustration) specifically for those pieces and those roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slotted mods do not count against your inventory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the rest of it, you probably have heaps of utter trash. &lt;a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=Nt95teOYo_0\"&gt;Sort&lt;/a&gt;\n that &lt;a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=NFHXCrNqIGA\"&gt;out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are still collecting classified (or exotic) items, the best methods are &lt;a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1062ttv/division_1_classified_farming/j3erj4d/\"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; (and that link has a bonus link to some excellent starter and end-game builds).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11se4tp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/thedivision/comments/11se4tp/questions_about_div_1_exotic_weapons_and/jcgjhxv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/11se4tp/questions_about_div_1_exotic_weapons_and/", "name": "t1_jcgjhxv", "author_flair_template_id": "8765affe-e286-11e5-96a5-0e9d5a4e3d51", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/thedivision", "author_flair_text": "Survival", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678989000.0, "created_utc": 1678989000.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#ffffff", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/11se4tp/questions_about_div_1_exotic_weapons_and/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_53le6o", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Is it impossible to get the chemist weapon solo?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DMZ", "link_author": "SeanDOdoubleG", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcemxox", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "cabbagery", "num_comments": 18, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11shlor", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6g69u", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I assume you mean the M13B.
