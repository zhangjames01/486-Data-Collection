Similarly, galanatamine, a drug in a similar class, was named after the plant it came from: the Galanthus Caucasicus. Paclitaxel (Taxol) was named for the pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia. To venture into antibiotics, penicillin is named after the Penicillum fungi and streptomycin comes from Streptomyces bacteria.\n\nSome are named after their chemical structures. For instance, benzodiazepines are named after the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring. Examples of substructures include chlordiazepoxide (Librium), but diazepam (Valium) was the big seller. Then you have follow-on drugs that are just named similarly to the known drugs in the class, like alprazolam, bromazepam or lorazepam. Similar are the antipsychotics, like chlorpromazine, which have a phenothiazine core. Some, like chlormethiazole give you basically the entire chemical structure in their name.\n\nOf course, there's still some real odd ducks out there, where the derivation of the chemical name isn't straightforward.

Similarly, galanatamine, a drug in a similar class, was named after the plant it came from: the Galanthus Caucasicus. Paclitaxel (Taxol) was named for the pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia.

Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5-HTP and tryptophan before their widespread use can be recommended. The possible association between these substances and the potentially fatal Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome has not been elucidated. Because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, a similar topic was covered in a recent &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1o85jg/how_do_antidepressants_ssris_and_snris_treat/\"&gt;Mod&amp;#39;s Choice thread about SSRIs in anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it is worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: As a moderator, I have to remind users that all posts discussing personal experience with SSRIs will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1om0lj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/1om0lj/why_are_ssris_used_over_supplemental_serotonin/cctc34i/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1om0lj/why_are_ssris_used_over_supplemental_serotonin/", "name": "t1_cctc34i", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "author_flair_text": "Neuroscience | Neurology | Alzheimer's Drug Discovery", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1381978391.0, "created_utc": 1381978391.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1om0lj/why_are_ssris_used_over_supplemental_serotonin/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "With regular \"check-ups\" and under perfect conditions, could a tree live forever?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 48, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "askscience", "link_author": "Pink401k", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ccnqspg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "ren5311", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1nzw6c", "score": 48, "author_fullname": "t2_55dt0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Your question is a theoretical one, so let's start with some data.\n\n[Here is a list](http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm) of the maximum recorded ages for different tree species.  Bristlecone pines are the record holders, and sequoias also do quite well. Sequoias are probably ok with being second place because they are the largest living thing on earth (and \"sequoia\" is also the shortest word in the English language that contains all the vowels).\n\nYou'll find some species with shorter lifespans on there as well.  What are some reasons for shorter lifespans?  Well, the [Bradford pear tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callery_Pear) doesn't live as long as similar cultivars because the branching pattern makes it very susceptible to storm damage, so environmental hardiness is key. However, accidents still happen and we recently lost [The Senator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senator_\\(tree\\)) to fire, a cypress tree that clocked in at 3500 years.  Yet you stipulate perfect conditions, so what we're really interested in is [senescence](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/senescence).\n\nSo, let's go back and look at the real record holders.  Again, in terms of age, bristlecone pines are the oldest non-clonal trees, and the [Methuselah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_\\(tree\\)) held the record at just under 5000 years of age until very recently, when an older bristlecone was found nearby that dated to 5062 years of age.\n\nSo, the oldest known organism on the planet is a bristlecone pine.  Does it senesce?  Thus far, we do not have evidence that it does.  Researchers have shown that [aged specimens do not show impairments in important biological activities and do not seem to be accumulating mutations that would impair these activities](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11295507).  Interestingly, [other researchers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16034678) have shown an increase in [telomere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere) length and [telomerase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase) activity in bristlecone pines, which may help explain the relative immunity to senescence.\n\nHowever, [clonal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetative_cloning) tree systems can grow even older, with an 80,000 year old Quaking Aspen system called [Pando](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_\\(tree\\)) holding the record for oldest and heaviest (6,000,000 kg) \"organism.\"  (As an aside, \n[King Clone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Clone) is also kind of awesome, having been precisely dated to 11,700 years with both dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating.)\n\nTherefore, the real record for success is the approach used by these clonal trees, which also appear largely immune to senescence.  Recently however, [researchers have found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20808953) that eventually these extremely aged clonal tree systems start accumulating mutations that lead to reduced fertility.  So, it seems these incredibly old systems are not truly immortal after all.\n\nWell, at least we can still hope the bristlecone outlives it.
