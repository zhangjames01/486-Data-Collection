I hope this helps someone going tomorrow or looking forward to next year!\n\n**Arrival Time**: I arrived at noon and walked right in, no line. I am ~~lazy as f$%*~~ not a morning person, so I knew arriving at 6:00am to wait in line for three hours was not for me. I also was only coming from my apartment in Brooklyn and did not have any vendors I absolutely had to see, so that was also a huge part of my decision.\n\n**Shopping Experience**: I was able to visit, browse and purchase from 11 vendors. I was able to visit and browse an additional handful but didn't end up purchasing because they were either sold out (no more Anastasia Brow Wiz in Dark Brown), or I found better pricing (e.g., 1 full-size beautyblender with cleanser was $25 at Frends Beauty; 3 full-size beautyblenders plus 1 mini plus solid cleanser was $35 at Alcone). I had gone to all the vendors I wanted and made all my purchases was by 3:30 pm. Yes, it was crowded, but it didn't feel packed. Lines were orderly and everyone (attendees, staffers and company reps) was super friendly. If there's not a vendor there that you *have* to see, I highly recommend arriving later in the day (after 11:00am) as that still gives plenty of time for waiting in hour-plus lines at vendors without having to wait forever in the morning. \n\n**Lines**: It varied. The Morphe, Sigma, Sugarpill and LimeCrime booths had the longest lines that I could see. The longest I waited was 45 minutes for tarte (I was the weirdo reading my Kindle and eating a muffin in line to kill time). I waited about 20 minutes for Anastasia and maybe 10 minutes for LASplash. All other booths I went to had zero wait time. By the time I left around 3:30pm, the lines had gotten shorter, and I felt like by staying even later, there would be no issues with waiting in line except at the crazy booths mentioned above.\n\n**Prices**: I found next to zero info about pricing when I was researching IMATS, so here's what I remember from today:\n\n* *Tarte*: 40% to more than 50% off (ex: single blushes marked down to $10 from $26, Rainforest After Dark palette marked down to $20 from $38; price list in album)  \n* *Stila*: 40% off  \n* *MUFE*: 20% for non-pros, 40% for pros (this was also the only booth I went to that charged sales tax)  \n* *Lit Cosmetics*: 3 for $25 glitters; kits ranging from $15-$50 (price list in album)  \n* *Anastasia*: varied from 30%-ish to no discount (price list in album)  \n* *Ardell/China Glaze*: 8 for $20 lashes; $3 ea. for polishes  \n* *Hakuhodo*: no discount, but no sales tax  \n* *LASplash*: no discount, but free lip remover if you purchased 6 lip items ($12 ea.)\n* *Bdellium Tools*: 40% off\n* *Frends Beauty/Stilazzi*: $2 ea. shadows and blushes\n* *Beautylish*: selling Bioderma for same prices on their website\n* *NYX*: varied, but a lot around 30% off\n* *Morphe*: not positive, but from the prices I remember ($19.99 9-pan blush palette marked down to $15), I guess around 25%\n\n**Planning and Budgeting**: I spent an absurd amount of time researching vendors, products/swatches and prices prior to the event. I made an Excel sheet of the vendors I wanted to visit, their booth number, and the items I wanted to purchase with their retail prices as posted online (I wanted to make sure I wasn't buying an item that was discounted from a marked-up price). This. Helped. So. Much. Not only did it keep me on track with my budget, but at busy booths, I was able to just hand the sheet to a staffer and get my products without any hassle. I did leave wiggle room in my budget for impulse buys, but knowing what I wanted just streamlined the whole experience so that I wasn't overwhelmed by all of the options. Also: I brought all cash.
