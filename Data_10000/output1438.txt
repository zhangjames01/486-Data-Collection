I may start to imagine myself dead, but thats more of an uncomfortably depressed state for me rather than something I&amp;#39;m concerned I&amp;#39;ll do. I&amp;#39;ve already had the worst depression of my life several years ago, and I lasted feeling suicidal for every day of an entire year because of a very, very shitty living situation, but every day now is better than that, even the ones when I&amp;#39;m suicidally bored. &lt;strong&gt;Tl;dr: Please focus more on the &amp;quot;Boredom feels like &lt;em&gt;torture&lt;/em&gt; than the one word &amp;quot;suicide&amp;quot; in this instance. I do take it serious and hence why I included it, but it is not what is the problem here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1eazu1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/1eazu1/boredom_feels_like_torture_and_leads_to_suicidal/c9ykyrp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1eazu1/boredom_feels_like_torture_and_leads_to_suicidal/", "name": "t1_c9ykyrp", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1368544680.0, "created_utc": 1368544680.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1eazu1/boredom_feels_like_torture_and_leads_to_suicidal/"}}], "before": null}}
