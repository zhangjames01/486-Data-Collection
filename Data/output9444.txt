Zoom to the woods at the foot of the mountain, where in a clearing Rowena is brewing a potion. Her brow is furrowed as she slowly stirs the small cauldron, the liquid within turns a light gold-brown. She sighs, evidently unpleased, and bottles the potion in a flask before disappearing into the woods. Godric enters the clearing, sweaty and out of breath. He sees the flask, sniffs at the liquid inside and shrugs, drinking it all.] \n\n&gt;Later: [Rowena rushes in to the Founder's camp, anxiously calling for the others; Helga and Salazar are surprised by this show of anxiety from the normally unflappable witch.]  \nRowena: \"Do either of you know what happened to my potion?\"  \nHelga: \"What potion? What's wrong?\"  \nRowena: \"I was brewing an experimental potion and left to gather some more ingredients--when I returned, the flask with the potion in it was empty!\"  \nHelga: \"I've no idea, sorry Rowena.\"   \nSalazar: \"I know nothing of your potion either.\"  \nRowena: \"Where's Godric, then? Perhaps he knows, I doubt the flask could have emptied itself!\"  \nSalazar: \"You haven't seen him? He went looking for you some time ago...\" [Salazar pauses as the same thought occurs to all three Founders. Rowena pales.]\nHelga: \"You don't think he...?\"  \nSalazar: \"Decided to drink an unknown liquid because it, oh, looked nice? Knowing Godric, that's exactly what he did.\"  \nRowena: [groans] \"By the gods, that fool. I have no idea what that potion might do, it was completely untested. I don't believe it should be poisonous, but all the same, I better try to brew some kind of antitode or healing potion. Where could Godric have gone? We must find him as quickly possible!\"  \n[Helga and Salazar trade long suffering looks.]   \nHelga: \"We're going to have to rescue him, AGAIN, aren't we?\"  \n\n&gt;Later: [Salazar and Helga hike higher up the mountain, following a little ball of spell light that guides them higher and higher. The trees thin and give way to rocks. Salazar looks increasingly irritated.]   \nSalazar: [muttering] \"The tracking spell is leading straight toward's the dragon's lair. He cannot possibly be this idiotic. Even he knows to stay away from a dragon.\"  \nHelga: \"Well, who knows what the potion has done to him...we'll have to find him regardless. I do hope we don't have to face a dragon though. I did not exactly dress today in dragon fighting clothes.\"   \n[Helga smiles, and nudges Salazar, who seems to relax a little. At that moment they spot a glint of red; it is Godric in full armor kneeling behind some large boulders, waving excitedly at them. Helga and Salazar break into a brisk walk towards him, then grip their wands more tightly: a few hundred feet beyond Godric, they can now see a large dragon, sleeping in the afternoon sun.]  \nSalazar: \"Godric, what. are. you. doing?!\"  \nGodric: [slurring] \"Helloooo friends, I'm so...\" [hiccup] \"...so happy you could join me, I have a great idea. Saaaa...laaaa...Salaaaaa...zzzz..ar...Salzr..zar...Sal! Sal, I'm going to train the dragon!\" [Godric tries to suddenly stand up and brandish his sword, the other two hastily pull him back down behind the rocks.] \"He shall be my steed, and I will ride him into battle! Sal, you'll help me train the dragon, right?\"  [Salazar covers his eyes in disbelief.]  \nHelga: [Casting diagnostic spells over Godric.] \"Well, the good thing is that we can tell Rowena the potion isn't deathly poisonous anyway. All it seems to do is make a person spectacularly drunk, which I imagine isn't what she was trying for. He should be fine with some sleep and water. Godric, don't you want to come back to the camp with us?\"  \nGodric: \"No! I want to ride the dragon!\" [Godric springs out of reach and begins running towards the dragon.] \"Awake, my fire-breathing steed!\"   \nHelga and Salazar: [Chasing after Godric, shouting.] \"NO, GODRIC, DON'T WAKE THE DRAGON!\"\n\n&gt;Later: [Long chase scene with much cursing and near misses.]   \nMuch Later: [The four are patching themselves up in a totally new location, sporting scrapes and burnt clothes and in Godric's case, some singed hair. Godric is now sober and feeling rather sheepish.]  \nGodric: \"So...I want to apologize for...you know...causing a dragon to try to roast us, and all that. I was not exactly thinking clearly. On the other hand, it will make for a great first lesson, when we have the chance to build our school!\"   \nSalazar: \"*If* we actually stay alive long enough to found this school, this should be the damn motto.\"  \nRowena: \"Never wake a sleeping dragon?\"   \nHelga: [Breaking into laughter.] \"Rowena, you should have seen it! Godric tried to *tickle* the dragon. He even made baby noises.\"  \nSalazar: \"Of course, then the dragon woke up extra angry and almost burnt him to a crisp with its first breath.\"  \nRowena: \"Right, then...Never tickle a sleeping dragon!\"\n \n**Bonus:** [Promo poster for THE FOUNDERS](http://i.imgur.com/u9WiOo6.jpg), featuring Godric, Helga, Rowena, and Salazar (left to right).", "edited": 1430108389.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "SL", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; The Founders&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genre &amp;amp; Plot:&lt;/strong&gt; This fictional period drama, set at the turn of the first millenium, explores the lives of the Founders of Hogwarts.

The need for OCMs is highlighted by cases such as the [Ilfracombe Incident](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ilfracombe_Incident), when a dragon attacked a beach full of Muggle sunbathers, and several Muggle witnesses were not properly Memory Charmed. At least one Muggle, ['Dodgy' Dirk](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dirk) subsequently told other Muggles about the incident; though he was not taken seriously, this could have represented a serious breach of the Statue of Secrecy.

As such a minimum of Exceeds Expectations in NEWT level Charms is expected; other preferred qualifications are Exceeds Expectations in NEWT level Muggle Studies and Defense Against the Dark Arts; as well as an E in OWL level History. \n\nBenefits: Although individual Obliviators are trained to modify memories in such a way that the obliviated persons will not notice anything of note having happened at all, it can be extremely difficult to remove memories while explaining missing time. Further, false sets of memories may be questioned or refuted by 'second level witnesses' who did not necessarily encounter the magical world themselves, but in interacting with an obliviated person, note inconsistencies in their memory. Though Muggles are often able to dismiss or explain away odd happenings, it can raise unwanted questions if, for instance, a group of Muggles all find that they have concrete proof of being at a certain time and place, but no memories of being there. It is the OCM's role to craft a believable story that can explain such circumstances so that Obliviators can modify individual memories accordingly. This is especially important in an age of Muggle technology and exposure, to pro-actively prevent a buildup of evidence on the existence of the Magical world. \n\nRestrictions and Guidelines: The single most difficult aspect of this position is that it requires a highly detailed and up to date understanding of the Muggle world; a poorly constructed story may be more troublesome than outright amnesia. It also requires a delicate balance between ensuring that Muggle lives are not negatively impacted by any brush with the Magical world, while also stringently enforcing the Statue of Secrecy.

When did Trewlaney ever make a prediction that actually came true, huh? But whatever, I got notes from her class and everything so I might as well do this assignment. \n\nOk, so in my dream, I'm on vacation, on this crazy roadtrip with some random people, and somehow we're in Las Vegas. Sin City baby, and the party is on--the lights are bright, the drinks are good, the music is thumping. We are wandering down the Strip, seeing all the shiny, gigantic signs and monuments and fountains, though I feel like something's missing. I end up on my own and in one of the casinos, though I've never gambled with real money in my life. \n\nOf course that doesn't matter, I'm at a poker table, having faked my way into a game with higher stakes than I can afford. I'm laughing with all the glittery people seated by me, playing on automatic, barely looking at my cards. I get a good feeling on one round, and bet big. The pot gets pretty big, and it's down to me and one other guy, who turns out just to have a straight. I reveal my cards--I've got a flush: spades ace, ten, nine, seven, and two. Raising my arms in vaguely tipsy triumph, I know to quit while I'm ahead and leave with my winnings. \n\nWhen I leave the casino, the sun is bright and shining. Suddenly I hear a screech, and the flapping of wings. I see a huge falcon, blotting out the sun; it casts a huge shadow as it swoops down. The sky changes, darkening, and the air seems to become charged. Out across the desert and mountains I see the reason for the changing atmosphere: a huge, black, and ominous storm approaching. I realize what was missing earlier from the Vegas Strip--the recreation of the Eiffel Tower. I see the tower now, larger than everything else and looming on the horizon. There is lightning striking the tower, over and over. I wake with the sound of thunder in my ears. \n\n---\n\nOk, I'll be using [this reference](http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/) since I'm pretty sure Trelawney's never told us anything about Vegas (even though she totally looks like the type to be in some sherry and blackjack--it must get boring in that stuffy attic of hers). Let's see, Las Vegas means excess and overindulgence, and that \"emotional turmoil\" is clouding my good judgment, yadda yadda yadda what else is new? Travel is supposed to represent my daily routine and progress towards life goals. So if I'm dreaming of travelling to Vegas, maybe it means I'm overindulging in my daily life. Awesome, Divination just confirmed I'm a master procrastinator. \n\nWhat else? Well, gambling indicates that I'm impulsive, irresponsible, and relying too much on fate. Yeah, ok, I could get behind that, not all of us can be lucky wankers like Potter. Poker means I need careful planning and strategy to deal with situations. Maybe I'll draw up a battle plan to convince my little sister once and for all that there's no monster in her closet, and we can finally switch back to our normal rooms. Hmm, looks like the cards I had in the dream actually have significance too, maybe it corresponds to that tarot stuff? Seems that's it's all bad stuff though, ace of spades can be heartlessness; ten, seven, and two of spades are [violence, ill omens, and conflict](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cartomancy); nine of spades is [nightmares and despair](http://www.biddytarot.com/tarot-card-meanings/minor-arcana/suit-of-swords/nine-of-swords/). Well, that kind of sucks...~~good thing Divination is a bunch of hogwash, ahem.~~ \n\nTrelawney actually gave us interpretations for some of the stuff in the last part of my dream. A sun represents [great happiness](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Tessomancy), but a falcon indicates a deadly enemy, so a falcon blocking out the sun means an enemy is going to interfere with my happiness, and they're going to be 'deadly' haha. I'm not sure when an enemy popping up like a bad penny doesn't ruin happiness, but I guess that--hey, did you hear that? Uh, there was a weird thudding sound. And then a scratching?\n\nMeh, it's probably nothing. Anyway, a storm evidently [\"signifies some overwhelming struggle, shock, loss or catastrophe\"](http://dreammoods.com/cgibin/dreamdictionarysearch.pl?method=exact&amp;header=dreamsymbol&amp;search=storm). Gosh, this Divination stuff sure is uplifting and--jeez, there are those weird sounds again, and louder this time. When I'm done with this I'll go check it out, I guess, ugh, so comfy here. \n\nLast thing, the Eiffel Tower being struck by lightning, hey, that counts as a [lightning stuck tower](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Cartomancy). I know Trelawney talked about--huh, the closet door is open. I could have sworn I closed that...\n\n...\n\nh\n\ne\n\nl\n\npofnkdsl vmsa;k\n\nitsreal  \nstayaway\n\n&gt; The lightning-struck tower \u2014 \"calamity\" and \"disaster\"\n\nBonus illustration: http://imgur.com/wj3jwxs", "edited": 1422506665.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "SL", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I gotta say I was never really convinced by this Divination stuff.

Sin City baby, and the party is on--the lights are bright, the drinks are good, the music is thumping. We are wandering down the Strip, seeing all the shiny, gigantic signs and monuments and fountains, though I feel like something&amp;#39;s missing. I end up on my own and in one of the casinos, though I&amp;#39;ve never gambled with real money in my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course that doesn&amp;#39;t matter, I&amp;#39;m at a poker table, having faked my way into a game with higher stakes than I can afford. I&amp;#39;m laughing with all the glittery people seated by me, playing on automatic, barely looking at my cards. I get a good feeling on one round, and bet big. The pot gets pretty big, and it&amp;#39;s down to me and one other guy, who turns out just to have a straight. I reveal my cards--I&amp;#39;ve got a flush: spades ace, ten, nine, seven, and two. Raising my arms in vaguely tipsy triumph, I know to quit while I&amp;#39;m ahead and leave with my winnings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I leave the casino, the sun is bright and shining. Suddenly I hear a screech, and the flapping of wings. I see a huge falcon, blotting out the sun; it casts a huge shadow as it swoops down. The sky changes, darkening, and the air seems to become charged. Out across the desert and mountains I see the reason for the changing atmosphere: a huge, black, and ominous storm approaching. I realize what was missing earlier from the Vegas Strip--the recreation of the Eiffel Tower. I see the tower now, larger than everything else and looming on the horizon. There is lightning striking the tower, over and over. I wake with the sound of thunder in my ears. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, I&amp;#39;ll be using &lt;a href=\"http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/\"&gt;this reference&lt;/a&gt; since I&amp;#39;m pretty sure Trelawney&amp;#39;s never told us anything about Vegas (even though she totally looks like the type to be in some sherry and blackjack--it must get boring in that stuffy attic of hers).
