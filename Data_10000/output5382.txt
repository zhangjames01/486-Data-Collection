Feel free to take as much or as little of this as you think would fit for your campaign.\n\nAn important note is that not all Elturians are bound by the Creed Resolute, and therefore, bound by Bellandi's Pact. The only Elturians that are guaranteed to turn into Devils upon their death are those who actually took that Oath. Those include all who have actually sworn the Creed Resolute (and their descendants). This would include the Hellriders, the Order of the Companion, the officials of most major churches within the city, and all members of political office who had been sworn into office in the past 50 years.

These people are being put in an absolutely hopeless situation. Food, water, shelter, compassion... all are limited, and even without imps poking around and baiting people into acts of cruelty, desperate people do desperate, selfish, evil things. And don't forget to factor in the actual oppressive nature of the Hells themselves. I wouldn't go so far as to make every citizen roll a daily \"Pervasive Evil\" save (from the DMG: Every day spent in the Nine Hells, make DC10 Wisdom saving throw vs having your alignment change to lawful evil), but the plane itself has a will that it exerts on people. The Remix links it on a metaphysical level: The \"Goodness\" remaining in Elturel is all that's keeping it aloft above the Styx. When that last bit of goodness is snuffed out, the city will sink into the Styx, completing the Pact, and express delivering those non-Creedbound souls directly to the Styx.\n\n\nPersonally, I plan to elaborate on the following major factions in the city, each with their own rational set of goals:\n\n\n**Klav Ikaia's Bloodriders** - Vampirism is a very interesting way to throw a kink in the deliverance of these Creedbound souls. In the Remix, the death of a Hellrider (or similarly Creedbound individual) results in a burst of hellfire, and their reemergence as a devil, a Hellknight, completely skipping that soul's traditional journey through the Styx and rebirth as a lemure. That takes some liberties with established lore, sure, but I personally like it. I'm taking it a step further. My Ikaia will be delivering the pitch that his vampire spawn don't suffer the same fate of immediately becoming Hellknights as other living mortals do. After all, the Creed dictates that it lasts: \"...whether in life or beyond the veil of death...\", right? Undeath is a bit of a loophole to that. If heroes of Elturel wish to avoid the fate of immediately turning to a devil upon their death, they can just throw in their lot with Ikaia, swear fealty to him, and serve as his undead minions. (As for the fate of their immortal souls, after they've been staked through the heart? They're still bound for the Styx, imo, but it prevents the emergence of Hellknights in the remnants of Elturel.) Ikaia, of course, is both cunning and suave, but at his core, he is a bitter, angry shell of the hero that he once was before the vampirism took hold of him. He's spent the past fifty years living in the catacombs, subsisting off the blood of vermin, and for every minute of it, he has been plotting on how to reclaim power within the city, and how best to enact revenge on those who laid him low. His first step of turning the refugees of Shiarra's Market into human cattle/bloodbags is only the first step on his path towards building a force of loyal Bloodriders.\n\n**Hellrider Remnants** - Another way to stall the deliverance of Creedbound souls could be proper consecration and/or the application of Holy Water. If the forces of good were to properly defend the temple of Helm and were able to recover a few weapon/supply caches (see the Hellturel supplement), it's possible that there could be a halt to the emergence of any new Hellknights. At least, temporarily. Plus, if a proper resistance with the backing of the surviving Hellrider command structure was to form, who's to say what the outcome would be? Zariel would not appreciate that sort of insubordination. \n\n**Demonic Interlopers** - In the remix, the Gnolls (under the command of Liashandra) are aware of Elturel's fate, and have undertaken the task with sabotaging the completion of the pact. Of course, even with a Flind/Pack Leader like Liashandra, it's hard to reign in Gnolls when they get hungry. Kinda a recipe for disaster. There's also Baphomet's faction of minotaur (and associated demons), who could be there with ulterior/tactical motive, or could just be following the Gnolls to exterminate them, given the hatred between those two demonic factions. As for how they got there? There's the obvious demonic portal in the graveyard, but alternatively, sometimes in places of great chaos, the barrier between the Prime Material and the Abyss thins. A city falling into ruin and desperation as quickly as Elturel has is a perfect example of where this chaos is likely to accidentally tear a rift into the Abyss.\n\n**Devil Opportunists** - I really like what /u/JustSomeJokerYT had to say here. I might add that there's also possible interference from warlords who want to loot the city for material plunder, as well as the corruption of souls. Plus, Zariel would send agents to sabotage the Hellriders/Bloodriders, with the intent to prevent them from organizing a proper resistance and/or to halt their plans for consecration/desecration of the Creedbound (which might delay Zariel's receipt of those souls).\n\n**Zarielite Cultists** - For those cultists \"in the know\" about Elturel's fall, the Remix canonizes that many fiendish cultist would have made pilgrimage to for an express trip to Hell. There are a lot of cultists stirring things up and making things worse for people in general, and these cultists don't always have to have as much \"Law\" to them as actual Devils do.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole post will be assuming that your campaign uses the Alexandrian Remix.
