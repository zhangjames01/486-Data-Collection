He can lay the ball off, of course, but he isn't the sort to beat the man. \n\nBorini is supposed to cut in from the flanks and switch positions with Suarez. Suarez is supposed to have the options of passing it to either him or Gerrard, or run down the right, or hold the ball and let Borini's movement mess up the opposing defensive shape. Borini is pretty good at break offside traps, almost every goal he scored for Roma was from hanging off a defenders' shoulder.

He's too impatient to get the attack going all by himself. \n\n4. Gerrard has been playing out of his position. In the 4-3-3, the attacking midfielder isn't the box-to-box that Gerrard is used to, its a false 9 who's supposed to be the 2nd striker. Gerrard is supposed to do what he used to do with Torres, where he hung very close to him, but he has been dropping back for the ball too often. This means that when the ball reaches Suarez, Gerrard is either too far away thus eliminating a passing option, or Gerrard is in full flight thus the attack cannot be controlled. In addition, Gerrard has been reverting to his Hail Mary passes when things start to go wrong or when he starts to lose his patience. \n\nIf you listened to Rodgers' post-match conference, he mentioned the major problem to be decision-making.
