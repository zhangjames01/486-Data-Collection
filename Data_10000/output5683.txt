There are plenty of clue scrolls that existed ingame prior to the update that I&amp;#39;ve had to drop because I did not want to get the levels to complete it, so why should this be any different.  The two that come to mind are the regicide elf one that requires 56 agility to get to (53 boosted), and the fishing guild one that required 68 fishing (63 boosted) to access.  If this clue is removed from the game then both of those should be removed also because I, like you, want to be able to do all clue&amp;#39;s without putting in the effort to get the requirements to complete them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_28uye9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/2007scape/comments/28uye9/level_3_clue_scrolls_an_unpolled_change/cif02bu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/28uye9/level_3_clue_scrolls_an_unpolled_change/", "name": "t1_cif02bu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/2007scape", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1403545998.0, "created_utc": 1403545998.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/28uye9/level_3_clue_scrolls_an_unpolled_change/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wbww", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What's the luckiest thing that's ever happened to you in runescape?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "2007scape", "link_author": "itsyaboyshamoun", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "chqupv7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "krazy3", "num_comments": 33, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_26gk95", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_7mmnv", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Back around 2007, while doing the barrows some guy died and dropped full ahrims.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "woodcutting", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back around 2007, while doing the barrows some guy died and dropped full ahrims.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_26gk95", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/2007scape/comments/26gk95/whats_the_luckiest_thing_thats_ever_happened_to/chqupv7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/26gk95/whats_the_luckiest_thing_thats_ever_happened_to/", "name": "t1_chqupv7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/2007scape", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1401043012.0, "created_utc": 1401043012.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/26gk95/whats_the_luckiest_thing_thats_ever_happened_to/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I am Marc \"Tryndamere\" Merrill, President &amp; co-founder of Riot Games.
