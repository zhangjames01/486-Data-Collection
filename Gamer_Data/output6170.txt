This will allow you to tell your router, for example, to prioritize network traffic from specific applications (eg iTunes, Netflix, pornhub) or specific devices (if you have a smartphone, for instance) above the Xbox One. That way, your downloads on the Xbox won't be stopped, they'll just be given less bandwidth than other things until those other things stop and the Xbox has more room to stretch on your network.\n\nI'm sure this should go without saying, but doing this will lower your Xbox One's download speeds.
