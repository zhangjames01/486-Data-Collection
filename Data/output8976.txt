So we would be allowing ugliness of the following sort:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;enum Colour:\n    red, green\n\nclass SubColour(Colour):\n    blue = 3\n\nclass Colour(enum):\n    red = 1\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A different approach might be PEP 354:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weekdays = enum(&amp;#39;sun&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mon&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;tue&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;wed&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;thu&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;fri&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;sat&amp;#39;)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An unfortunate issue in this case is that the new enum would be unaware of its own identifier. So its type would have to be a generic &amp;lt;enum&amp;gt; instance, while we would prefer a new subtype &amp;lt;enum: Weekdays&amp;gt;. Adding the identifier leads to the current PEP 435 syntax:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weekdays = Enum(&amp;#39;Weekdays&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;sun&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;mon&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;tue&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;wed&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;thu&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;fri&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;sat&amp;#39;)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;d say that, given the way objects and types work in Python and the syntax limitations, this is pretty much the best you can expect at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1e504f", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/coding/comments/1e504f/pythons_sad_unimaginative_enum/c9x83m7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/coding/comments/1e504f/pythons_sad_unimaginative_enum/", "name": "t1_c9x83m7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/coding", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1368357092.0, "created_utc": 1368357092.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.acooke.org/cute/Pythonssad0.html"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rb2y", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The Silver Searcher: Better than Ack", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "coding", "link_author": "joelthelion", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c9uorfa", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "unfashionable_suburb", "num_comments": 25, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_c9unvhm", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_6b9sr", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;If people care about anything other than the average/median time, it's the maximum time and not the minimum time.
