I really enjoyed Peterson&amp;#39;s wines.  Dry Creek Winery has some good values and a beautiful tasting room.  Dashe is great, and of course there&amp;#39;s always Ridge who has been making amazing wine for decades.  Unless prices have sky rocketed in the last two years, you should find $20-30 bottles at all of those wineries (except maybe Ridge, but they&amp;#39;re not much over that).  If you&amp;#39;re set on Napa/Sonoma, hopefully others will have some suggestions for good values in the region.  I don&amp;#39;t spend a lot of time there so I can&amp;#39;t be much help in those regions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_7mlga7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wine/comments/7mlga7/budgetfriendly_sonomanapa_wineries/drv1dxe/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/7mlga7/budgetfriendly_sonomanapa_wineries/", "name": "t1_drv1dxe", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wine", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1514469919.0, "created_utc": 1514469919.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/7mlga7/budgetfriendly_sonomanapa_wineries/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rxqu", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Flat-top vs Arch-top, which is less likely to warp?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Luthier", "link_author": "son_of_the_stig", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dpg7bcd", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "son_of_the_stig", "num_comments": 3, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_7b7qsb", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3yns6", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks, I appreciate it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "kit", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_7b7qsb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Luthier/comments/7b7qsb/flattop_vs_archtop_which_is_less_likely_to_warp/dpg7bcd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/7b7qsb/flattop_vs_archtop_which_is_less_likely_to_warp/", "name": "t1_dpg7bcd", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Luthier", "author_flair_text": "Kit Builder/Hobbyist", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1510012023.0, "created_utc": 1510012023.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Luthier/comments/7b7qsb/flattop_vs_archtop_which_is_less_likely_to_warp/"}}], "before": null}}
