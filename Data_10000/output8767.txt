I will restate it so it is more clear:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did Paul have access to any more information, either through divine inspiration &lt;a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%201%3A11-12&amp;amp;version=NIV\"&gt;as he claimed&lt;/a&gt; or through word of mouth from men (opposed to the previously linked verse), than any other post-Jesus&amp;#39;s-death convert to Christianity?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And based on your earlier post I assumed the answer was no, so I asked the following follow-up:  In that case why should we treat the writings of Paul any differently than any other post-Jesus&amp;#39;s-death convert to Christianity up to modern times?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However since your negative answer seems to be in doubt I will add follow-up questions in case your answer to the original question is yes:  How then does Paul&amp;#39;s additional knowledge not support the prophecy that Jesus would return in human form prior to the death of his initial followers, which Paul seems to be stating in 1 Cor 7:25-31?  And does that not mean that said prophecy is a failed one?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11siqoh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DebateReligion/comments/11siqoh/paul_said_that_jesus_would_return_in_his_lifetime/jcgop75/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/11siqoh/paul_said_that_jesus_would_return_in_his_lifetime/", "name": "t1_jcgop75", "author_flair_template_id": "18b55682-94b4-11e1-8ce7-12313b0ce988", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DebateReligion", "author_flair_text": "Polydeist", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678990975.0, "created_utc": 1678990975.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/11siqoh/paul_said_that_jesus_would_return_in_his_lifetime/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3jp3p", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Church that promotes killing LGBTQ+ people now complaining about acts of violence against church", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 33, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "LeopardsAteMyFace", "link_author": "3mta3jvq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcgl4uf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Nymaz", "num_comments": 1437, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcg0bss", "score": 33, "author_fullname": "t2_67t8o", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; That comic is SFW\n\nSays you.
