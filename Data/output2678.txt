These are the English, British, Irish, Pictish, as well as the Latin languages; through the study of scriptures, Latin is in general use among them all.\n\n&gt;&gt;Haec in praesenti, iuxta numerum librorum, quibus lex diuina scripta est, quinque gentium linguis, unam eandemque summae ueritatis et uerae sublimitatis scientiam scrutatur, et confitetur, Anglorum uidelicet, Brettonum, Scottorum, Pictorum et Latinorum, quae meditatione scripturarum ceteris omnibus est facta communis. \n\nInterestingly, Stevens's 1910 translation of Bede also (mis-)translates \"gentium linguis\" simply as \"nations\". \n\nCertainly by the time of the Peterborough Chronicle, in the early twelfth century, this was a totally standard trope in histories of England. It is included in the description of Britain in the praface to Henry of Huntingdon's *Historia Anglorum*, who notes that the Pictish language appears to no longer exist (1.8; trans. Greenway):\n\n&gt;Five languages are in use in Britain: those of the Britons, the English, the Scots, the Picts, and also of the Latins, the last of which, through the teaching of the scriptures, has become common to all the others. The Picts, however, appear to have been annihilated and their language utterly destroyed, so that the record of them in the writings of the ancients seems like fiction.\n\n&gt;&gt;Quinque autem linguis utitur Brittannia: Brittonum videlicet, Anglorum, Scottorum, Pictorum, et Latinorum, quae doctrina scripturarum caeteris omnibus est facta communis: quamvis Picti jam videantur deleti, et lingua eorum ita omnino destructa, ut jam fabula videatur, quod in veterum scriptis eorum mentio invenitur.\n\nA similar point is also made by Geoffrey of Monmouth, but he discusses instead the five peoples who inhabit Britain: Normans, Britons, Saxons, Picts and Scots. (This may be drawing more, therefore, on the notion of the five invasions of Britain.)\n\nThis may also explain why Latin is associated with \"Boc\", and may suggest a more specific reference to scripture than merely \"book latin\" in some general sense.

These are the English, British, Irish, Pictish, as well as the Latin languages; through the study of scriptures, Latin is in general use among them all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Haec in praesenti, iuxta numerum librorum, quibus lex diuina scripta est, quinque gentium linguis, unam eandemque summae ueritatis et uerae sublimitatis scientiam scrutatur, et confitetur, Anglorum uidelicet, Brettonum, Scottorum, Pictorum et Latinorum, quae meditatione scripturarum ceteris omnibus est facta communis. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Stevens&amp;#39;s 1910 translation of Bede also (mis-)translates &amp;quot;gentium linguis&amp;quot; simply as &amp;quot;nations&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certainly by the time of the Peterborough Chronicle, in the early twelfth century, this was a totally standard trope in histories of England. It is included in the description of Britain in the praface to Henry of Huntingdon&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Historia Anglorum&lt;/em&gt;, who notes that the Pictish language appears to no longer exist (1.8; trans. Greenway):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Five languages are in use in Britain: those of the Britons, the English, the Scots, the Picts, and also of the Latins, the last of which, through the teaching of the scriptures, has become common to all the others. The Picts, however, appear to have been annihilated and their language utterly destroyed, so that the record of them in the writings of the ancients seems like fiction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Quinque autem linguis utitur Brittannia: Brittonum videlicet, Anglorum, Scottorum, Pictorum, et Latinorum, quae doctrina scripturarum caeteris omnibus est facta communis: quamvis Picti jam videantur deleti, et lingua eorum ita omnino destructa, ut jam fabula videatur, quod in veterum scriptis eorum mentio invenitur.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A similar point is also made by Geoffrey of Monmouth, but he discusses instead the five peoples who inhabit Britain: Normans, Britons, Saxons, Picts and Scots. (This may be drawing more, therefore, on the notion of the five invasions of Britain.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may also explain why Latin is associated with &amp;quot;Boc&amp;quot;, and may suggest a more specific reference to scripture than merely &amp;quot;book latin&amp;quot; in some general sense.

Sidwell&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Reading Medieval Latin&lt;/em&gt; is the most often recommended, but Harrington&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Medieval Latin&lt;/em&gt; is the other modern option and Beeson&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;A Primer of Medieval Latin&lt;/em&gt; is out of copyright.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11r676t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/latin/comments/11r676t/medieval_latin_readers/jc75sog/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/11r676t/medieval_latin_readers/", "name": "t1_jc75sog", "author_flair_template_id": "843f2bfe-d21d-11e4-8d86-22000b339334", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/latin", "author_flair_text": "Lingua balbus, hebes ingenio", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678807139.0, "created_utc": 1678807139.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/11r676t/medieval_latin_readers/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qloa", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I need help with translation/transliteration", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "latin", "link_author": "smelsbad", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jc49m6n", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "qed1", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jc2tp57", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4qu8g", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; It seems to come from a 15th-century work called the Breviarium in usum Sarum.\n\nIt also turns up in some late-15th century, continental printings of Hugh of St-Cher's *Speculum Ecclesiae* ([e.g.](https://books.google.fr/books?id=omXdAe9MyO0C&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PP34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)).

This reputation comes from the theory proposed by Hastings Rashdall for the origins of the University of Oxford in his magisterial *The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages*. Rashdall's argument begins from the assumption that a northern European university could not have emerged spontaneously without a sufficiently large ecclesiastical institution like Notre Dame in Paris. He therefore takes it as a given that we must search for the origins of the University of Oxford \"ab extra\" through the exodus of scholars from another educational centre. The only plausible candidate for such an exodus in the twelfth century is of course Paris and, as he discusses a few pages later, this must have occurred around the third quarter of the twelfth century as until then no more than one master can be found teaching in Oxford at any given time, and of course \"a single master does not make a university.\"^1 So the cumulative implication here is that an exodus of English scholars from Paris must have occurred roughly around the time of the Becket controversy in the 1160s.\n\nWith that goal in mind, Rashdall finds the basis for a highly speculative story about the foundation of a *studium generale* in Oxford through two ostensibly unrelated bits of evidence: A cryptic remark in a letter of John of Salisbury about the expulsion of foreign students from Paris in 1167 and a set of statutes that Henry II promulgated around 1169 as an attempt to limit the influence of the exiled Thomas Becket on the English clergy. \n\nRashdall has to perform some significant contortions to line these two up. On the one hand, John of Salisbury doesn't tell us what Rashdall want's to find, that Henry II recalled the English students from Paris. Rather, after John spends the majority of the letter discussing the Becket controversy, he notes that God has shown favor on his church as not only has Frederick Barbarossa given up his siege of Rome but Henry II has not headed his wicked advisors. This leads him to note that, if we are to believe the astrologers, the position of Mercury heralds a tumultuous year:\n\n&gt;&gt; While I don't put any stock in these empty visions, they do seem hold true at least in part, for various councillors of the Emperor have died: Rainald archbishop of Cologne, and the usurper of Mainz, the bishops of Li\u00e8ge and Regensburg, and many schismatic princes. Wars and sedition were aroused everywhere and Mercury was so low that France, the mildest and most civilized of all nations, expelled the foreign-born scholars. (Ep. 225; my trans.)\n\nOn the other hand, Henry's statutes are neither from the right year nor really about recalling scholars from France. The most recent editors describe the eight or so provisions thusly, with Rashdall citing the two bolded entries:\n\n&gt;&gt; Anyone found with a letter from pope or archbishop declaring an interdict on England is to be treated as a traitor; **no clerk or monk or the like is to cross the sea without an official letter, on pain of imprisonment**; there is to be no appeal to pope or archbishop, and no sending or receiving of mandates from or to those authorities; anyone willing to obey a sentence of interdict is to be exiled with his whole kin; the chattels of all who support pope or archbishop are confiscate; **all clerks with revenues in England are to return to the country on pain of sequestration**; Peter's pence is to be gathered into the royal treasury, not sent to the pope; the bishops of London and Norwich are to be amerced, and charged before the royal justices to answer for laying an interdict on the lands of the earl of Norfolk contrary to the Constitutions of Clarendon, and for promulgating the pope's excommunication of the earl in their sees without the king's licence.^2\n\nRashdall is forced to insist on the significance of John's rather vague remark by insisting that the association of this expulsion with the retreat of Barbarossa from Rome suggests that it must have been an event \"of European importance.\"^3 Likewise, while he concedes that the best sources date Henry's promulgation to 1169, other later sources date them to 1164 or 1165, so like maybe they had \"really ... been issued on a different date [like say] towards the close of 1167, when John of Salisbury's Letter must have been written [\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af].\"^4 \n\nSuffice it to say, and in answer to your second question, this argument is a stretch. It faced immediate criticism by Rashdall's contemporaries and the editors of the posthumous 3 volume reissue of his work (which includes a compilation of some of the spicier controversy to Appedix 1) felt the need to add new footnotes in this section of the text further qualifying Rashdall's reading of these sources.^5 And that more or less captures the tone of every scholar that I've been able to find who has looked at the matter with any modicum of care. This is highlighted really nicely by the scholarly output of Gillian Evans, who includes the Henry II/1167 story in the introduction to her 2005 biography of Wylif, but rather poignantly omits any comment about the year 1167 in her 2010 history of Oxford University.^6\n\nBesides the noted evidentiary problems, Rashdall also overstates the significance of Oxford in the twelfth century.^7 The reality is that in 1167 there is no reason to imagine that Oxford would have been the only or even necessarily the central place that a Parisian exile would have turned. Notably, we still have references to Northampton as the preeminent school for the Liberal Arts in England into the 1180s.\n\nBut, returning at last to the first question, we shouldn't entirely dismiss John of Salisbury's comment. As we can see, there is no reason to think that this expulsion, if it happened, had anything directly to do with either Henry or Becket. While I've not been able to find any especially compelling discussion of this particular point (though I've not been able to check the OMT edition of the letter, so if there's anything relevant to add there, I'll update the thread in a few days when I've been able to get a hold of the library's copy), the standard interpretation seems to be that this has to do with the war that broke out between Henry II and Louis VII that summer, with the suggestion that Louis thought that a large presence of English scholars in the royal capital might represent a liability. That being said, much like the scholarly assessment of Henry's 1169 ordinances, significant skepticism remains about whether this putative expulsion of foreign students ever actually came into force or had any real effect if it did.^8 We certainly don't have the evidence to suggest that it was the considerable movement of scholars that Rashdall wanted it to be.\n\n---\n\n1: Hastings Rashdall, *The Universities Of Europe In The Middle Ages* (repr. 1936) iii.22.

This problem is also discussed more widely by Cobban.\n\n8: Stephen Ferruolo, *The Origins of the University: The Schools of Paris and their Critics, 1100-1215* (1985), 284 and David Knowles, *Thomas Becket* (1971), 124.", "edited": 1678126885.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "12th Century Intellectual Culture &amp; Historiography"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like 1096, 1167 is one of those dates whose reputation casts a much greater shadow than its actual historical significance. This reputation comes from the theory proposed by Hastings Rashdall for the origins of the University of Oxford in his magisterial &lt;em&gt;The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages&lt;/em&gt;. Rashdall&amp;#39;s argument begins from the assumption that a northern European university could not have emerged spontaneously without a sufficiently large ecclesiastical institution like Notre Dame in Paris. He therefore takes it as a given that we must search for the origins of the University of Oxford &amp;quot;ab extra&amp;quot; through the exodus of scholars from another educational centre. The only plausible candidate for such an exodus in the twelfth century is of course Paris and, as he discusses a few pages later, this must have occurred around the third quarter of the twelfth century as until then no more than one master can be found teaching in Oxford at any given time, and of course &amp;quot;a single master does not make a university.&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; So the cumulative implication here is that an exodus of English scholars from Paris must have occurred roughly around the time of the Becket controversy in the 1160s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that goal in mind, Rashdall finds the basis for a highly speculative story about the foundation of a &lt;em&gt;studium generale&lt;/em&gt; in Oxford through two ostensibly unrelated bits of evidence: A cryptic remark in a letter of John of Salisbury about the expulsion of foreign students from Paris in 1167 and a set of statutes that Henry II promulgated around 1169 as an attempt to limit the influence of the exiled Thomas Becket on the English clergy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rashdall has to perform some significant contortions to line these two up. On the one hand, John of Salisbury doesn&amp;#39;t tell us what Rashdall want&amp;#39;s to find, that Henry II recalled the English students from Paris. Rather, after John spends the majority of the letter discussing the Becket controversy, he notes that God has shown favor on his church as not only has Frederick Barbarossa given up his siege of Rome but Henry II has not headed his wicked advisors. This leads him to note that, if we are to believe the astrologers, the position of Mercury heralds a tumultuous year:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;#39;t put any stock in these empty visions, they do seem hold true at least in part, for various councillors of the Emperor have died: Rainald archbishop of Cologne, and the usurper of Mainz, the bishops of Li\u00e8ge and Regensburg, and many schismatic princes. Wars and sedition were aroused everywhere and Mercury was so low that France, the mildest and most civilized of all nations, expelled the foreign-born scholars. (Ep. 225; my trans.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Henry&amp;#39;s statutes are neither from the right year nor really about recalling scholars from France. The most recent editors describe the eight or so provisions thusly, with Rashdall citing the two bolded entries:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone found with a letter from pope or archbishop declaring an interdict on England is to be treated as a traitor; &lt;strong&gt;no clerk or monk or the like is to cross the sea without an official letter, on pain of imprisonment&lt;/strong&gt;; there is to be no appeal to pope or archbishop, and no sending or receiving of mandates from or to those authorities; anyone willing to obey a sentence of interdict is to be exiled with his whole kin; the chattels of all who support pope or archbishop are confiscate; &lt;strong&gt;all clerks with revenues in England are to return to the country on pain of sequestration&lt;/strong&gt;; Peter&amp;#39;s pence is to be gathered into the royal treasury, not sent to the pope; the bishops of London and Norwich are to be amerced, and charged before the royal justices to answer for laying an interdict on the lands of the earl of Norfolk contrary to the Constitutions of Clarendon, and for promulgating the pope&amp;#39;s excommunication of the earl in their sees without the king&amp;#39;s licence.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rashdall is forced to insist on the significance of John&amp;#39;s rather vague remark by insisting that the association of this expulsion with the retreat of Barbarossa from Rome suggests that it must have been an event &amp;quot;of European importance.&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise, while he concedes that the best sources date Henry&amp;#39;s promulgation to 1169, other later sources date them to 1164 or 1165, so like maybe they had &amp;quot;really ... been issued on a different date [like say] towards the close of 1167, when John of Salisbury&amp;#39;s Letter must have been written [\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af].&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say, and in answer to your second question, this argument is a stretch. It faced immediate criticism by Rashdall&amp;#39;s contemporaries and the editors of the posthumous 3 volume reissue of his work (which includes a compilation of some of the spicier controversy to Appedix 1) felt the need to add new footnotes in this section of the text further qualifying Rashdall&amp;#39;s reading of these sources.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; And that more or less captures the tone of every scholar that I&amp;#39;ve been able to find who has looked at the matter with any modicum of care. This is highlighted really nicely by the scholarly output of Gillian Evans, who includes the Henry II/1167 story in the introduction to her 2005 biography of Wylif, but rather poignantly omits any comment about the year 1167 in her 2010 history of Oxford University.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides the noted evidentiary problems, Rashdall also overstates the significance of Oxford in the twelfth century.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; The reality is that in 1167 there is no reason to imagine that Oxford would have been the only or even necessarily the central place that a Parisian exile would have turned.

The Condemnation of 1277 named a number of books, as well as a list of 219 ideas.\n\nAristotle's works of natural philosophy were banned in 1210 as part of the condemnation of David of Dinant in the fallout from the controversy around the Amalricians:\n\n&gt;&gt;The quires of Master David of Dinant are to be brought to the bishop of Paris before the Nativity and burned, and neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy nor their commentaries are to be taught at Paris in public or privately, and this we forbid under penalty of excommunication.

It orders that the arts masters in Paris are not to use \"those books on nature, which had been banned in the provincial council [i.e. the above quotation] for specific reasons, until they have been examined and cleared of all suspicion of error.\" It then orders that the faculty of theology should not \"make themselves out to be philosophers but devote themselves to becoming learned in theology.\" \n\nOf note here, these are expressly limited to the city of Paris. Indeed, already in 1229 the newly, Papally(!) founded University of Toulouse was promoting itself as a place where people could come to study \"those books nature that have been banned in Paris\" (CUP 1:131). (They were also subsequently banned in Toulouse, but only in 1245.) \n\nIn any case, by 1255 the entire Aristitotelean corpus was included on the published reading lists for the Faculty of Arts at University of Paris. So whether or not the said commission of 1231 had concluded that the works were free of error, this was evidently no longer a serious issue by the 1250s.\n\nThe condemnations of 1270 and 1277 are therefore not adequately construed as a return to the banning of Aristotle from 1210. Rather, the central concern from the late 1260s was a set of interpretations of Aristotle based especially in the commentaries of Ibn Rushd, concerning things like the unity of the agent intellect and the eternity of the world. It is these so called Latin Averroists, especially Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia, who are typically interpreted as the key targets of the condemnations of the 1270s. (Although they are more wide reaching than that, and Thomas Aquinas himself is almost certainly another target in the condemnations of 1277.) In any case, the works of Aristotle per se are no longer at issue, but rather their interpretation, particularly within the broader context of the influential Arabic commentators, and the relationship of this natural philosophy to the work of theology. (This is really a more central through-line in the thirteenth century condemnations at Paris, which is of course at this point the preeminent school of theology in Latin Europe, especially as it relates to things like the relationship of the Arts and Theology faculties at Paris.)\n\nAlso /u/Greg_Alpacca.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "12th Century Intellectual Culture &amp; Historiography"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t really an accurate account of the history of these condemnations:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The University&amp;#39;s arts faculty were banned from reading or teaching Aristotle&amp;#39;s works on natural philosophy in 1210.
