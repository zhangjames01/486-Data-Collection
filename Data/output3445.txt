Symptoms were similar, my temp gauge was high at idling stop, when I would drive, the temp would go down to \u201cnormal\u201d operating temp. I suspected a faulty fan, turns out the fan was fine, fully operational. Took it to a shop in town, they diagnosed head gasket, they replaced the gasket, had the head resurfaced, coolant change, thermostat changed, and I was on my way. \n\nI love my Honda, before and after the head gasket failure, especially after, I\u2019ve been pretty OCD about maintenance. Oil changes anywhere between 3-4K miles, all fluids changed at recommended intervals, etc. \n\nFast forward to this year, so far I\u2019ve had my spark plugs changed, my AC, alternator, and PS belts changed (my timing was changed in 2018 about 40k miles ago) and I replaced my upper and lower hoses. I burped the cooling system and topped off the radiator and filled my reservoir half way between min and max. \n\nThe coolant hoses was about a month and a half ago. Since then I periodically drive my car. About a few times a week and lot long distances. When I would pop my hood, after anything more than a lengthy drive of 30 plus minutes, I\u2019d notice my rad tank was damn near empty. I checked my hoses no leaks, I checked beneath my car, no puddles of coolant, no visible coolant anywhere. I top my reservoir off and keep driving for a few more weeks. \n\nFast forward to tonight, I\u2019m waiting in a long drive thru line, I look at my dash and see my temp gauge is pretty damn high, i get home and I smell the scent of hot sweet coolant, I look around and see a lot of coolant splashed up on my engine, below the distributor cap, I also see spots of dried up coolant on my upper rad hose and my intake. \n\nMy worst fear is a cracked engine block and coolant is leaking from there. \n\nBased on what I\u2019ve said and these shitty photos, do any of you have prior experience with this and what did it end up being for your car? \n\nMy car has an original D16Y8 engine with 210k + miles on it. regular maintenance has been done on this car for years, plus a blown head gasket was repaired back in 2018. \n\nHelp.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I\u2019m feeling pretty down right now, I was waiting at a drive thru and noticed my temp gauge was getting up there in heat, about 3/4 of the way up, I blasted my heater until I could get home (about 20 minutes later). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve unfortunately had a problem similar to this before, back in 2018 my head gasket failed.

I burped the cooling system and topped off the radiator and filled my reservoir half way between min and max. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The coolant hoses was about a month and a half ago. Since then I periodically drive my car. About a few times a week and lot long distances. When I would pop my hood, after anything more than a lengthy drive of 30 plus minutes, I\u2019d notice my rad tank was damn near empty. I checked my hoses no leaks, I checked beneath my car, no puddles of coolant, no visible coolant anywhere. I top my reservoir off and keep driving for a few more weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to tonight, I\u2019m waiting in a long drive thru line, I look at my dash and see my temp gauge is pretty damn high, i get home and I smell the scent of hot sweet coolant, I look around and see a lot of coolant splashed up on my engine, below the distributor cap, I also see spots of dried up coolant on my upper rad hose and my intake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My worst fear is a cracked engine block and coolant is leaking from there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on what I\u2019ve said and these shitty photos, do any of you have prior experience with this and what did it end up being for your car? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My car has an original D16Y8 engine with 210k + miles on it. regular maintenance has been done on this car for years, plus a blown head gasket was repaired back in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ufdwo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Honda/comments/11ufdwo/my_engine_is_overheating/jcnyx7d/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Honda/comments/11ufdwo/my_engine_is_overheating/", "name": "t1_jcnyx7d", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Honda", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679118148.0, "created_utc": 1679118148.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://imgur.com/a/lpArr4w"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwwd", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Engine overheating", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Honda", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcnu1cy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ThatSpicyMeal", "num_comments": 2, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11uen76", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_bj8qu", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My engine starting overheating at a drive thru\n\nI recently changed my upper and lower rad hoses but did not change the thermostat. \n\nMy head gasket blew back in 2018 and got that fixed.
