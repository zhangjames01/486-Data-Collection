Understand this!  You were manipulated, tricked, fooled, and lied to by a man who was determined to control you. One of the best quotes from the book *Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men* by Lundy Bancroft:  \n\n\n&gt;In one important way, **an abusive man works like a magician: His tricks largely rely on getting you to look off in the wrong direction, distracting your attention so that you won\u2019t notice where the real action is.** He draws you into focusing on the turbulent world of his feelings to keep your eyes turned away from the true cause of his abusiveness, which lies in how he thinks. He leads you into a convoluted maze, making your relationship with him a labyrinth of twists and turns. He wants you to puzzle over him, to try to figure him out, as though he were a wonderful but broken machine for which you need only to find and fix the malfunctioning parts to bring it roaring to its full potential. His desire, though he may not admit it even to himself, is that you wrack your brain in this way so that you won\u2019t notice the patterns and logic of his behavior, the consciousness behind the craziness  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...whether you stay or go, the critical decision you can make is to stop letting your partner distort the lens of your life, always forcing his way into the center of the picture. You deserve to have your life be about you; you are worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know you love him, but consider this: **he does not love you or respect you the same way that you love and respect him.  Otherwise he would not be making you feel this way with his words and actions.**  You do not respect someone whom you abuse, and you do not abuse someone whom you respect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Someone please comfort me with some resources and tips because I can\u2019t sleep sitting here watching bluey way past when the kids went to bed.* \n\nu/awtcurtis  has already given you some great action items to work on.

I love this man so much but I have to divorce him. I cannot let him continue to treat me this way.

Understand this!  You were manipulated, tricked, fooled, and lied to by a man who was determined to control you. One of the best quotes from the book &lt;em&gt;Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men&lt;/em&gt; by Lundy Bancroft:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In one important way, &lt;strong&gt;an abusive man works like a magician: His tricks largely rely on getting you to look off in the wrong direction, distracting your attention so that you won\u2019t notice where the real action is.&lt;/strong&gt; He draws you into focusing on the turbulent world of his feelings to keep your eyes turned away from the true cause of his abusiveness, which lies in how he thinks. He leads you into a convoluted maze, making your relationship with him a labyrinth of twists and turns. He wants you to puzzle over him, to try to figure him out, as though he were a wonderful but broken machine for which you need only to find and fix the malfunctioning parts to bring it roaring to its full potential. His desire, though he may not admit it even to himself, is that you wrack your brain in this way so that you won\u2019t notice the patterns and logic of his behavior, the consciousness behind the craziness  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...whether you stay or go, the critical decision you can make is to stop letting your partner distort the lens of your life, always forcing his way into the center of the picture. You deserve to have your life be about you; you are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know you love him, but consider this: &lt;strong&gt;he does not love you or respect you the same way that you love and respect him.  Otherwise he would not be making you feel this way with his words and actions.&lt;/strong&gt;  You do not respect someone whom you abuse, and you do not abuse someone whom you respect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someone please comfort me with some resources and tips because I can\u2019t sleep sitting here watching bluey way past when the kids went to bed.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/awtcurtis\"&gt;u/awtcurtis&lt;/a&gt;  has already given you some great action items to work on.
