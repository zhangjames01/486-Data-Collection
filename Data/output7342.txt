answer:**\n\nThe best way *for sure* to know how your Internet speeds are performing is to plug your computer directly into the \"LAN\" port (i.e. using an Ethernet cable) on the Spectrum modem/router, and then use a site such as [https://speedof.me](https://speedof.me)  to test the download/upload speeds\n\nIf doing that results in lower speeds than you're paying for, then you have a Spectrum problem \u2013 If doing that results in satisfactory speeds, then you have a different problem\n\n**Longer, horribly-boring answer:**\n\nI'm not a huge Spectrum fan \u2013 so much, that any time service drops below 200mbps down / 20mbps up for more than 30 minutes, I (because I'm a horrible, terrible computer geek) trigger an e-mail to Spectrum Support to address the issue\n\nI can only speak for my service-area (west of Jackrabbit Lane), and excluding outages, I'm an idiot and my efforts have been for naught, as no e-mails to Spectrum Support have gone out for 1,174 days at this point\n\nYour location could be very different, not just in terms of Spectrum users near to you, but also people who are using Wi-Fi (Spectrum or otherwise) near to you\n\nAs a well-seasoned geek of over 30 years, allow me to explain:\n\nIf you're using Wi-Fi, it's worth knowing that many places in Bozeman currently suffer from a high-degree of \"wireless contention\":\n\nIn other words, there are *so damn fucking many* Wi-Fi access points (which I'll just call an \"AP\" herein) within a 150-300 foot radius of you, and also so many devices connected to them that are operating on various Wi-Fi frequencies/protocols, it's *very* possible your own AP and computer (Mac, PC, smartphone, whatever) are having a horrible time distinguishing the signal from the noise, and in turn it's causing your Internet to be slow\n\nIt's akin to if you were in a room of 100 people all talking at once, but you were trying to talk with only one of them: You'd hear bits and pieces, but overall the conversation would suck\n\nWi-Fi ends up working much the same way, regardless of if Spectrum gave you a brand-new router, even if that router is capable of speaking 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6 \u2013 And that's because *if* your computer(s) and other devices don't ALSO speak 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6, they will just use whatever they're able to. Likely an older, substandard protocol which can no longer work as good in today's world of Wi-Fi\n\nI keep mentioning 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6 because, even though it communicates on the same radio frequencies, it's EXTREMELY good at distinguishing between signal &amp; noise \u2013 much, MUCH better than previous Wi-Fi versions could \u2013 but it only works if BOTH your computer *and* router/modem are capable of speaking 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6\n\nIf your computer/laptop are older than 2020, you will likely need to buy a USB Wi-Fi adapter that is capable of 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6, or contact a computer tech service who can help you install a 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6 adapter card\n\nThere's a lot of complication here, but overall, what you need to know is that areas with lots of Wi-Fi APs and devices can be heavily congested with signals, and upgrading to a 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6 capable connection (on both your computer **and** router/AP) can make an enormous difference in your Internet speed experience\n\nHope that's helpful to you.
