That's just the time-slice the RTOS uses for its own control loop.\n\nISRs can be triggered at any rate you want.  Set up one of the timers to run at 20kHz if you want.  As long as you are careful, you can unblock a (presumably high-priority) thread from that ISR to hand over processing to a non interrupt context.  You have to instruct the RTOS to return from the ISR with a context switch check of course (so that your processing thread actually unblocks), but it won't sit and wait until the next 1kHz RTOS tick before it returns, it will return straight to that unblocked thread (assuming that thread is the highest priority of its options).  Now -- note that if that's the case, there is no context switch happening -- a decent RTOS will not make you pay for a context switch on return from interrupt if there has been no change of running thread, so you aren't context switching at a higher rate (as you would be with the higher RTOS tick frequency).\n\nBut ... let's say that that weren't the case, that even the decision not to context switch was taking too much time at your much higher fast interrupt rate (although on a 400MHz device, that would be a surprise IMHO).
