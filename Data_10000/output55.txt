Most adults with a semi rural or rural background, and even some city folk, consider it a good investment to keep one around the house, as they tend to control the number of flies and mosquitoes present. Also good for controlling Redbacks (Black Widows) and White Tips, which bite like the Brown Recluse you might be familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll occasionally come across large House Spiders too, and roaming wolf spiders during rains, looking pretty fearsome head on or with their young clinging to their back, but as a general rule, as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t pose a particular threat to you or your family, it&amp;#39;s best to let it go about it&amp;#39;s business. It&amp;#39;s just another animal doing it&amp;#39;s best to survive, after all, and whatever it&amp;#39;s eating would have been a nuisance to you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - If you&amp;#39;re Australian, and you grow up around Arthropods, you generally develop a benevolent respect for most of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_14ej1p", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/14ej1p/why_are_so_many_people_scared_of_or_disgusted_by/c7cjwik/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14ej1p/why_are_so_many_people_scared_of_or_disgusted_by/", "name": "t1_c7cjwik", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1354853552.0, "created_utc": 1354853552.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/14ej1p/why_are_so_many_people_scared_of_or_disgusted_by/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Scientists and engineers of Reddit: have you ever had a potentially catastrophic moment in your lab?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "StubbA", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c7cfc8l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Cypriotmenace", "num_comments": 2927, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_c7ce4pz", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5s8h8", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not really; it actually contributes to their kinetic energy.\n\nIf you were to compare say, solid metal and hydrogen in these terms, it'd be easiest to envisage pushing 2 people, one skinny as a stick and one obese.
