As an anti-New Urbanite, it pains me to see this massive amount of waste just to make North Face-clad yuppies feel good about themselves (making it fall into the same category as &amp;quot;awareness campaigns&amp;quot; and other nonsense). I&amp;#39;m sure that as a New Urbanite, it should pain you as well for more or less the same reasons (and even more so since it completely subverts the actual goals of the movement). The movement has simply become a parody of itself: let&amp;#39;s shove roundabouts and traffic calming in old neighborhoods that never had traffic issues in the first place while building massive &amp;quot;mixed use&amp;quot; developments that are at 20% occupancy due to excessive rents (which can only be filled with &amp;quot;mixed income classes&amp;quot; with massive government subsidies) and where everyone still leaves in the morning to drive 40 minutes to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;m not at all against actually redeveloping the inner city to be more liveable and am optimistic that near future technologies like driverless electric taxis can really make that work well. I just despise the wasteful shit that is happening in suburban zoning boards across the country. I&amp;#39;ve seen this &amp;quot;greenfield New Urbanism&amp;quot; horse shit happen in both Zoned Zone and Flatland.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2kgtbw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/2kgtbw/oil_price_will_fall_to_70_a_barrel_in_2015/cllvzlk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2kgtbw/oil_price_will_fall_to_70_a_barrel_in_2015/", "name": "t1_cllvzlk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1414471208.0, "created_utc": 1414471208.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-price-will-fall-to-70-a-barrel-in-2015-goldman-sachs-says-1.2814041?cmp=rss"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qt55", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Underwater BRAHMOS missile launch", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "gifs", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cj65xyu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ElectricRebel", "num_comments": 1177, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cj65bva", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3ghop", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You make two assumptions in this post:\n\n* The people that started those wars did so for the purposes of protecting national security.\n* That self-preservation is not a motive for the \"drunkards\".\n\nThe following are more likely true...\n\n* Because of the US's vast technological superiority in basically every area of combat, its national security is not threatened by anything (outside of accidental nuclear war).

This involves doing things like register allocation (deciding which variables to keep in memory and which to keep in the CPU registers) and peephole optimization (recognizing combinations of instructions that can be better represented by a more complex instruction, e.g. combining multiple addition instructions into Intel's SSE3 vector processing instructions).\n4. Assembler generates binary object files. This is essentially a direct transformation of the assembly language.

Linker combines binary object files with system libraries to generate complete binary program in a format the operating system knows how to execute (e.g. ELF)\n6. When the user runs the executable, the operating system creates a process, loads the binary instructions and data from the executable file into memory, and then lets the program take control of a core for a certain amount of time.

As each program executes, the CPU core interprets each instruction and performs the needed operations.

Let&amp;#39;s assume for a second that someone has a zero-day and is scanning a large IP range looking for computers to pwn. In that case, the non-standard port can help if they are only looking for computers that respond to port 22 or port 80. Yes, it is trivial to circumvent if someone already knows the computer is there, but that is not the point I was making.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1hb3by", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1hb3by/securing_a_linux_home_server/cawsiii/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hb3by/securing_a_linux_home_server/", "name": "t1_cawsiii", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1373079060.0, "created_utc": 1373079060.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hb3by/securing_a_linux_home_server/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Securing a Linux Home Server?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "linux", "link_author": "OmegaHarvest", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "caw1b8x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ElectricRebel", "num_comments": 129, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_casu3dz", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_3ghop", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Security is about making the cost of penetrating your system too high for it to be worthwhile.
