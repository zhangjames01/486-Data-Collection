As a Celtics fan, I was at the 2002 comeback game against your NJ Nets, so your slander is funny.\n\nI've had this Draymond take since before 2016 and [talked about it in 2017.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6p4fn3/draymond_greens_electric_response_to_conor/dkmxfff/) Draymond--unless he stays relevant in the media--won't hold up 25 years from now.\n\nIt's not really a hot take...it's common sense. There's only so many players to remember. Why would a fan remember the 3rd -- and sometimes 4th or 5th best player -- from the Warriors dynasty in the year 2045? They'll remember Steph and Klay. There will be many more actual superstars from now until then to occupy our imagination.\n\nAs I said in 2017, Draymond is firmly in the second camp of star player...the Rodman, Gasol, Parker, Ginobili camp. It's a FANTASTIC camp, but one that will be forgotten by the \"casuals.\"\n\n&gt; He's the 3rd to 4th best player on his team. Casuals may forget about him until the playoffs. You gotta remember that this sub is like the 99th percentile of NBA nerdom.\n\n&gt; Ask yourself this, what causals could name the 3rd best player on the Bulls teams...or the Lakers teams or Spurs? Jordan, Pippen, Kobe, Shaq, Duncan and Robinson get remembered. Steph and Durant will be too.\n\n&gt;The Rodmans, Gasols, Horrys, Fishers, Parkers and Ginobilis are discussed by the \"real\" hoops fans. Draymond will fall into this camp too.\n\nI love arguing with other folks on here about who's a casual and who isn't haha.
