As I am sure is the case of most redditors, in the past, I have been in your shoes, in addition to those of your [pissy] friend and your non-alcohol drinking friend. I'll cut to the chase:\n\nThere are two things at play here:\n1.) You're a solid friend and a decent human being. You went out of your comfort zone, acted in a way you never have before.\n\n2.) Your friend responded to you and your actions in a manner that you perceive to be a.) unexpected, b.) unwarranted, and c.) uncharacteristic of him.\n\nAnswer:\nIt's the alcohol. Your friend, who has been drinking (and presumably getting drunk) for months, isn't phased because it's not that big of a deal. I use the word \"phased\" because more often than not, that's exactly what teenage/high school drinking is: a reckless phase in a teenager's life where they first begin to experiment with a socially-acceptable intoxicant. Alcohol's effects manifest themselves under the influence of your unique biology and psychology, which is to say, your experience will be unique to you and is yours alone to handle. Good news is that all of your peers and everyone that has been in your peer group (rest of humanity) has gone through the same thing; bad news is that this is something you will have to deal with for the rest of your life.\n\nYour story is far more common than you realize, as were both your and your friend's actions. More often than not, these types of experiences go hand-in-hand with alcohol usage. Sometimes there is a tradeoff between experiencing those amazing bonding moments with friends and handling the \"chores\" of staying up all night doing what you think is right to convince yourself your friend/s are okay (one can argue those \"chores\" are bonding moments themselves).\n\nBeing a young man, you can leave this situation in a number of ways:\n1.) Become a teetotaler. You don't have to preach about it or exclude yourself from social gatherings (you certainly can if you'd like) but you abstain from using alcohol for the remainder of your life.\n\n2.) Get some sleep. Recognize your friend was drunker than you were and as such, couldn't hold his shit. Think twice about sharing a tent with your friend in the future (some dudes, no matter how hard they try, can't help pissing themselves when they get really drunk. The best dudes are able to laugh at this fact and arrange themselves for sleeping accordingly). Convince yourself to try alcohol again, but \"engineer\" the experience so that you can drink to the point of drunkenness in a safe place and repeat; this process is called 'getting your sea legs' and is essentially becoming comfortable with alcohol, its effects ON YOU, and practicing/developing a behavior pattern that makes the experience enjoyable for your and those around you. If you do it right, you and your friend will be able to laugh at the situation earlier this morning in time and maybe you'll be able to introduce your non-drinking female friend to the concept of responsible indulgence and teach her how to engineer her experiences to her benefit like yourself.\n\n3.) One-up your friend. Start smashing moonshine and do some pissing of your own. The more drunk you get the less you will be embarrassed by this pursuit and the less creative you will have to be about finding things to piss on (not to mention the less time you will have to wait to build up an appreciable amount of piss).\n\nWhatever you decide, know one thing: this is only the beginning. Respect yourself, respect the choices you make, and respect the likely and inevitable consequences your actions bring. Alcohol may be a double-edged sword, but you can choose how you want to wield it or you can not pick it up altogether. You do not have to consume alcohol in order to be a man, but you do have to respect it. Different situations and social groups call for different behaviors and responses; regardless of whether or not you're drinking, stay aware and act accordingly.\n\nYou definitely do not need to consume alcohol in order to have a full and happy life, but it may facilitate the process. Have a happy New Year.
