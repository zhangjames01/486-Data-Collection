A standard tub/shower surround is 60\"x30\", so you can reduce it quite a bit. That entire wall could come in at least 3'.\n* Your dining room is very large and could be reduced at plan north and west.\n* Your laundry room is far from your closet.

You could then attach the garage directly to your kitchen wall and eliminate the breezeway. **(Edit: this won't work if you don't have a laundry room upstairs)**\n* Your office doesn't have any windows. Your master bath has too many. There's a street-facing window in the shower.\n* Your garage is very large. Recommended dimensions for a two-car garage are 24'x24\u2032.\n* Your powder room is very far from every room other than the office. It'll be a trek to go to the bathroom from the kitchen.\n* If there's no basement, you could move your powder room to where your pantry is and use the door under the stairs, and use the current powder room for storage. Eliminate the bump-out coat closet.\n* Pocket doors are expensive. Use swing doors in your master bathroom. \n* Your kitchen has very limited counter space.  \n* This is a personal preference, but I wouldn't center the fireplace. You'll end up hanging your TV over it, which isn't ideal.
