Even reading the wikipedia of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod you can see the huge impact this has on the body. Don't read the few diaries on MMT and think you are getting a good picture of the situation. If you want a good idea of the inevitable complications the majority of patients will face doing cheap externals then this is a good thread http://www.limblengtheningforum.com/index.php?topic=5.0.\n\nI am currently undergoing leg lengthening in Guragon India with Dr Sringari. OP I would recommend you do the surgery, but, only if you can afford internal methods. I believe Dr Jamal is a good option for cheap (40-50k) internals if not then Guichet or Paley. Externals are not worth it unless you suffer height discrimination on a day to day basis and can't afford internals and are willing to take the risk. Many patients including myself regret doing the surgery despite being incredibly adamant it was the right decision beforehand. The scars, the impact on the ankle and knee, the prevalence of nerve damage (one patient has to stop at 2.5cm), seeing other patients have serious complications and knowing that at every x-ray you could likely be told that you will have to have another surgery (happened to me) for any number of reasons, that the surgery will take an extra two+ months(again very common) or that you will suffer from lifelong issues. Reading that 50% will suffer from lifelong knee pain and 35% arthritis combined with the fact that I have knee pain that hasn't improved in the time I've been lengthening really is taking a mental toll.\n\nExternals are atrocious and I regret doing this surgery along with many of us in the guesthouse with me. Apologies for my shit writing style its 1:15am and I am bed ridden across the other side of the world in pain and no one to talk to. In hindsight I should have seen a psychiatrist (as soon as I leave I will be seeing a psychiatrist) about my debilitating height neurosis. I let the comments of a few girls get in to my head and thrash my life in a disastrous direction. I feel ashamed of myself.\n\n\n\nAs a side note why are there heaps of 5'9 posting here.

Even reading the wikipedia of &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod\"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramedullary_rod&lt;/a&gt; you can see the huge impact this has on the body. Don&amp;#39;t read the few diaries on MMT and think you are getting a good picture of the situation. If you want a good idea of the inevitable complications the majority of patients will face doing cheap externals then this is a good thread &lt;a href=\"http://www.limblengtheningforum.com/index.php?topic=5.0\"&gt;http://www.limblengtheningforum.com/index.php?topic=5.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am currently undergoing leg lengthening in Guragon India with Dr Sringari. OP I would recommend you do the surgery, but, only if you can afford internal methods. I believe Dr Jamal is a good option for cheap (40-50k) internals if not then Guichet or Paley. Externals are not worth it unless you suffer height discrimination on a day to day basis and can&amp;#39;t afford internals and are willing to take the risk. Many patients including myself regret doing the surgery despite being incredibly adamant it was the right decision beforehand. The scars, the impact on the ankle and knee, the prevalence of nerve damage (one patient has to stop at 2.5cm), seeing other patients have serious complications and knowing that at every x-ray you could likely be told that you will have to have another surgery (happened to me) for any number of reasons, that the surgery will take an extra two+ months(again very common) or that you will suffer from lifelong issues. Reading that 50% will suffer from lifelong knee pain and 35% arthritis combined with the fact that I have knee pain that hasn&amp;#39;t improved in the time I&amp;#39;ve been lengthening really is taking a mental toll.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Externals are atrocious and I regret doing this surgery along with many of us in the guesthouse with me. Apologies for my shit writing style its 1:15am and I am bed ridden across the other side of the world in pain and no one to talk to. In hindsight I should have seen a psychiatrist (as soon as I leave I will be seeing a psychiatrist) about my debilitating height neurosis. I let the comments of a few girls get in to my head and thrash my life in a disastrous direction. I feel ashamed of myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a side note why are there heaps of 5&amp;#39;9 posting here. When I used to come here there were no 5&amp;#39;9.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false,
