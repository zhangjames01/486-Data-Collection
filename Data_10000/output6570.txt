The stuff it needs can't and won't be addressed just in season 2, I'm a realist. But the biggest things I think the game needs:\n\n\\- Forge. But not just Forge. Forge has to come with robust social features, a solid and easy to use file share system, custom games browser, more custom games options, and customs to actually work.\n\n\\- A progression system. But with it, we need an easy way to display our progression, service records and an easy way for others to see them -- for both of these the most apparent solution is a pre-game lobby. We need ways to display our achievements through various means, what our highest ranked playlist rank is, how many games we've played, highest level of difficulty we beat the campaign, etc. Preferably we'd have a per-playlist progression that we can only climb when we win matches in that playlist (win = 1 EXP, lose = no EXP), in addition to a global progression that takes everything into account, both multiplayer and even campaign.\n\n\\- We need actual meaningful ways to unlock armor and weapon coatings/skins/pieces, preferably something that is non-linear to go with the linear battle pass. This would be things like getting a gold BR (or even crazier skins like some with particle effects and all) after hitting 5,000 kills with it, or getting a particular helmet or armor core for playing X amount of matches. Stuff like that that is separate from a weekly challenge system, something that spans the entire life of the game.\n\n\\- Game modes + weapons. We need both. We can't have infection play properly with the current shotty, and idk how Grifball would play with the current hammer. For example, if you just up the damage on the shotty to make it a 1sk, then its fire rate is too high and it wouldn't play right. We also need the best possible combination of playlists for the game modes.\n\n\\- A new game mode or multiple game modes that offer a unique experience to Halo Infinite. I am fully aware that making new modes isn't easy. But even just adding a playlist designed in a way that 343 can easily rotate beta game modes, or modes in testing, no matter how crazy they seem, where players can just go to have fun and try stupid shit, and then give feedback on what they like or didn't, could help guide them in creating different experiences, as well as add more content to the game. Not everything added has to be compatible with HCS/ranked settings. That's a big problem H5 and Infinite both share.\n\nThere are more things, and there's also the obvious desync and other connection-related issues that need to be addressed, but just adding Forge, or just adding a progression system isn't enough. We need all the other supporting features to come with them, and I'm hoping this is the real reason Forge has been delayed so much and not just because Forge itself isn't ready yet.\n\nThis is why I'm so disappointed with 343, they know these are the things the game needs, but we can't get a clear answer on them.
