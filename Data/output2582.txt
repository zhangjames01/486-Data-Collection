That's what fascinates me about fitness culture in general: The ability to overcome yourself through sheer willpower.

People ask me, \"What are your goals?\" But I'm not sure. I got into fitness just to be fit, to be able to get into my 60s and still be able to do the things I love (I'm 30 now) - and there are other perks, of course! But I love weightlifting.

With such a wide-ranging routine, I'll probably never be the strongest guy at the gym, run a marathon, or bike a century. Am I OK with that? I don't know yet. I lift M-W-F, run 5K with a fun run group Tuesday and Thursday, then usually throw in a bike ride or two over the weekend. I'm not outstanding at any of those pursuits - in my runs, for example, I haven't been able to regularly get better than an 8-minute mile, or have the energy to do anything more than four miles in a single run.\n\nDoes anyone else juggle a varied routine with success?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys!
