If that were true then Mitch McConnell would have passed all kinds of conservative nonsense when he had the majority during the Trump administration. Instead all he could pass were the tax cuts for the rich.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;51 senators are required for a quorum. If Schumer tried to pass controversial legislation like BBB then all it takes is for a single GOP senator to show up and demand a quorum and then walk out. 51 senators are required when a quorum is called. With only 50 Democrats, the quorum call would fail and no legislation can pass: &lt;a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/96-452\"&gt;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/96-452&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason that Schumer can ram through executive appointments without Republicans is that most of the nominations are non-controversial (random Ambassadors, Assistant Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, judges in liberal states, etc). Mitch McConnell and the Republicans basically agreed to not interfere with those votes so no quorum was called and they can proceed with fewer than 51 senators. Democrats often didn&amp;#39;t interfere with Trump&amp;#39;s non-controversial executive appointments too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_rjzeyf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/rjzeyf/sanders_let_manchin_vote_no_on_build_back_better/hp8yeqk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rjzeyf/sanders_let_manchin_vote_no_on_build_back_better/", "name": "t1_hp8yeqk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1639968448.0, "created_utc": 1639968448.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/586456-sanders-let-manchin-vote-no-on-build-back-better-in-front-of-the"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r5rp", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "You would think \ud83e\udd14", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "facepalm", "link_author": "monaleeparis", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hmvmdb8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "winampman", "num_comments": 5130, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hmuvyc2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_38bpc", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;Arm the teachers that are competent or hire security in schools.\n\nTeachers are not police officers that are trained to deal with multiple types of threats.
