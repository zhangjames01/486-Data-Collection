You can always do their taxes for them twice, once with the business and once without and give them back the difference. You structure your web site and company identity to make you appear to be an employee, sales and IT pro. Throw in some doppelgangers to answer emails and collect invoices. Hire fellow students to help with jobs when need be (for cash). Mark up work by at least 100% with half up front to cover equipment and supplies as needed (no overhead is gospel). Approach small companies to do installation, on site service and training. Volunteer at old folks homes doing email, web cam classes. Use PayPal to accept credits cards, get a magnet sign for your card door.
