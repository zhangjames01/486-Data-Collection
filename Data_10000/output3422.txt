Im fact I believe when they realised it was at all sexually transmitted (again not straight away) they thought any sex could cause it and many people were angry and upset at the idea of having to essentially take a step back and not love openly, to them it wasn\u2019t that simple. Perhaps some people could have been more careful but it\u2019s such a complicated situation we can\u2019t really understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, please educate yourself before making such bold comments. Maybe watch The Normal Heart, it\u2019s fictional but largely based on what was happening in New York to the writer, and even with that you\u2019ll understand a little more how it was a chain of events that could have been significantly different if things were handled differently, particularly if those in power cared, but they didn\u2019t because the majority of victims were LGBT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: of course it wasn\u2019t all up to Americans to find cures and it was a worldwide epidemic, cures  and medications that help take a long time but there\u2019s no doubt that there was a huge direct impact, at least to American citizens, that those politicians actions had. Lack of education about prevention being a large factor to that. And again, to say it\u2019s all the fault of people that had unprotected sex is ignorant to say the least, when people were dying and getting sick at an alarming rate before they even knew what was happening. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_a2dtmo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/lgbt/comments/a2dtmo/we_wont_forget_them/eay0y7y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/a2dtmo/we_wont_forget_them/", "name": "t1_eay0y7y", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/lgbt", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1543779717.0, "created_utc": 1543779717.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/3w48s8l8pv121.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhh7", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How insightful", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "lgbt", "link_author": "canadiankhaled", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eah9g5v", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tinbloom", "num_comments": 279, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eagpzbn", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_bg36d", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep, we have a similar issue here in the UK.
