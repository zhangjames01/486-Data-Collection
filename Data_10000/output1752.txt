The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996  (the CPPA), however, expanded that definition to include sexually explicit images that merely appear to be children, regardless of whether the subject is in fact a child or in fact real. In 2002, two sections of the CPPA were challenged in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition . The suit involved the language of two specific sections of the CPPA, \u00a7\u00a7 2256(8)(B) and (8)(D):  \n\n&gt; 2256(8)(B): \u2026 such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is, or is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;\n\n&gt; 2256(8)(D): \u2026 advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression [it depicts] a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\n\nCongress was attempting to avoid the sexual exploitation of children \u2013 the aim that had been the goal of anti-child-pornography legislation from the beginning, and the aim that had been resoundingly endorsed by the Court in Ferber. However, as the Free Speech Coalition pointed out, the legislature had gone beyond that goal and was now in the realm of proscription of \u201cspeech that is neither obscene under Miller nor child pornography under Ferber.\u201d   \n\nThe problem for the court was that Congress had simply stepped too far \u2013 virtual pornography, as it was called, is a far cry from the conduct at issue in Ferber. One of the issues in Ferber (number 2(a) above) was that the conduct was an actual record of a crime \u2013 sexual abuse. But the CPPA prohibited speech that did not in fact record a crime; moreover, it harmed no children . The latter issue was, writ large, the entire rationale for Ferber\u2019s departure from Miller, and the Court took issue with Congress\u2019 attempt to criminalize speech beyond Ferber\u2019s rationale without comporting with the test laid out in Miller.  \n\nImmediately after the Court\u2019s decision in Ashcroft, Congress enacted the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the PROTECT Act) .

Current legislation is a hybrid Miller-Ferber test:  \n\n&gt;Any person who, in [communication, transportation, or territorial jurisdiction] knowingly produces, distributes, receives, or possesses with intent to distribute, a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting that:\n(1)\t(A) depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and \n(B) is obscene; or\n(2)\t(A) depicts an image that is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in [sexual activities] whether between persons of the same or opposite sex; and\n\t(B) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value .\n\nSubsection (c) crystalizes Congress\u2019 intent to overturn Ashcroft:  \u201cIt is not a required element of any offense under this section that the minor depicted actually exist .\u201d Only time will tell if Ashcroft will stand as the Court\u2019s dominant position on child pornography. One commentator criticizes Ashcroft, stating first that the Court failed to recognize a compelling government interest in preventing indirect harm; second, that the Court\u2019s opinion abandons the substantial overbreadth standard, the harm theory from Ferber itself, the proximate cause theory of Chaplinski, and the distinction between high and low-value speech from Miller; third, that Ashcroft creates a heavy burden for the government in child-porn cases; and last, creates confusion in the lower courts. \n\nAt present, the Court seems comfortable with the proscriptions as announced in the PROTECT Act . The question, then, is whether Ferber\u2019s per se categorization of child pornography will survive into an era where technology makes the production of virtual child pornography relatively easy and does not embody the same concerns (i.e. the recording of harm) raised in 1978. Or more simply, will the law evolve to conform to our moral disgust of child porn , or will the law couch the harm as one of encouraging prurient views of childhood innocence?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An actress who is 18 who produces porn with an 18-year old actor where both are presented as being both 15 is very likely unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a longer explanation, with the caveat that I wrote this in 2013:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For nearly fifteen years post-Ferber, Congress deferred to the conceptualization of the Supreme Court as to what constituted child pornography. The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996  (the CPPA), however, expanded that definition to include sexually explicit images that merely appear to be children, regardless of whether the subject is in fact a child or in fact real. In 2002, two sections of the CPPA were challenged in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition . The suit involved the language of two specific sections of the CPPA, \u00a7\u00a7 2256(8)(B) and (8)(D):  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2256(8)(B): \u2026 such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is, or is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2256(8)(D): \u2026 advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression [it depicts] a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Congress was attempting to avoid the sexual exploitation of children \u2013 the aim that had been the goal of anti-child-pornography legislation from the beginning, and the aim that had been resoundingly endorsed by the Court in Ferber. However, as the Free Speech Coalition pointed out, the legislature had gone beyond that goal and was now in the realm of proscription of \u201cspeech that is neither obscene under Miller nor child pornography under Ferber.\u201d   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem for the court was that Congress had simply stepped too far \u2013 virtual pornography, as it was called, is a far cry from the conduct at issue in Ferber.

If the question is susceptible to a longer answer, then the witness gets to answer the question posed.\n\nThere are other strategic reasons in trial you might want to not object. My favorite is to let a witness ramble nonresponsively and make it clear to the jury by my body language that I am ignoring the answer. Then the follow-up (well, repeated) question is: \"Sir, please listen to the question this time... my question was, isn't it true that...\" This shows the jury that the witness didn't answer the question and suggests that the witness avoided answering deliberately.\n\nNext - the way you interrupt the witness is important. Hand to god I have seen attorneys get frustrated with a witness and preface a open-ish question with a hand in the air: \"yes or no, yes or no, did Mr. A *deliberately* do that?\" That is what makes jurors cringe. Same thing in the answer - I have seen attorneys all but hopping into the well at the witness doing that same weird hand up gesture: \"yes or no, that's a yes or no question!\" That just looks stupid. The best way to interrupt a witness is politely and firmly: \"Excuse me, sir. That's not the question. My question is...\" \n\nBut now your witness is pissed. They will sometimes try to argue with you that they were answering the question. That's not testimony and there was no question to the witness: \"Objection, your honor. There was no question - move to strike everything the witness just said and I'd ask for a curative instruction to the jury.\" Now your witness is really pissed, *but this is the goal.\" Your next follow-up reframes the issue they tried to avoid:\n\nQ: You testified earlier that you saw a tall man in a black shirt run from the scene of the accident; do you recall that testimony?  \nA: Yes.  \nQ: Isn't it true that on the night of the accident, you also told police that you saw a short man in a green shirt run from the scene of the accident?  \nA: Well from where I was standing, I could only see the back side of the car and the guy in the black shirt came around first...  \n[Objection, sustained, stricken, curative instruction]  \nQ: You saw a short man, green shirt, yes?  \nA: Yes.  \nQ: And he was running, right?  \nA: Yes.  \nQ: And he was running away from the scene of the accident, right, not towards it?  \nA: Yes.  \nQ: And you told the police what you saw, right?  \nA: Yes.  \nQ: So when I asked earlier if you told police you also saw a short man in a green shirt running from the scene of the accident, the answer is yes?  \nA: Yes. \n\nAnother technique that I love employing when a witness is dissembling on what should be an easy answer... If you have asked a yes/no question and the witness tries to avoid it, then your follow-up is simple:\n\nA: [evasive or rambling]...  \nQ: So the answer is yes.\nA: Yes.\n\nNote - be careful and try as hard as possible to phrase the follow-up positively, so you aren't forced to \"clarify:\"\n\nQ: So the answer is no.  \nA: Yes.  \nQ: ... uh... yes the answer is no, or do you really mean no the answer is yes?  \nA: What is the question?  \nQ: I don't know either.\n\nAnd last... you don't need to limit your cross to questions to which you know the answer. There are certain advanced techniques that only come with practice. The two that you are most likely to come across in the mock trial context are (1) the lie; and (2) the bad investigation.\n\nFor the first... if you can expose a witness' bona fide lie, exploit it. By a bona fide lie, you need (1) a misrepresentation; (2) that was knowing; and (3) is material. If you establish these three things, follow up by asking the witness: \"why did you lie to the jury?\" If the witness attempts to offer a justification for doing so, exploit that too: \"So you had that explanation, and instead of offering it, you *chose* to lie - why?\"\n\nThe second requires thinking a bit faster on your feet. It's fishing for gaps in the State's investigation, and its most effective if you have some investigative misstep you already know you can show. Little things that the officer could have done, maybe did, maybe didn't do, and that aren't in his report or really something that would come up in an interview. This is stuff that comes to you mid-trial. You're listening to direct, hear some testimony, and think - I wonder if the cop did XYZ... So on cross:\n\nQ: Those gloves used in the murder, the ones from the maintenance shed... did you ask the head of maintenance who all had access to the shed?  \nA: No.  \n\nIf you get the good answer, leave it alone and move on. Then argue the point in closing. If you get the \"bad\" answer:\n\nA: Yes.  \nQ: As would be appropriate, right?\n\nAnd then move on.\n\nLast point about cross. Sometimes you don't need cross. Example - say you have a theft case where the alleged theft is on video. It's plain from the video that the product in fact simply slid off the cart's seat and into the defendant's open, bigass tote purse below while she was looking the other way and not even touching the cart [side note, this was a real case - actually happened]. If the asset protection manager takes the stand and testifies how furtive her actions were and how obvious it was that she was stealing.... why bother crossing him? The only thing that he can do is walk back his absurd story, which you are free to argue away in closing.\n\nHere's the TL;DR - I'm not saying your coach is wrong... just probably overgeneralizing because it's mock trial. The real goal of cross is to take command of the courtroom and present as much favorable evidence as you can through that witness.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First part... you can&amp;#39;t limit the witness to a yes/no answer by interrupting them unless you have asked a truly yes/no question.

It&amp;#39;s plain from the video that the product in fact simply slid off the cart&amp;#39;s seat and into the defendant&amp;#39;s open, bigass tote purse below while she was looking the other way and not even touching the cart [side note, this was a real case - actually happened]. If the asset protection manager takes the stand and testifies how furtive her actions were and how obvious it was that she was stealing.... why bother crossing him? The only thing that he can do is walk back his absurd story, which you are free to argue away in closing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the TL;DR - I&amp;#39;m not saying your coach is wrong... just probably overgeneralizing because it&amp;#39;s mock trial. The real goal of cross is to take command of the courtroom and present as much favorable evidence as you can through that witness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10qgatu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/10qgatu/question_regarding_conduct_towards_witnesses_in/j711vxu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/10qgatu/question_regarding_conduct_towards_witnesses_in/", "name": "t1_j711vxu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Ask_Lawyers", "author_flair_text": "WA - criminal, family, and marijuana", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675412772.0, "created_utc": 1675412772.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Lawyers/comments/10qgatu/question_regarding_conduct_towards_witnesses_in/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vbli", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Hey Seattle (and surrounding) residents, which shop/business do you think is a definite money laundering fake business?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "SeattleWA", "link_author": "sleeplessinseaatl", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6qx14o", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "justcallmetarzan", "num_comments": 666, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10qec2s", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_9c57n", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The Sarajevo Nightclub, but I think 10+ years ago it was the Sarajevo Lounge.
