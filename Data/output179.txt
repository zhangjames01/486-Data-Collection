Think about painting in layers if that helps.  \n\nThat being said, here's my recommendation.  You skin is your canvas so you gotta take care of it.  Pay attention to your body/skin, everyone is different so use what is working for you.  Exfoliate regularly, exfoliating helps clear up pores and scrub away dead skin.  I do it daily, again do as much as your own skin needs to.  My pores tend to clog easily so I try my best to keep it clean. I use something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Earth-Therapeutics-Exfoliating-Body-Sponge/dp/B0006NZ2G8/ref=sr_1_17?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368162722&amp;sr=1-17&amp;keywords=exfoliating+bath+sponge), just a slightly rougher bath sponge, squeeze a little [face wash](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Oil-Free-Acne-Wash-Ounce/dp/B001E96OU6/ref=sr_1_5?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368162810&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=neutrogena+face+wash) on it and lightly scrub - again this is what I do, your mileage may vary.\n\nRegardless of how oily your skin is, moisturize it.  If you have naturally oilier skin like me, use a lighter moisturizer (it feels lighter on your skin not as thick or creamy).  conversely, use a heavier moisturizer if you tend to have dry skin.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a \"face moisturizer\" product, lotions work also i've noticed.  The point of all this is you want a clean and hydrated skin, it looks younger and healthier. I use, [Aveeno's Men's After Shave Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-After-Shave-Lotion-Fragrance/dp/B00B6A8K78/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368159257&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=aveeno+after+shave+lotion).  It get's two birds with one stone for me, aftershave plus helps keep my skin hydrated and is on the lighter side (won't feel greasy when it dries.)\n\nThe next layer in the painting would be concealer and foundation.  Concealers are more pigmented \"cover up\" work.  Using me again, i have slight rosatia/pinkness, concealers help neutralize out the redness to a more even skin tone.  Foundation is a less pigmented but does the same thing essentially.  Go to a Walgreen's or any drugstore and just look at the color samples.  You'll want to color match to your neck so that your general face color blends in with your neck.  Taking care of you skin takes time to get but when you get there you shouldn't need much concealer or foundation to even out your face.  I like [BB Cream No. 23](http://www.amazon.com/MISSHA-Perfect-Cover-Cream-Natural/dp/B0027A7CLG/ref=sr_1_4?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368159759&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=bb+cream+21), Natural Biege, matches my color fairly well.\n\nYou can pick either of those up or an equivalent product at any drugstore.  People won't give you any grief, it's not too common but some males do buy coverup/concealers for acne breakouts so it shouldn't cause too much fuss to buy in person.\n\nAs far as applying blush, eyeshadow, liner brows ... the works, it's hard to type out and is best if shown to you.  Beating a dead horse, watch the you tube videos and practice putting them on.  You WILL get better. I did a quick look through amazon, this [Shany Set](http://www.amazon.com/SHANY-Cosmetics-Makeup-Reusable-Aluminum/dp/B004BPVF7W/ref=sr_1_9?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368159862&amp;sr=1-9) seems like an okay kit.  It has a various color pots to play/practice with.  (color pot, the little containers that the actual make up sits in.)  Your small round pots are your eyeshadows and the large round ones are your blushes.  It looks like it comes with the applicators too, the fancy q-tip looking things are for eyeshadows and the bristle brush for blush.  It also has the standard black and brown pencil eye liner, a pencil lip liner, lipstick and some nailpolish.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, you've read all that you can or watched all the videos you've cared to watch.  My best advice I can give you is take care of your skin and practice.  Keep putting it on, get a feel for it and learn how certain things get applied.  Eyeliner for example, you need to get used to the fact that there's something that close to your eye when you're trying to put it on.  With time and practice it gets easier, your hand gets steadier and your eyes don't flinch as much.\n\nNot my best nor my worst, but here's where i'm at on a typical day. http://i.imgur.com/C1vPsxg.jpg\n\nLastly, baby wipes or makeup [remover wipes](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Makeup-Remover-Cleansing-Towelettes/dp/B0010XUU9M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368161538&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=make+up+remover) is good for taking it all off and [these](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Hydrating-Makeup-Remover-Lotion/dp/B0037MQAE8/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368161538&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=make+up+remover) on a cotton swab is good to remove eyeliner without any trace.\n\nEdit: words and links\n\n", "edited": 1368163025.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "(o^-^o)"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your face is a canvas and the make-up is like paint.

People achieving the results they wanted or minor effects that were desired with minimal to no bad side effects.  I don't know if \"bad for your liver\" is the right term, rather you're putting more hormones, more \"stuff\" into your blood and your liver and kidney's have to work harder because they have a certain level programmed into them they want to maintain.  That being said, liver or kidney's that work harder are more likely to fail.\n\nThe only true advice i'd offer is, it's really up to you.  If you do decide bone up on the subject, /r/asktransgender has a lot of self medicated posts (posts for both full on transition and minor changes).\n\nI'd like to add, there's a lot of non invasive things you could do to help promote more feminine changes.  Getting plenty of rest, lots of water, regularly changing sheets and pillow cases more often, moisturizing, etc are all the little things I do and my skin has softened and cleared up quite a bit.  I drink a lot of tea, specifically wintergreen tea, helps make my skin not so oily.  I mean it still is but it helps, and whether or not it's placebo, i believe the tea helps with it.\n\nTL;DR Do what you gotta do to feel happy/content with your self but be sure to read up before you do things that could do more harm than good.  /r/asktransgender has a lot more helpful folks on the topic of home supplements for full transitions as well as minor changes.\n\nEDIT: Also, I\"m pretty certain the directions to take estrogen supplements as directed are geared mainly towards female biochemistry and would not show correct dosage for a male to take.", "edited": 1350966475.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "(o^-^o)"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary, but generally it&amp;#39;s considered bad to mess with your hormones without a doctors guidance.
