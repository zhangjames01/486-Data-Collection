First of all, this thread is fantastic, and there is a ton of great advice in here. You did an excellent thing posting this and *genuinely* seeking out advice. That's a huge strength and it might just save you from a lonely resentful life.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is work on developing your interests. The best advice I ever heard was \"in order to be interesting you have to be interested.\" Women want to be able to have a conversation. They want to hear about the things you're excited about. They don't want to hear a lecture or sit through a one-sided tirade about something. But they want you to have content to your interests. Gaming and music (vaguely defined) won't go very far.\n\nSo start reading books. It might be painful at first if you're not already a reader. But if you can read even 10 pages a day, and *genuinely* try to meet the book on its own terms, *genuinely* try to discover why someone might love that book, then you will gradually become a more interested - and by extension interesting - person.\n\nWhat books? Lots of them and lots of variety. Make absolutely fucking sure you include books by women and people of colour. Here are some absolutely incredible books to consider: Kindred by Octavia Butler, A Visit From The Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan, Woman on the Edge of Time by Marge Piercy, The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde (it's a play but it's ridiculously funny), The Shipping News by E. Annie Proulx, Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood, As We Have Always Done by Leanne Simpson, Norwegian Wood by Murakami. \n\nI could go on. The point is to read books that you *aren't* immediately drawn to -- because those books will offer insight into experiences that you've never had and that you'll struggle to understand. And going through the struggle to understand them even a little is *exactly* what will help you grow as a person, what will help you develop greater empathy, what will help you expand your interests and become a genuinely interesting person.\n\nIn a very indirect and subtle but actually substantial way... reading is sexy.\n\nSo go get a library card. Forget about dating for a year or two. Take a long walk every day to gather your thoughts. And read like your sex life depends on it, because it does.\n\nSide note: audiobooks absolutely count. If that's an easier way in for you, just start listening to books. The important part is the variety of experiences and stories that you expose yourself to and that you *make a real effort to understand.*", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, I just read most of this thread and I feel like I have a good sense of where you&amp;#39;re at and where you can go from here.
