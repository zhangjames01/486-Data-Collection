I&amp;#39;ve been a lawyer for about 15 years and appear in front of a number of state and a few Federal judges.   At least one classmate from school has already been elected a judge. For the most part professionally this doesn&amp;#39;t matter all that much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amongst the federal Judiciary there is a heavy concentration of Ivy League law graduates. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brett Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law School in 1990.  He is a same year classmate of at least three other Federal judges, and if you expand to the year in front and behind him, you can include four five more federal district judges, the current Secretary of health and human services,  the current director of the FBI, Senator Chris coons, representative Frank Tejeda, and a handful of other notables. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the idea that Brett Kavanaugh lived in a house with seven people and one of them is now a federal judge in Texas is not hugely significant.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since Trump I have lost almost all confidence that government figures will maintain a sense of professionalism when you are talking about political issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11sy1li", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/11sy1li/judge_who_could_decide_trumps_fate_was_kavanaughs/jchjdl6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11sy1li/judge_who_could_decide_trumps_fate_was_kavanaughs/", "name": "t1_jchjdl6", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679002781.0, "created_utc": 1679002781.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.newsweek.com/brett-kavanaugh-roommate-james-boasberg-judge-trump-investigation-1788261"}}], "before": null}}
