As far as I know, science hasn't found any water-activated taste receptors nor ion channels in the tongue that directly stimulate the neurons/nerves necessary to initiate taste in higher brain centers. You can read further about taste transduction online. Taste transduction is a highly active area of research.\n\n&gt;2. Regulation of hydration is a very primitive necessity as compared to the need for sugar, umami, and especially the avoidance of bitter compounds. Salt and acid (sour) are transduced through ionic mechanisms in the tongue and, therefore, appear to predate the G-protein coupled receptor for the other 3. CO2 has recently been added to the list and appears to operate through coupling to sour sensation.\n\n&gt;Back to the point, your body has many ways of regulating hydration. The network is robust and, therefore, there appears to be no selective pressure to develop taste reception for water. But, new findings may prove me wrong.\n\nRelevant [follow-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/k16n5/dear_reddit_why_doesnt_water_have_a_taste_like/c2gqq53) courtesy [finwyn](http://www.reddit.com/user/finwyn)\n\n&gt;Water has a flavor but not a taste. Taste is sweet, sour, bitter, salt and Unami. These act on specific taste receptors resulting in a neuronal signal . But they are not the only receptors within the mouth. There are also pain receptors, that when stimulated, give the spiciness of hot pepper. Flavor is mainly taste and smell, but it is also affected by colour, texture of the food and temperature. So when we drink water, what we are 'tasting' is really the sensation of the texture of the water and also its temperature. Just the texture alone is enough for us to identify it as water if we had our eyes closed.\n\n&gt;If a water source is contaminated, then our taste receptors would pick whatever is contaminating the water source.

The aim here is to cool the room down.\n\nRelevant comment courtesy [Skulder](http://www.reddit.com/user/Skulder)\n\n&gt;Both of those are better than pointing the fan at you.\n\n&gt;Keep in mind that the fan creates undirected suction on the back, so it draws air in from all over the place - even in front of the fan.\n\n&gt;If you place it in the window to blow air in, the further out the better. If you place it in the window, blowing out, it'll take some of the outside air, and blow it straight out again.\n\n&gt;The stream of air that the fan creates in front of it, is highly directional, and pulls in more air around the airstream. If you place the fan as far away from the window as possible, it'll pull hot air into the airstream as it passes through the room and out of the window.\n\n&gt;There is no one true best place, but with this knowledge, you'll be able to find the best solution for your room.\n\n&gt;Overall, the good options are:\n\n&gt;* in the window, blowing air at the farthest corner of the room\n\n&gt;* in the farthest corner of the room, blowing air out the window.\n\nRelevant [follow-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/j10hl/cooling_a_hot_room_with_a_fan_and_a_window/c28a57q) courtesy [Azurphax](http://www.reddit.com/user/Azurphax)\n\n&gt;As a recent math/physics graduate, I approve this message as I have been doing this style system for years\n\n&gt;Only modifications:\n\n&gt;Sometimes it seems better to aim a little bit to the side of that furthest corner (when pointing in) to start a swirling motion to the air in the room, hopefully moving some of that hot upper air around enough to get out.\n\n&gt;As far as \"dissipating all the energy\" from leaving the fan deep within the room pointing towards the window, the very center of that airflow (the axis of the cone) will be accelerated by the flowing air around it, of course how much depends on the shape of the flow and changes depends on fan... I like blower-style because they rock at this. SOME air will be flowing where you are pointing out the window, and that airflow will draw nearby air.

Not life. They are NOT alive like cells/bacteria/fungi.\n\n&gt;* They replicate. They DO NOT reproduce. Life (cells/bacteria/fungi/humans) reproduce. Machines/particles replicate.\n\n&gt;* They NEED a host to infect. Without a host, they are useless. They are nothing. They can't do anything. They replicate using the host's machinery, energy, proteins, etc.\n\n&gt;* The simplest virus is nothing more than a single strand of infectious positive-sense RNA, very similar to the mRNA that your cell produces normally, but with different instructions (to produce more viral particles). It's like feeding your computer instructions to run virus code instead of your normal program code.
