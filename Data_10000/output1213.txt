since none of their obviously amazing and innovative ideas worked, and end up at another company they can drive into the ground with the same tactics, using their &amp;quot;experience&amp;quot; with Kongregate to arrive highly recommended for the task.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11dhw1m", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/incremental_games/comments/11dhw1m/incremental_epic_hero_2_kongregate_launch/jav9xyf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/11dhw1m/incremental_epic_hero_2_kongregate_launch/", "name": "t1_jav9xyf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/incremental_games", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677922846.0, "created_utc": 1677922846.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/11dhw1m/incremental_epic_hero_2_kongregate_launch/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhk3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The reason men don't get therapy or talk to people isn't because they want to be \"manly\", it's because most people don't give a shit about them (and therapists have a bias favoring women).", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "MensRights", "link_author": "DemolitionMatter", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jalmgiy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Mitschu", "num_comments": 342, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jal1l76", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_71pul", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Also, when picking a male therapist, look for three words after their name to run away from. \"Anger Management Specialist.\"\n\nThat's the majority of the options out there for men by default, and it REALLY isn't helpful to be told about how your behavior is harmful *to others* when you're the one with a sword to your throat trying not to draw it across.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, when picking a male therapist, look for three words after their name to run away from. &amp;quot;Anger Management Specialist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the majority of the options out there for men by default, and it REALLY isn&amp;#39;t helpful to be told about how your behavior is harmful &lt;em&gt;to others&lt;/em&gt;

Mechanics, balance issues, core gameplay conceits, raw ideas, all that.\n\nFor example, if you're going to have any kind of stat system, you need to keep in mind balance. Rock paper scissors is a classic game that exists in almost every culture (jankenpon in Japan, shou shi ling in China, schnick-schnack-schnuck in German, in parts of the US they call it \"Rochambeau\" after a count who according to legend used the game to defeat an opponent during the American Civil War, so on, so forth) for a reason -- it's perfectly balanced.\n\nHOWEVER, it's also pretty boring because of that perfect balance. There's a reason why so many variants exist, and why mostly children and drunks play it.\n\nIn reality, you need to keep in mind the different gameplay styles of players, and build the balance around that.\n\nFor example, a player who dedicates all their points to speed and consistent damage is saying \"I don't care if I win or lose, just that I clear the encounters I do have quickly.\" They play to hit the wall, then quickly reset, then hit another wall soon, then quickly reset, so on, so forth. Less strategy, little long term planning or goals, just a grinding mindset. The balance of speed stats should therefore keep that in mind. For players, the stats governing speed should make grinding levels and rewards quicker, but only to a certain extent before they have to reset and go again. For enemies, the stat should be a soft wall against players who dedicate too little into stats that raise their survivability.\n\nGlass cannon / all or nothing builds rely on random strikes that deal massive damage to eventually push past enemies, while still averaging somewhere consistent enough to get them to that point where they struggle. They're willing to spend more time on each reset, if it means they might get lucky and push just a bit further this time. With enemies, that stat serves as a slightly harder check that you have enough raw potential to overcome that barrier.\n\nDefensive builds tend to be the long haul. They have the mindset of \"sure, every battle is tink tink tink, thwack, tink tink tink, thwack, tink tink tink... but EVENTUALLY I win.\" This is where balancing point for point, Rock Paper Scissors style, will actually fail you. Why would anyone EVER invest in a build that takes forever to win a fight, when that build has the same chance to win as a build that decides everything in a few seconds?\n\nDefensiveness should be rewarded because it isn't just the stat points spent, but the promise of investiture of time. The player is saying \"I'm willing to spend 30 seconds per enemy, if it means I make it to wave 50 eventually.\" not \"I'm willing to spend 30 seconds per enemy instead of 0.5 seconds per, to make it to the same wave 33 I made it to last time.\" Likewise, defensive enemies are a hard gate against min-max, top speed strats. To overcome them, you either need a bunch of prestiges under your belt, or a really good strategy to overcome them.\n\nAnd that's before you get to hybridization (say, a very fast aggressively defensive build? Such as lifesteal % per attack.) and how that should impact the balance. Or meta builds, like going pure luck to get the best drops possible to save for later, making no progress this reset in order to build up better future resets. Etc.\n\nSuffice it to summarize: every stat should not just be competitive compared to other stats, but competitive in a particular playstyle compared to other playstyles. Don't think of CON as just \"enough HP and armor to take this much enemy STR damage\", but rather \"HP and armor enough to 'you are filled with determination' aplenty to defeat bosses you really shouldn't be facing yet... if you wait long enough.\" Don't think of SPD as \"this many attacks per round\", but \"how many attacks per round would be quick enough to get to a fair prestige benchmark for active play?\"\n\nEdit: A good example of doing this right AND wrong at the same time would be \"[Sword Fight](https://tovrick.itch.io/sword-fight)\". The game tries its best to be balanced and make all builds equally viable, and early game you do want a decent mix of all stats, but eventually (around the point you can consistently pick the type of enemy to face) the combat always devolves to an optimization game of \"build the fastest striker you can, and ignore that the game tells you that speed beats defense, defense gets off too many lucky counter attacks and has way too much health, eventually all that matters is you either win in one shot or die in one shot, so go speed vs speed all the time, that way you get more XP and gold per second on average than from any other build.\"", "edited": 1672537479.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of playing games, combined with years of grumping &amp;quot;a child with a crayon could do that better&amp;quot;, combined with years of never committing to game dev and thus being less than a child with a crayon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They used to have a &amp;quot;Mind Dump Monday&amp;quot; thread here: I&amp;#39;m not sure why it spontaneously got discontinued, but I used to be prolific there.

There are many games that already fit that mold (gain levels, earn loot, repeat), I'd recommend heading over to [the Plaza](https://plaza.dsolver.ca/games?keyword=rpg) and giving them a quick glance over to see what they do very well and what they do frustratingly poorly. Or, just pick up any mainstream RPG and skip through the plot segments, which is where the genre sorta started out.\n\n1) The UI is very important for this genre. There have been flame wars over tabbed / multipage interfaces versus modal / popout interfaces versus all-in-one / scrolling interfaces.\n\nIt comes down to personal preference (I'm a fan of tabbed interfaces, so I'll use that in my examples below), but the biggest things everyone mostly agrees on is:\n\n* relevant elements should be together: we shouldn't have to navigate through a maze of different tabs to use related elements of the game. If I gain experience on one screen, use that experience to level up on a second, use those levels to assign skill points on a third, also use those levels to pick skills on a fourth, and so forth, it's not good design.\n\n* design around relative scalability / be considerate of the variety of devices people play games on. This isn't to say every game must have a different design for mobile, web, and desktop deployment, but rather: if I click to play a game and the first thing I have to do is zoom out to 25% to get everything to fit on one screen, and there isn't a good reason why there are sixty fixed rows of upgrades that are required to be side by side instead of grouping them together dynamically based on my resolution, then I'll nope out.\n\nTruthfully, this \"consider the audience\" mindset for design has been around forever, there's no reason why modern devs continue to ignore it. I remember reading articles on how to design web pages and applications for difference environments back in the late 80s. Back before we even HAD options or tools to mitigate it, and it was an actual chore that required you to jury-rig complicated hacks together to figure out how to get your program to show up the same on a Commodore as it would on a Sinclair. Not a few lines in your CSS that you copied and pasted from a snippet reservoir. (UPHILL BOTH WAYS.)\n\n* Clean and contrasting. This isn't Myspace. All elements of the UI should mesh together well. Dark backgrounds, light foregrounds. Vice versa for dark mode. Crisp fonts, readability, all that. That means: no Comic Sans lime text on magenta backgrounds. On the subject of fonts, for many games that involve numbers going up and changing rapidly: fixed width is a must for those numbers. Think digital clocks. It may seem unimportant that 1 is thinner than 5 in most fonts, but when those numbers are changing rapidly every second, it goes from being easily readable at a glance to being a hell of bouncing, jiggling numbers that give you a headache.\n\nSame thing with decimal places: It hurts the eyes and boggles the brain to go from 4.99 to 15.996 to 123.0 to 1009936.5 to 100826, etc. Limit to significant numbers (typically hundredths or thousandths place, and magnitudes of a thousand) to make it easier on us.\n\n2) (in order of presentation)\n\n* Rebirth / prestige is not strictly necessary, but in games of this nature, yes, we're used to the idea of looping the content over and over again to make bigger gains to push past further walls to loop the content again to make bigger gains... again, not strictly necessary, and there's a fair argument to be made that the concept is overdone, but it IS a staple. It tends to work best when the rebirth mechanic is tied to a significant growth element in the game (so say if you have leveling up units as something you can do during a run, then ranking up those units to a higher tier is something you might to offset the pain of restarting from level zero) or mechanics unfold as a direct result of prestiging past milestones.\n\n* Gacha. Be careful with that. Some people love loot boxes, other people hate them with a passion. Some people think of it as a fun mechanic that adds the thrill of randomness and 100% completion challenges, others consider it a gambling mechanic that abuses Skinner's Box principles to \"reward\" player's developing an addiction. ESPECIALLY in this genre, which is essentially \"distilled dopamine on demand\", it's a controversial addition. ESPECIALLY if you add any kind of IAP / pay2progress feature.\n\n* AFK progress. People love the idea of not wasting their time, but honestly, offline progress has never truly been implemented well. Either the values go up too much too quickly from active play to make passive gains worth anything, or you are \"choice-gated\" behind decisions that you cannot make while offline, ergo you hit that wall and then all your afk progress from there on becomes pointless.\n\nMost people prefer \"offline time\" systems for that reason. For every X minutes we're offline, give us Y minutes of toggleable double gamespeed time. That way we can \"catch up\" meaningfully, but still experience the sense of progress and achievement for clearing certain hurdles.\n\n* IAP. \"Competitive advantage without being a Paywall\" is an oxymoron. All IAPs that affect the game itself are pay2win elements. No exceptions. What's worse is, devs think that by restricting cheating in their games, they can then charge money for cheats they provide, and that is ethical. I've ranted about this before, but to keep it concise: if ten seconds in Cheat Engine can get me what you expect $5 for, then you're telling me that your **intentionally induced artificial scarcity** is worth a heapload of real money. (Not the game itself, which is free -- the motte / bailey that so many devs hide behind.) That that *ten seconds* of my time saved (often by restricting me from investing that time) is realistically worth, oh, ~$1,800 an hour. And yes, suckers fall for it all the time. Doesn't make it ethical.\n\nIf you want to introduce IAP, then put simply: *do the work*. Either admit up front that your game costs money to play (and slap a price sticker on the box), have exciting new mechanics and elements that are purchased-only (back in the day, we called those expansion packs), purely cosmetic changes that don't affect the game (so buying them is just for bragging rights / supporting the creator), or ask for donations in appreciation for the work you've already put out there.\n\n* Extra: internal narrative consistency.

There are many games that already fit that mold (gain levels, earn loot, repeat), I&amp;#39;d recommend heading over to &lt;a href=\"https://plaza.dsolver.ca/games?keyword=rpg\"&gt;the Plaza&lt;/a&gt; and giving them a quick glance over to see what they do very well and what they do frustratingly poorly. Or, just pick up any mainstream RPG and skip through the plot segments, which is where the genre sorta started out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) The UI is very important for this genre. There have been flame wars over tabbed / multipage interfaces versus modal / popout interfaces versus all-in-one / scrolling interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It comes down to personal preference (I&amp;#39;m a fan of tabbed interfaces, so I&amp;#39;ll use that in my examples below), but the biggest things everyone mostly agrees on is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;relevant elements should be together: we shouldn&amp;#39;t have to navigate through a maze of different tabs to use related elements of the game. If I gain experience on one screen, use that experience to level up on a second, use those levels to assign skill points on a third, also use those levels to pick skills on a fourth, and so forth, it&amp;#39;s not good design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;design around relative scalability / be considerate of the variety of devices people play games on. This isn&amp;#39;t to say every game must have a different design for mobile, web, and desktop deployment, but rather: if I click to play a game and the first thing I have to do is zoom out to 25% to get everything to fit on one screen, and there isn&amp;#39;t a good reason why there are sixty fixed rows of upgrades that are required to be side by side instead of grouping them together dynamically based on my resolution, then I&amp;#39;ll nope out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, this &amp;quot;consider the audience&amp;quot; mindset for design has been around forever, there&amp;#39;s no reason why modern devs continue to ignore it. I remember reading articles on how to design web pages and applications for difference environments back in the late 80s. Back before we even HAD options or tools to mitigate it, and it was an actual chore that required you to jury-rig complicated hacks together to figure out how to get your program to show up the same on a Commodore as it would on a Sinclair. Not a few lines in your CSS that you copied and pasted from a snippet reservoir. (UPHILL BOTH WAYS.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clean and contrasting. This isn&amp;#39;t Myspace. All elements of the UI should mesh together well. Dark backgrounds, light foregrounds. Vice versa for dark mode. Crisp fonts, readability, all that. That means: no Comic Sans lime text on magenta backgrounds. On the subject of fonts, for many games that involve numbers going up and changing rapidly: fixed width is a must for those numbers. Think digital clocks. It may seem unimportant that 1 is thinner than 5 in most fonts, but when those numbers are changing rapidly every second, it goes from being easily readable at a glance to being a hell of bouncing, jiggling numbers that give you a headache.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Same thing with decimal places: It hurts the eyes and boggles the brain to go from 4.99 to 15.996 to 123.0 to 1009936.5 to 100826, etc. Limit to significant numbers (typically hundredths or thousandths place, and magnitudes of a thousand) to make it easier on us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) (in order of presentation)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebirth / prestige is not strictly necessary, but in games of this nature, yes, we&amp;#39;re used to the idea of looping the content over and over again to make bigger gains to push past further walls to loop the content again to make bigger gains... again, not strictly necessary, and there&amp;#39;s a fair argument to be made that the concept is overdone, but it IS a staple. It tends to work best when the rebirth mechanic is tied to a significant growth element in the game (so say if you have leveling up units as something you can do during a run, then ranking up those units to a higher tier is something you might to offset the pain of restarting from level zero) or mechanics unfold as a direct result of prestiging past milestones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gacha. Be careful with that. Some people love loot boxes, other people hate them with a passion. Some people think of it as a fun mechanic that adds the thrill of randomness and 100% completion challenges, others consider it a gambling mechanic that abuses Skinner&amp;#39;s Box principles to &amp;quot;reward&amp;quot; player&amp;#39;s developing an addiction. ESPECIALLY in this genre, which is essentially &amp;quot;distilled dopamine on demand&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s a controversial addition. ESPECIALLY if you add any kind of IAP / pay2progress feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFK progress. People love the idea of not wasting their time, but honestly, offline progress has never truly been implemented well. Either the values go up too much too quickly from active play to make passive gains worth anything, or you are &amp;quot;choice-gated&amp;quot; behind decisions that you cannot make while offline, ergo you hit that wall and then all your afk progress from there on becomes pointless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people prefer &amp;quot;offline time&amp;quot; systems for that reason. For every X minutes we&amp;#39;re offline, give us Y minutes of toggleable double gamespeed time. That way we can &amp;quot;catch up&amp;quot; meaningfully, but still experience the sense of progress and achievement for clearing certain hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IAP. &amp;quot;Competitive advantage without being a Paywall&amp;quot; is an oxymoron. All IAPs that affect the game itself are pay2win elements. No exceptions. What&amp;#39;s worse is, devs think that by restricting cheating in their games, they can then charge money for cheats they provide, and that is ethical. I&amp;#39;ve ranted about this before, but to keep it concise: if ten seconds in Cheat Engine can get me what you expect $5 for, then you&amp;#39;re telling me that your &lt;strong&gt;intentionally induced artificial scarcity&lt;/strong&gt; is worth a heapload of real money. (Not the game itself, which is free -- the motte / bailey that so many devs hide behind.) That that &lt;em&gt;ten seconds&lt;/em&gt; of my time saved (often by restricting me from investing that time) is realistically worth, oh, ~$1,800 an hour. And yes, suckers fall for it all the time. Doesn&amp;#39;t make it ethical.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to introduce IAP, then put simply: &lt;em&gt;do the work&lt;/em&gt;. Either admit up front that your game costs money to play (and slap a price sticker on the box), have exciting new mechanics and elements that are purchased-only (back in the day, we called those expansion packs), purely cosmetic changes that don&amp;#39;t affect the game (so buying them is just for bragging rights / supporting the creator), or ask for donations in appreciation for the work you&amp;#39;ve already put out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Extra: internal narrative consistency.

Both of his attacks go off less than a second after my big attack does, even with 7000 points in cooldown reduction.\n\nBest I can figure is, cooldown reduction is a flat rate in milliseconds --- which means that at I'm getting a -0.70 second buff, or a 28% speed increase to my regular attack and a 7% speed increase to my power attack, which is very underwhelming for \"endgame buffs\" we've been grinding for. I mean, I can't even one shot the weakest wiggly worm at max strength, and he always gets an attack in before I finish him off even at almost max speed. Hardly feels like I've become stronger, just that I've kept up with the curve and barely finished off the enemies I faced (especially true revisiting area two enemies, which can still kill me in automatic mode even with maxed stats, since my recovery doesn't keep up with their damage over multiple fights.)\n\nNow for the ideas.\n\nThe game needs to make you feel like each page you traverse, you become far more powerful than you were at the start. This would require more enemies (for more choice) and more rows (for more difficulty) per page, with each page split up into tiers of enemies.\n\nRow one enemies are the grindbait, designed to serve a small challenge when you first start on that page, but also for idling against once you've beaten a few and gotten strong enough to not focus on actively fighting them. Basic buffs that additively increase your power until you reach the threshold to take on row two.\n\nAbout halfway through the row one enemies, you should be able to take on row two enemies if you're actively monitoring your fights, or passively if you've grinded out all the row one enemies and defeated all the enemies on the earlier page. These unlock the \"specials\" of that page, better buffs with more variance that make finishing up the earlier enemies trivial.\n\nRow three should be your sub-boss enemies, which award buffs that improve upon earlier boss rewards, and are limited in supply similar to bosses (5-10 kills each). Unless you're returning from a later page to clean up, they should always be active fights where you have to consider when to use abilities and spells that are timed.\n\nOn the right, the boss. Same as currently, requires you to have mostly cleared out this page and the pages before, sometimes it might help to clear row one enemies on the next page before facing the boss of the current page. Instead of needing to grind them multiple times (the first one to prove we can do it makes all the rest trivial), just ONE tough fight with a new mechanic reward (such as self healing in combat, critical chance, spells or new attacks, etc.) that changes up the game. Automatically trivializes most earlier pages, once you clear for example the page 4 boss the page 3 enemies should be idlebait now.\n\nFurthermore, there should be more enemies on each row (I'd suggest four per row, each one following traditional \"warrior / rogue / cleric / mage\" archetypes), so that you can choose how to progress, whether its grinding out health, strength, intellect, or whatever. Gives you a feeling of growing strength and making meaningful choices, while also making it not strictly necessary to return to an earlier page to clean up in order to progress -- although the cumulative bonuses of an earlier page should still be meaningful enough that you might idle it just for a small advantage against current enemies you just barely can't beat. If your pure strength hero oneshots most enemies, but folds like paper to faster enemies, might be beneficial to go back a page and grind up some attack speed or health.\n\nI'd suggest four fodder enemies on the top row, which awards small flat bonuses to base stats. The \"warrior\" enemy which gives good strength and low health and attack speed, the \"rogue\" enemy which gives good attack speed and low rest and strength, the \"cleric\" enemy that grants decent health and low rest and int, and the \"mage\" enemy that gives decent intelligence and low attack speed and rest. Nothing special like armor or combat regen, just the basics. Scaled around the page, so for example the Shroom on page 3 might give 3 int, 1 attack speed, or 1 rest recovery per defeat, while the Turtle on page 5 might give 5 health, 2 rest recovery, or 2 intellect.\n\nMiddle row are the \"champions\" where the archetypes are more meaningful and themed around earlier unlocks, like the \"warrior\" type giving crit chance, the \"rogue\" type giving double attack, the \"cleric\" type giving armor, and the \"mage\" type giving shielding.\n\nSubbosses would each be a blending of two archetypes, to make dealing with them tricky and refreshing. A warrior / cleric mix that has ridiculous health, hits like a truck, but is very slow and doesn't recover over the fight, making it a battle of attrition and outliving their big hits to get rewarded with a huge buff to strength or health, or a warrior / rogue type that chainsaws through you with high damage high speed attacks, but has low enough health that one sufficiently powerful attack is enough to take them down if you can last that long and seize their huge attack speed or strength buff from them.\n\nAs mentioned above, defeating these should feel meaningful the first time you pull it off, and still slightly tricky when you return from a later page to grind out their other rewards. Those rewards should improve upon recently established boss rewards (e.g. once you have the +20% dodge chance from the first rogue boss, the two rogue-flavored subbosses on the next page should give +1% dodge chance five times, up to 30%.)\n\nBosses should pick an archetype (or multiple at later pages) and be the best example, with a reward to match. Examples:\n\nFirst boss: a pure \"warrior\" that has incredible strength and decent health and attack speed, that drops the \"power strike\" attack.\n\nFifth boss, a \"warrior / rogue\" hybrid that hits hard and fast, soaks a little damage and recovers fairly well, and rewards the \"counter\" stat (which later subbosses and champions will improve upon).\n\nNinth boss, a \"warrior / rogue / cleric\" hybrid that only has the weakness of poor recovery, but hits hard and fast and with ridiculous health to back it up and grants the \"leech\" stat.\n\nThirteenth boss, a \"warrior / rogue / cleric / mage\" hybrid that requires all the skills you've unlocked this far to even stand a chance, and gives the \"resurrection\" skill, which has a very long cooldown spanning multiple fights but will bring you back from the dead once after casting, to make grinding out the earlier areas less risky.\n\nFourteenth plus bosses, back to the start (warrior / rogue / cleric / mage / warrior rogue / warrior cleric etc.) but with insane stats that require you to \"dip ahead\" for the right stats to win (the fourteenth \"warrior\" boss WILL one shot you, even if you come back from several pages ahead with all the health you could grind out, so you need to be fast and lethal enough to beat him before he gets that attack off.) No new rewards (since this would be post-endgame neverending content), just improvements on the existing rewards.\n\nJust my thoughts. Game is fun and kept me hooked for about an hour, but pacing and balance are going to be necessary going forward. Right now, with just two pages of enemies, the \"grind to completion to hit the next enemy\" formula works, but expecting 100% completion to move on to another area will quickly get aggravating as you expand to add more content.", "edited": 1663558823.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some ideas and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attack cooldown seem a little off / underwhelming - I have 2.5 and 10 seconds on my strikes, versus the boss who has 10 and 15 seconds on his attacks.

You know the one, you got home after a day of having fun, said I love you to your girlfriend, told her you really liked the shirt she was wearing, and five minutes later when you walk back in the living room she's on the phone crying and sputtering out \"I don't know WHAT I did to set him off, but he came home and immediately started yelling!\" and you have to remember *what* you said, in precisely what *tone*, and figure out *how* she interpreted \"I love you\" as \"I hate you.\"\n\nNow remember that time you came home and after tapping in the security alarm code, and right when you hit the last digit a diamond popped into existence on your kitchen counter. You immediately had a dozen questions: what just happened, how did it happen, can I make it happen again, is this legal, did I break reality, is there a hardcap on how many diamonds I can create per second?\n\nThe first one is what happens when you are lazy with communication. You cannot expect your players to be mind readers who know exactly what you intend or else they shant have any fun, any more than your girlfriend can expect you to understand wordlessly without asking that her stepdad used to beat her with a belt while saying \"I love you\" in exactly that tone and years of conditioned trauma leads her to break down when you express adoration of her like that. You are NOT the bad guy for being confused and wanting to know PRECISELY what the eff is going on here, and neither are the players.\n\nIn the second case, you discovered a fun and exciting new possibility, and you, like any reasonable person would, IMMEDIATELY had a hundred questions about how to optimize this experience within the framework and rules you'd discovered so far. THAT is what your players deserve. Not this \"some gold\" and \"a little gold\" crap, but hard numbers so we can figure out how to push for grandmother's love, how to best use our time, and whether we need to swap from Politics to Odd Jobs now to make the next advancement, or if my napkin math indicates I should be hunting for a few years before swinging hard into Leatherworking.\n\nIt all comes back to communication. I've seen plenty of Spreadsheety Games that showed promise, but the dev didn't feel like it needed explaining what exactly Quoofs were and why they sometimes made your Beiongas go up and then sometimes instead caused a Hiuble to happen (which isn't explained in game but according to Discord is REALLY bad and you may as well hard reset now), and all of those stubborn \"play it the way I intended but don't ask how I intended it\" games ended up being little niche web toys that a very tiny number of people were diehard fans of -- and everyone else hated.\n\nSee also: Sandcastle Builder. According to the five people who've actually read every single comic strip and intuitively understand the creator's mindset, it's the best game ever made. According to *literally* everyone else, \"I played for ten minutes and gave up, wth is this?\"\n\nI'd hate to see a strong entry in the looping genre (which is scant to begin with) die out because of that \"I don't want to ruin the fun by explaining fundamental concepts players need to know to have fun\" mindset. Like, for example, uh... how much money \"a little\" really is. I mean, if you think that's agreeable, I'd love to have you come over to my house and do some work, like replacing the carpets and repainting the walls. I'll definitely pay you (afterwards) \"an amount of money.\" Up to my spending limit, of course, which is \"more than my spending limit.\" That's fair, right? More than reasonable, right? I explained that well enough that you shouldn't have any more questions, right?

You know the one, you got home after a day of having fun, said I love you to your girlfriend, told her you really liked the shirt she was wearing, and five minutes later when you walk back in the living room she&amp;#39;s on the phone crying and sputtering out &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know WHAT I did to set him off, but he came home and immediately started yelling!&amp;quot; and you have to remember &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you said, in precisely what &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;, and figure out &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; she interpreted &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;I hate you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now remember that time you came home and after tapping in the security alarm code, and right when you hit the last digit a diamond popped into existence on your kitchen counter. You immediately had a dozen questions: what just happened, how did it happen, can I make it happen again, is this legal, did I break reality, is there a hardcap on how many diamonds I can create per second?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first one is what happens when you are lazy with communication. You cannot expect your players to be mind readers who know exactly what you intend or else they shant have any fun, any more than your girlfriend can expect you to understand wordlessly without asking that her stepdad used to beat her with a belt while saying &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; in exactly that tone and years of conditioned trauma leads her to break down when you express adoration of her like that. You are NOT the bad guy for being confused and wanting to know PRECISELY what the eff is going on here, and neither are the players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the second case, you discovered a fun and exciting new possibility, and you, like any reasonable person would, IMMEDIATELY had a hundred questions about how to optimize this experience within the framework and rules you&amp;#39;d discovered so far. THAT is what your players deserve. Not this &amp;quot;some gold&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a little gold&amp;quot; crap, but hard numbers so we can figure out how to push for grandmother&amp;#39;s love, how to best use our time, and whether we need to swap from Politics to Odd Jobs now to make the next advancement, or if my napkin math indicates I should be hunting for a few years before swinging hard into Leatherworking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to communication. I&amp;#39;ve seen plenty of Spreadsheety Games that showed promise, but the dev didn&amp;#39;t feel like it needed explaining what exactly Quoofs were and why they sometimes made your Beiongas go up and then sometimes instead caused a Hiuble to happen (which isn&amp;#39;t explained in game but according to Discord is REALLY bad and you may as well hard reset now), and all of those stubborn &amp;quot;play it the way I intended but don&amp;#39;t ask how I intended it&amp;quot; games ended up being little niche web toys that a very tiny number of people were diehard fans of -- and everyone else hated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See also: Sandcastle Builder. According to the five people who&amp;#39;ve actually read every single comic strip and intuitively understand the creator&amp;#39;s mindset, it&amp;#39;s the best game ever made. According to &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; everyone else, &amp;quot;I played for ten minutes and gave up, wth is this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d hate to see a strong entry in the looping genre (which is scant to begin with) die out because of that &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to ruin the fun by explaining fundamental concepts players need to know to have fun&amp;quot; mindset. Like, for example, uh... how much money &amp;quot;a little&amp;quot; really is. I mean, if you think that&amp;#39;s agreeable, I&amp;#39;d love to have you come over to my house and do some work, like replacing the carpets and repainting the walls. I&amp;#39;ll definitely pay you (afterwards) &amp;quot;an amount of money.&amp;quot; Up to my spending limit, of course, which is &amp;quot;more than my spending limit.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s fair, right? More than reasonable, right? I explained that well enough that you shouldn&amp;#39;t have any more questions, right? And besides, finding out what exactly you just spent two weeks earning is part of the fun, right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As another example, and yes I know other games do this as well, but this idea of &amp;quot;hidden achievements&amp;quot; is silly on the face of it -- an achievement is a difficult goal you set your sights on and work hard to reach, not something random and arbitrary you stumble upon by accident.
