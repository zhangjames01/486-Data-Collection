'porno chic', i.e. the first time in US history when the average person might see (or at least read about) a porn film playing in normal theaters. The late show hosts on TV talked about it, the newspapers and magazines reviewed it, and suddenly the average person was aware that not only was oral sex a thing, but there was even an extreme version of it. (When the filmmakers who made 'Deep Throat' were introduced to the actress by her boyfriend, they were like \"she can do *what*? She's done this to *you*?\" Even porn producers learned a thing or two from this movie.)\n\nWhen the book (2011) and film (2015) of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' became popular, there was a huge upswing in interest in domination/submission relationships... this too became something people could talk about openly, because it was being discussed on TV and in newspapers and magazines.\n\nThe US might just be a weird combination of Puritanism and perversion, but this pattern keeps repeating. 11 US states still have laws against sodomy, about half of them including oral sex in that class. Another three have laws that only make it illegal for same-sex couples... they don't need laws against sodomy for male-female couples, because (their story goes) nobody in their states does such things. Which doesn't mean that people aren't actually doing these things, but still... Puritanism. Utah, one of the states with the weirdest and most pervasive religions, only downgraded their laws against sodomy and oral sex in 2019... now it is only illegal when forced or when involving children. And having grown up there, I can tell you that people there have sex with their clothes on, and the church frowns on sex for any purpose other than conceiving babies, which justifies its stance on various forms of sodomy as types of sex that can't lead to conceiving babies.\n\n(This isn't just in the US. Queen Elizabeth signed into law a ban on male homosexual relationships. When asked to do the same for female homosexual relationships, she said they didn't *need* a law against that because nobody was doing that.)\n\nGiven that it's only been the past couple of centuries that people started bathing regularly (something not done in some places because you might catch a 'miasma' and get sick or die, but in places like the US also because the Puritans considered bathing to be immoral, something you would do once a month or so, with your underclothes on); less than two centuries since people started believing in germs; slightly over a century since antibiotics were discovered; and less than a century since penicillin (which cures poxy venereal diseases like syphilis, which was extremely widespread right up into the 1960s) was discovered, I suspect oral sex wasn't as prevalent in the past.\n\nAlso, it has been widely documented that sexual behaviors in the US changed profoundly during and after the Vietnam War, when soldiers were coming back from places like Bangkok having learned a few things - and caught a few things - in the brothels. Army doctors kept penicillin on hand to treat men who came back from 'R-and-R' with syphilis, and the soldiers who have written about their experiences in the Vietnam War all say that pretty much *everyone* caught syphilis or gonorrhea.\n\nBut it is natural for anyone, at any point in history, to think that things must have always been the way they are now.", "edited": 1648068685.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US and Canada, into the 1960s many adults thought of oral sex as something people did in France.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 1972 film &amp;#39;Deep Throat&amp;#39; ushered in the era of &amp;#39;porno chic&amp;#39;, i.e. the first time in US history when the average person might see (or at least read about) a porn film playing in normal theaters.

Which doesn&amp;#39;t mean that people aren&amp;#39;t actually doing these things, but still... Puritanism. Utah, one of the states with the weirdest and most pervasive religions, only downgraded their laws against sodomy and oral sex in 2019... now it is only illegal when forced or when involving children. And having grown up there, I can tell you that people there have sex with their clothes on, and the church frowns on sex for any purpose other than conceiving babies, which justifies its stance on various forms of sodomy as types of sex that can&amp;#39;t lead to conceiving babies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(This isn&amp;#39;t just in the US. Queen Elizabeth signed into law a ban on male homosexual relationships. When asked to do the same for female homosexual relationships, she said they didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a law against that because nobody was doing that.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given that it&amp;#39;s only been the past couple of centuries that people started bathing regularly (something not done in some places because you might catch a &amp;#39;miasma&amp;#39; and get sick or die, but in places like the US also because the Puritans considered bathing to be immoral, something you would do once a month or so, with your underclothes on); less than two centuries since people started believing in germs; slightly over a century since antibiotics were discovered; and less than a century since penicillin (which cures poxy venereal diseases like syphilis, which was extremely widespread right up into the 1960s) was discovered, I suspect oral sex wasn&amp;#39;t as prevalent in the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, it has been widely documented that sexual behaviors in the US changed profoundly during and after the Vietnam War, when soldiers were coming back from places like Bangkok having learned a few things - and caught a few things - in the brothels. Army doctors kept penicillin on hand to treat men who came back from &amp;#39;R-and-R&amp;#39; with syphilis, and the soldiers who have written about their experiences in the Vietnam War all say that pretty much &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; caught syphilis or gonorrhea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is natural for anyone, at any point in history, to think that things must have always been the way they are now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_tkx3f8", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/tkx3f8/what_is_the_appeal_for_men_to_cum_on_our_faces/i1tywk4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tkx3f8/what_is_the_appeal_for_men_to_cum_on_our_faces/", "name": "t1_i1tywk4", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1648062119.0, "created_utc": 1648062119.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tkx3f8/what_is_the_appeal_for_men_to_cum_on_our_faces/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sumo", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Hamiltonian generates time translation", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskPhysics", "link_author": "Welcome_Green", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i1tl3w8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BennyPendentes", "num_comments": 16, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i1s4yxw", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4jeux", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks, this was well-explained.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, this was well-explained.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_tkrgmo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskPhysics/comments/tkrgmo/hamiltonian_generates_time_translation/i1tl3w8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/tkrgmo/hamiltonian_generates_time_translation/", "name": "t1_i1tl3w8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskPhysics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1648056900.0, "created_utc": 1648056900.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/tkrgmo/hamiltonian_generates_time_translation/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "what is the appeal for men to cum on our faces?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "donutambassador", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i1tiiz2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BennyPendentes", "num_comments": 293, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_tkx3f8", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_4jeux", "over_18": true, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "For every person (of whatever gender) who likes this, there are likely significantly more for whom there is no appeal.
