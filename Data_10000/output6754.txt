Here is what I learned in the process since I was doing it by myself and researching as I went. \n\n1- Time. It takes 45-60 days to close on a home AFTER having an accepted offer. If your lease ends on April 1, you will need to have an accepted offer by the middle to end of January/early February to be able to move out in time without having to extend your lease. I naively assumed that it would be much faster as long as I had my financing secured. I was wrong and had to extend my lease by 2 months which cost me about $700 extra to pay the month-to-month premium at my apartment. \n\n2- Preapprovals. These help speed up the sale/closing process slightly, so definitely get your offers as soon as you start house shopping. There is a certain window of time (maybe 2 weeks?) where if you get quotes from multiple banks/lenders, it only counts as one hard pull on your credit report. Get as many as you can right from the start to prevent having your credit dinged multiple times in a short period of time which could lead to an eventual denial from your lender if your score drops too much. \n\n3- Credit Unions. I got preapproval through 5-6 different companies, and my local credit union gave me the lowest interest rate (by about .75% at the time) as well as the lowest closings costs. And it wasn\u2019t even close. My credit union\u2019s cost was about $2700 where Rocket Mortgage quoted me at $6500. The market has changed recently with the low interest rates, but definitely get a quote from 1-2 credit unions. Also, I pay $22/month for PMI from my credit union (15% down payment) and the bigger banks were between $120-$150/month for PMI. \n\n4- Costs. Buying a home is expensive. I purchased a home for about $170k and had about $38k saved in the bank for a down payment. I was really trying to hit 20% down payment, but in a sellers market, all of the closing costs fell to me. I ended up having to drop to 15% to ensure I had enough cash to pay for inspections/moving costs and still have a safety net in the bank. I would say you need a bare minimum of 10% of the purchase price in liquid assets (cash in the bank) to be covered. That would only let you make about a 3.5% down payment and still have enough for the other expenses/closing costs. Based on your $225k budget, I\u2019d recommend you have at least $25k in the bank to make sure you have enough for all of the closing costs, and then put the rest as a down payment. Having around $50k would be ideal and may be just enough for a 20% down payment as well as covering closing costs. Just a ball park figure from someone who isn\u2019t a specialist, though, so take that with a grain of salt. \n\nHopefully this helps a bit!

There is a certain window of time (maybe 2 weeks?) where if you get quotes from multiple banks/lenders, it only counts as one hard pull on your credit report. Get as many as you can right from the start to prevent having your credit dinged multiple times in a short period of time which could lead to an eventual denial from your lender if your score drops too much. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3- Credit Unions. I got preapproval through 5-6 different companies, and my local credit union gave me the lowest interest rate (by about .75% at the time) as well as the lowest closings costs. And it wasn\u2019t even close. My credit union\u2019s cost was about $2700 where Rocket Mortgage quoted me at $6500. The market has changed recently with the low interest rates, but definitely get a quote from 1-2 credit unions. Also, I pay $22/month for PMI from my credit union (15% down payment) and the bigger banks were between $120-$150/month for PMI. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4- Costs. Buying a home is expensive. I purchased a home for about $170k and had about $38k saved in the bank for a down payment. I was really trying to hit 20% down payment, but in a sellers market, all of the closing costs fell to me. I ended up having to drop to 15% to ensure I had enough cash to pay for inspections/moving costs and still have a safety net in the bank. I would say you need a bare minimum of 10% of the purchase price in liquid assets (cash in the bank) to be covered. That would only let you make about a 3.5% down payment and still have enough for the other expenses/closing costs. Based on your $225k budget, I\u2019d recommend you have at least $25k in the bank to make sure you have enough for all of the closing costs, and then put the rest as a down payment. Having around $50k would be ideal and may be just enough for a 20% down payment as well as covering closing costs. Just a ball park figure from someone who isn\u2019t a specialist, though, so take that with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps a bit! Knowing these ahead of time would have made my home purchase process a bit easier, I think. Just wanted to pay it forward to someone else in a similar situation!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_io8npw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/personalfinance/comments/io8npw/advice_on_looking_to_purchase_a_home_for/g4ce7po/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/io8npw/advice_on_looking_to_purchase_a_home_for/", "name": "t1_g4ce7po", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1599494324.0, "created_utc": 1599494324.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/io8npw/advice_on_looking_to_purchase_a_home_for/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Should I pay off my car?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "personalfinance", "link_author": "MillenialSuffering", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "g4ca8dz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "aye_ofthetiger", "num_comments": 24, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_g4c8cgh", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_hjy4c", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Based on this, no I would definitely not empty your emergency fund to pay off a low interest debt. 2.9% is about equal to the average inflation rate, so there isn\u2019t a huge benefit to paying it off early. \n\nWith your interest payment being about $36/month and having 36-37 payments left, you would only save $1350ish in interest if you paid it off now versus over the life of the loan.
