https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/585905748267245569\n\n&gt; The point of origin of a cubic area of effect, including thunderwave's, is on a face of the cube (PH, pg 204), not inside it.\n\nHowever, note that all he says is\n\n1) The *point of origin* is on the *face* of a cube  \n2) The *point of origin* is not on the interior of the cube\n\nHe does not state that the cube must be oriented in a certain way in relation to its caster and origin.\n\nLet's also add in the relevant PHB entry on Cubic spells\n\n&gt; You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.  \nA cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\n\nSo, despite the image on that page suggesting it's the center of a face, the origin point for a cubic spell actually lies ANYWHERE on ANY of a cube's 6 faces. This means that the point of origin for the cube can actually lie along ANY point on the cube, as each face meets at edges and corners. You could be standing at 0,0 and have the origin of the cube be at the vertex where 0,0 meets 1,1, and orient the cube in any direction in space you want. \n\nNow let's look at the thunderwave spell.\n\n&gt; Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw.\n\nSo we have these facts\n\n1) The cube is 15 feet wide.  \n2) You are the origin.\n\nYou are not a point though. You are a form with height, width, volume, and area. Any point of YOU is a part of YOU. And since you are the origin, any point on you may be that point of origin.\n\nThe bottom of your left heel may be that point of origin, with the cube containing yourself. That origin point could lie on the center of a cube's face, or on a corner that extends the cube to your left.\n\nBut a technical note is that if you contain yourself within the cube of Thunderwave, you must also make the saving throw and suffer the relevant effects. A cube's point of origin isn't included in the cube's area of effect (unless you decide otherwise), but if that point is from your knee extending upwards, your knee's out of the way, but everything above you isn't.\n\nAll of this is Rules as Written.\n\nSo both conceptions of how cubes work is correct.

It should be to give yourself the reward of being an improved you. Sure, getting better responses from others in terms of friendships, relationships, etc. can be a part of the goal, but if it's the sole driving force, you'll work on all the wrong things and set yourself up for disappointment when you don't see the results you thought they would get you.\n\nThe best way to get other people to like you is to improve parts of yourself that make you like yourself more. Even I have an issue with self-loathing, but I constantly try to become a better person to those around me, because helping people have a good time, or feel safer, or generally just have an improved life makes me feel like I like myself, and that ends up coming out in many people liking me too.\n\nI subscribe to the philosophical concept of consequentialism. The core principal is that the morality of an action is determined solely by its results\u2014by its consequences. Likewise, people are good not through their intentions, but through their actions. Even if your ultimate goal in improving yourself is for some \"greedy\" reason as some might call it, as long as your path toward that goal results in good things for people, then those things you have done in that process were good things.\n\nSo do this favor for me. As you try to improve yourself, don't skimp on doing good things that make you feel better about yourself. Help others when they struggle. Console them when they're hurt. Laugh with them when they're happy. It'll be difficult at first. But over time you'll get used to it. It'll become part of your routine. Because the first step to becoming a better person is acting like a better person. Faking it until you're making it.\n\nEven if you always keep a dark core of self-loathing, or a small twinge of alienation, you'll be a person who shows the world that he loves himself, and it will make you look open for people to find something about you that interests them.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I think seeing hard work and self improvement pretty much go to waste in that regard&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that the issue here is actually a problem of either perspective, or expectation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sole driver of self improvement should not be to have others reward you. It should be to give yourself the reward of being an improved you. Sure, getting better responses from others in terms of friendships, relationships, etc. can be a part of the goal, but if it&amp;#39;s the sole driving force, you&amp;#39;ll work on all the wrong things and set yourself up for disappointment when you don&amp;#39;t see the results you thought they would get you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to get other people to like you is to improve parts of yourself that make you like yourself more. Even I have an issue with self-loathing, but I constantly try to become a better person to those around me, because helping people have a good time, or feel safer, or generally just have an improved life makes me feel like I like myself, and that ends up coming out in many people liking me too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to the philosophical concept of consequentialism. The core principal is that the morality of an action is determined solely by its results\u2014by its consequences. Likewise, people are good not through their intentions, but through their actions. Even if your ultimate goal in improving yourself is for some &amp;quot;greedy&amp;quot; reason as some might call it, as long as your path toward that goal results in good things for people, then those things you have done in that process were good things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do this favor for me. As you try to improve yourself, don&amp;#39;t skimp on doing good things that make you feel better about yourself. Help others when they struggle. Console them when they&amp;#39;re hurt. Laugh with them when they&amp;#39;re happy. It&amp;#39;ll be difficult at first. But over time you&amp;#39;ll get used to it. It&amp;#39;ll become part of your routine. Because the first step to becoming a better person is acting like a better person.
