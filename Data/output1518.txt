I just wanted to share my own little story in case you feel like it speaks to you in any sort of way.\n\nI was diagnosed with PCOS about a year ago after I had been struggling with my weight through most of my twenties, before which I was pretty thin (27 now).  When I was first diagnosed, I weighed about 240 lbs at 5\u20195\u201d and was a size 18. My doctor put me on metformin and said that it was really important I try to lose some weight but to also keep in mind that it might be tougher than it had in the past.\n\nI tried a few things but I was only losing a tiny bit of weight until I did two round of whole 30 in January and March of 2019.  I lost 30 lbs in two months!  It was great, I was in a size 14 and I felt like I had a better relationship with food.  I even started to build in a fitness routine and I now \u201cwork out\u201d everyday for 30 minutes.  This means lifting 4 days a week and doing some form of cardio the other three days.  Similar to you, I am also a teacher but finishing my credential program so I am on my feet all day (I basically work 14 hour days).\n\nSo here I am a year later and even though the quality of food I eat is way better and I regularly exercise.... I\u2019m still a size 12 at 215 lbs.\n\nI vented to my doctor about this because at this moment, I don\u2019t have the time or energy to do something intense like whole30 again and even with all of my training, I still have this soft stomach pooch.  Like, I\u2019m trying my best at this moment, but wtf.  My doctor said I had been doing a really good of taking care of my body and I had obviously lost a lot of fat even if the scale hadn\u2019t changed a ton.  She also said that not to discourage me.... but I may never be \u201cskinny\u201d again; that health is holistic and if I was doing everything I was telling her (I am), then maybe that\u2019s good enough.  \n\nYes, if we push our bodies hard enough we will lose the weight, but knowing how much I work (and it sounds like a similar schedule to yours), I\u2019m just going to do the best with what I can for now.  I also talked to my therapist about it and there\u2019s this whole \u201cspoon\u201d theory that is basically like, one spoon represents how much energy you have to give towards your life on any given day, and when you\u2019re out of spoons, you\u2019re done.  So say I had like eight spoons.  Right now six of them are being eaten up by work and school and the one goes towards my fitness and the last one goes towards socializing.  When I\u2019m done with school in May, I\u2019ll have three more spoons back which I would like to dedicate more to food prepping and learning more about food.  But for now, this is good enough.\n\nThis is really just a long winded way of saying be kind to yourself.  You are already doing a lot work to benefit yourself health wise and maybe, that\u2019s good enough for right now .
