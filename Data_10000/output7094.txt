When you watch the GS, you can see how quickly the racers have to basically throw their legs to the other side to stay on their desired line down the hill once they finish up a turn. Most young racers will only get experience in SL/GS until around their mid-teens. Once you get to around 16+ at the higher levels, you can tend to see which individuals are stronger at the technical events and which are stronger at the speed events. At the higher levels, athletes tend to specialize in one or other (though some may compete in both categories).\n\n\nAt the Olympic/World Cup level, injuries tend to be the biggest determinant of lifespan in the sport, but not necessarily age. Prior to Svindal's DH win a few days ago, Mario Matt held the record for oldest Olympic alpine winner at 34 y/o in the slalom in Sochi. From what I've seen, body type tends to generally (with plenty of exceptions) be a better determinant than age. The shorter and lighter individuals tend to be better in the technical events, while the heavier and taller individuals tend to be better at speed events. At some point typically in their late 20's or early 30's, the injuries and general physical toll of the sport tend to force athletes into retirement. \n\nYou tend to see the most success around the mid-late 20's when the athletes have the experience to ski their best before the damage starts to take its toll. You'll hear commentators for the Olympics talk about the best \"line\" to ski, which is the path between gates that gets you down the fastest. It takes a lot of experience to overcome the mental pressure and execute the best line. Similarly, that experience helps you excel at recovering from any mistakes you may have and get back on your line. You tend to see the younger skiers get more aggressive before they're capable of effectively recovering from the mistakes that may happen, or simply ski a line that's too aggressive to maintain for the length of the course. On the other end, you can see skiers get nervous and take a line that's too conservative. Both of these factors will result in slower times.\n\nSource: Raced for a number of years and coached for a few", "edited": 1518987930.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how much knowledge you have on ski racing, so I&amp;#39;ll try to give a quick summary first, then give a bit of a breakdown on the age dynamics as I saw them in US.
