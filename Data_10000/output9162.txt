I was in limbo. I was one semester away from graduating college, I was living in a slum (that I created), and I had let myself go totally. I hadn't quite failed out of college, but I was very close. Writing letters to the school close.\n\nPrior to her death, when I wasn't at my mother's house helping to take care of her, I was basically living in squalor. I was directionless, almost totally out of money, and really just unable to right the ship.\n\nMy mother and I had a conversation about four months before she passed away. The conversation started out pretty tame. One of those casual conversations where she talked about the past. We talked about my childhood, moving from state to state while I was still young, and life in general. At some point during the conversation, she became visibly upset.\n\nShe told me, quite frankly really, that she thought she had failed as a mother.  It was such a tragic thing to hear. Not only was she affirming that I was in the bad place, but also that it was partly her fault.\n\nI don't know if I have to tell you folks this, but hearing that was heartbreaking. I tried my best to convince her that she did her best. I told her that my choices and actions were my own, and that she was an incredibly caring and loving person. To this day, I do not know if she believed me, or if she thought I would ever change.\n\nTo tell you I would look for my mother in a crowd of everyone I've ever met is an understatement. I would run to her. I would shout her name through the noise of that crowd. I would run into her arms and hold onto her until they made me leave whatever room we were all held in.\n\nIt's been about ten years since that conversation at my mother's house. So much has changed in my life. I was able to turn my life around *because of her*. I finished school (I even had a minor!), I moved out of that awful place, and I got a full time job which started my career. I even quit smoking, started running, joined a gym, and turned my health around.\n\nI became the man she had hoped I would become.

Writing letters to the school close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to her death, when I wasn&amp;#39;t at my mother&amp;#39;s house helping to take care of her, I was basically living in squalor. I was directionless, almost totally out of money, and really just unable to right the ship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother and I had a conversation about four months before she passed away. The conversation started out pretty tame. One of those casual conversations where she talked about the past. We talked about my childhood, moving from state to state while I was still young, and life in general. At some point during the conversation, she became visibly upset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She told me, quite frankly really, that she thought she had failed as a mother.  It was such a tragic thing to hear. Not only was she affirming that I was in the bad place, but also that it was partly her fault.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I have to tell you folks this, but hearing that was heartbreaking. I tried my best to convince her that she did her best. I told her that my choices and actions were my own, and that she was an incredibly caring and loving person. To this day, I do not know if she believed me, or if she thought I would ever change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To tell you I would look for my mother in a crowd of everyone I&amp;#39;ve ever met is an understatement. I would run to her. I would shout her name through the noise of that crowd. I would run into her arms and hold onto her until they made me leave whatever room we were all held in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been about ten years since that conversation at my mother&amp;#39;s house. So much has changed in my life. I was able to turn my life around &lt;em&gt;because of her&lt;/em&gt;. I finished school (I even had a minor!), I moved out of that awful place, and I got a full time job which started my career. I even quit smoking, started running, joined a gym, and turned my health around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I became the man she had hoped I would become. During high school and college I had a lot of trouble figuring out who I was, and so much trouble gaining the confidence to pursue a life for myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would give &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to tell her that she was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_mdbrqo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/mdbrqo/if_you_were_in_a_room_with_everyone_you_ever_met/gsagy3z/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mdbrqo/if_you_were_in_a_room_with_everyone_you_ever_met/", "name": "t1_gsagy3z", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1616766280.0, "created_utc": 1616766280.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mdbrqo/if_you_were_in_a_room_with_everyone_you_ever_met/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Getting Hacked in 2010, Vyve, ExpressVPN, the Auction House, and being BANNED", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "wow", "link_author": "NaClx", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gmq8o54", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "NaClx", "num_comments": 72, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gmq22jk", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_53s7e", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks.
