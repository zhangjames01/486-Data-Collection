I used to be obese, so I am very aware of the differences of being a hot/ugly girl. \n\nI don't know if the entire article is accurate, but here are a few points that stood out to me:\n\n* \"success with any particular girl \u2014 especially really hot girls \u2014 is more determinant on her willingness and receptiveness to men IN GENERAL than your specific approach or the way you present yourself.\"\n\nHe hit the nail on the head there. Some nights, I'm looking to have fun with friends or I have to work the next day. Other nights, I just want to go and get laid/\"meet someone.\" I think PUA stuff misses the mark on this in general because it assumes that a woman is always open to being approached, and if she isn't, then she always isn't, does that make sense? Well, it's not true. Some nights, Joe Schmo is going to get luckier with me, and it has nothing to do with his approach and everything to do with me.\n\n* \"having to put up over and over again with people approaching you and bringing absolutely nothing interesting or attractive to the table. It gets tedious and frustrating. And it\u2019s nothing personal either.\"\n\nThat is absolutely true. The reason why there's a trope of bitchy hot girls is not because you, random guy, are a worthless, awful human being, but because she's had so many ... losers? come up to her, and she's bracing herself for another one. It's not personal, she's just sick of the same bullshit, and she just assumes you are the same.\n\n* Is what he described accurate to what life is like for you?\n\nThis would be accurate if you were talking about women who constantly were in areas where approaching was considered OK-- like a 24/7 bar. This isn't what life is like for women all of the time because men don't \"run down the street\" to literally chase us. When I'm at Starbucks, even if the barista thinks I'm the hottest thing in the entire world, he's not going to come sit on my lap or whatever because it would clearly be inappropriate. So, the article is inaccurate in the sense that men are not super aggressive all of the time, day in, day out, because they probably don't want some restraining order against them. \n\nHowever, he was accurate in that he walked around knowing that he could get with pretty much any of the girls. I used to be obese and am now hot, and I think I do act or react differently knowing that most men who talk to me/know me would sleep with me if I were open to the idea.\n\n* Anything he completely doesn't take into consideration that changes the experience?\n\nSo, in Thailand, this guy was essentially a 10 in a sea of 1's and 2's. There were way more Thai girls than Western men. That is not going to be true almost anywhere. If you're a female 10/10, there are places like LA, NYC, Miami, Las Vegas where there are other 10's... and 9.9's, 9.8's... you see what I'm saying? Even if you're really attractive, there are other really attractive women around you. That changes things, because if you're a 9 with a crappy personality, the guy in question could just turn around and talk to the really cool 8.5 or whatever. \n\nEssentially, Thai women (from the article) value \"Western\"-ness over most things, and there aren't many Westerners. Guys don't value looks above all things to the point that *in every situation*, the 10/10 is going to beat out the 9, 8 7... /10. It might be more likely to happen, but in my experience, once you're \"hot enough,\" personality matters a lot more. \n\n* Is it true you can just go out and get sex from almost whomever whenever?\n\nWell, yes and no. I could go on Tinder right now or to a bar tonight, and if my goal is to have sex, I know it could happen. That being said, if my goal is to have sex with Specific Guy A, that might not happen for a combination of factors (he has a gf, he's not interested in me, he's out of town)... Also, I'm going to be selective and have sex with the people I want to have sex with, which narrows it down. So: if my goal was to get laid by anyone, I could do it. If my goal is to get laid by someone I am physically and emotionally attracted to (and in this hypothetical situation, I'm not using anyone I already know), then it depends on many factors outside my control.\n\n* How does this affect your view of sex? Does it make it less appealing than it might be for a guy who doesn't have that ability? Does it affect how you filter out who you might be interested in having sex with?\n\nWell, sex is sex, I'm not sure how it affects my views apart from that I know I have standards. I don't think it makes sex less appealing, but it does make bad sex less appealing. I mean, knowing that 99% of the people I know would welcome me into their beds allows me to be more selective.\n\n* If there is constant attention, what is it like dealing with it? Does it feel like harassment every day?\n\nWell because of general etiquette, it's not harassment like what's described in the article, because men don't literally chase women down the street, or even hug women they don't know. I suppose that if that were the case, it would feel like harassment.\n\nIt depends on the day. There are some times/places that I'd rather be invisible and not chat with a random guys, and there are some days where I feel validated. You deal with it the same way that you deal with everything unwanted in life, politely but firmly. \n\n* Lastly, if there is constant attention, how does that affect validation? Does it make it more difficult to feel validated or easier? For example, if you're having a shit day and feel down on yourself, would you ever go out for a night just because you know you can get the validation of having guys pay you attention and effort to try and have sex with you?\n\nWell, the way it affects validation is that I don't feel validated because the homeless guy tells me I'm beautiful or whatever. If I want to be validated, I want to be validated by someone I consider around an equal. \n\nPersonally, I'm a firm *no* on the third question. I realize I am worth more than my looks, so if I'm feeling sad, my reaction is not to turn around and go to a bar and get Joe Schmo to tell me I'm hot. I do something that makes me feel good (and usually isn't related to outward validation for my looks). \n\nOn that note, being validated for my looks doesn't have to be so obvious as a random guy buying me a drink. In terms of being validated solely through looks, I'd rather catch hot and cool Peter from Marketing staring at me 3x during a meeting than some random guy at a bar telling me I'm cute.\n\n* Or does this cheapen the whole thing and make it more difficult to find someone with whom you feel you can genuinely connect with?\n\nNope. Here's the least-secret secret ever: it's a lot easier to \"connect\" with someone when you're attractive, simply because everyone is open to connect with you. The percentage of people I have a genuine connection with remains the same, but now I know that that more of that population is available to me because the number of them that are likely to connect with me is higher, if that makes sense. \n\nSo, it's just as difficult to *find* that person, but once you've \"found\" him, it's easier because he is probably interested too. \n\nEDIT: wow, thanks so much for the gold!!

Here&amp;#39;s the least-secret secret ever: it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to &amp;quot;connect&amp;quot; with someone when you&amp;#39;re attractive, simply because everyone is open to connect with you. The percentage of people I have a genuine connection with remains the same, but now I know that that more of that population is available to me because the number of them that are likely to connect with me is higher, if that makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;#39;s just as difficult to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; that person, but once you&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;found&amp;quot; him, it&amp;#39;s easier because he is probably interested too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: wow, thanks so much for the gold!!
