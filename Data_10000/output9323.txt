It\u2019s time for him to take responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re all here to support everyone that asks for help, but to start disrespecting everyone that responds to you, you lose the respect you\u2019re demanding. We\u2019re not children here. Most of the people here work in the frontline of Search and Rescue or Law Enforcement missions putting their lives on the line for you to start snipping at us. Trust me, we all want good shipmates, but the last thing we need is Mama Coastie unleashing on us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u2019s learning everything about Tricare, housing, and everything about his new life currently in Cape May. Give him a chance to tell you about everything. You coming on here and starting drama is not good for him. You\u2019ve already mentioned basically which unit he is going to. Those units don\u2019t get new recruits daily, so it\u2019s easy for his future shipmates to know who he is. Don\u2019t give him a bad rap before he even graduates! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any further questions, feel free to ask in a calm and respectful manner.
