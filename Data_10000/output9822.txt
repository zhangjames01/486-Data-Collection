This one's going to be impossible to find legally. But it is the omega of Tsui Hark's period martial arts movies (the alpha would be the *Once Upon a Time in China* series, see below). This is a retelling of 1967's ONE ARMED SWORDSMAN (remember that year) and it represented a new direction in action and story-telling that died a dog's death at the HK box office. Fast and furious, it has never been equalled...nor has it ever been released on home video with English subtitles. [But it's great.](https://youtu.be/fs-mGcLe7lk)\n\nDUMPLINGS - one of the most elegant and insidious horror movies of the 20th century, it\u2019s also remarkable for giving international crazy lady, Bai Ling, her best role. All about a woman whose dumplings keep you young (because they're made of dead babies), it's a bitter hellbox of a movie. Fruit Chan directed, William Chang (Wong Kar-wai's regular art director) did art direction, and Chris Doyle (WKW's longtime cinematographer) shot it. Make sure to get the complete version as the Lionsgate version in the US cuts out a really moving coda.\n\n[A SIMPLE LIFE](https://www.yesasia.com/global/a-simple-life-2011-blu-ray-hong-kong-version/1030993188-0-0-0-en/info.html) \\- Ann Hui is one of Hong Kong's most compassionate and humane directors and this film about an elderly woman struggling to die with dignity became a huge hit, which is surprising given how hard-edged and unsentimental it is. Superstar Andy Lau plays real-life producer, Roger Lee, who worked as an accountant for Tsui Hark\u2019s Film Workshop and later for Golden Harvest, which allows Hui to fill the movie with Hong Kong stars and directors playing themselves. Deanie Ip, a pop star who retired in 1988, plays Lau\u2019s *amah* (family maid) whose health takes a rapid decline after she has a stroke and retires. Contemplative, meditative, and quietly dignified, it\u2019s a gem in Ann Hui\u2019s career and an ode to her favorite two subjects: elderly people and Hong Kong street life. And speaking of Andy Lau, he also starred in...\n\n[INFERNAL AFFAIRS](https://www.criterion.com/films/32453-infernal-affairs) \\- which is in the Criterion Collection for a reason. Really fantastic stuff and not at all the action movie you think it's going to be. I recommend watching *Infernal Affairs* 1 and then 2, since the second movie does a lot to undermine the first. You can skip 3, though.\n\n[COMRADES, ALMOST A LOVE STORY](https://www.yesasia.com/global/comrades-almost-a-love-story-1996-blu-ray-remastered-edition-hong/1057608149-0-0-0-en/info.html) \\- the pinnacle of Peter Chan\u2019s UFO company style of glossy middlebrow filmmaking (and I mean that as a compliment), this romance starring Maggie Cheung and Cantopop star Leon Lai as two Mainland immigrants who fall in love in Hong Kong to the tunes of Teresa Teng\u2019s 1980\u2019s hits stands with Derek Yee\u2019s *C\u2019est La Vie, Mon Cheri* (1993) as one of the two landmark Hong Kong romances. In fact, it's a great romance, period, right up there with *Casablanca* and *Notorious* and if you don't think so then you are an inhuman beast who probably hates kittens and has never been held by your mother.\n\n[FULL ALERT](https://www.diabolikdvd.com/product/full-alert-le-eureka-uk-blu-ray-region-b-preorder/) \\- by the time Ringo Lam's last truly great movie rolls its end credits, Hong Kong action flicks are over. Deceptively sophisticated, Lam's 1997 movie was an elegiac farewell to the colony as well as its most famous genre. Beautiful editing, haunting music, perfectly crafted stunt work and deeply lived performances from Jack Gao, Francis Ng and Lau Ching-wan make this a career high for all involved. But more importantly, it was a farewell to the idea of the action movie as entertainment. Lam wants you to know that while some bad guys need to be blown to hell, the cops who chase them lose their souls when they pull the trigger. What's so entertaining about that?\n\n[ELECTION 1 &amp; 2](https://www.diabolikdvd.com/product/election-1-and-2-chameleon-films-australia-blu-ray-all-region-preorder/) \\- Johnnie To (*Throwdown*) made this secret history of Hong Kong, told through a triad election. This is the *Godfather 1 &amp; 2* of Hong Kong movies and while *Election 1* is at times deliberately confusing (trust me, if you know who's doing what at all times then you're a smarter human than me)  the cumulative effect of these movies are emotionally devastating. If you're falling for Johnnie To check out his Mainland movie, *Drug War*, which is the Michael Mann movie Michael Mann never made but so much meaner. And if you think Mainland censorship kept *Drug War* from being \"About\" anything, realize that every actor playing a drug dealer in the movie is from Hong Kong and every actor playing a cop is from Mainland China and everything takes on a new perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything named above is an artsier movie, and I'm not even mentioning some classics that are incredibly hard to find like Fruit Chan's remarkably moving street life portrait, *Little Cheung*, or Tsui Hark's Buddhist monster feature, *Green Snake*, Herman Yau's searing prison drama, *From the Queen to the Chief Executive*, Wai Ka-fai's Choose-Your-Own-Adventure crime film*, Too Many Ways to Be No. 1*, or the animated ode to Hong Kong culture, *My Life as McDull*. Check them out on YouTube in clips!\n\nNow we get into the action movie side of things.\n\n[POLICE STORY](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/1554-police-story-police-story-2) \\- Jackie Chan is the Buster Keaton of Hong Kong, and I mean that in every way. This is the first movie he really controlled, all the way from the action choreography, to the cinematography, to the editing, to his own performance. He made movies before *Police Story* but this thing stands alone as a true masterpiece. It also marks the time when he moved firmly out of the shadow of his Big Brother, Sammo Hung, one of the greatest action filmmakers to walk the planet, and the man who picked up the genre and did the most to innovate action filmmaking after [Lau Kar-leung](https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/kaiju-shakedown-lau-kar-leung/). You can see Jackie and Sammo together with their Little Brother, Yuen Biao, in the jaw-dropping [DRAGONS FOREVER](https://www.diabolikdvd.com/product/uhd-dragons-forever-us-88-films-release-4k-uhd-preorder/), directed by Sammo. And then if you want to see Jackie and Sammo in relation to Lau Kar-leung himself, you can see Sammo take him on in his [PEDICAB D](https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/pedicab-driver)RIVER while Jackie does the same in his [DRUNKEN MASTER 2](https://www.diabolikdvd.com/product/drunken-master-ii-warner-archive-blu-ray/).\n\n[ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA 1 &amp; 2](https://www.criterion.com/films/30712-once-upon-a-time-in-china) \\- again, these are in the Criterion Collection for a reason, but I'm not sure they're great places to start. I love all of these without reservation, especially the first three, but *OUATIC 1* is a bit of a shaggy dog movie (although anyone who isn't moved by the story of Iron Robe Yim is someone I do NOT want to spend time with) and *OUATIC 2* is great but I get it's not for the uninitiated. I recommend Parts 1 &amp; 2, but they are *very* Hong Kong (shots of priests in hiking boots, obvious make-up and wig lines, occasionally shaky effects, broad acting) so take them with a warning on the label.\n\n[BULLET IN THE HEAD](https://www.diabolikdvd.com/product/bullet-in-the-head-novamedia-blu-ray-all-region/) \\- John Woo's masterpiece. If you like that kind of thing. Woo isn't as smart or as cynical as Ringo Lam, his contemporary, and his *Hard Boiled* is much more satisfying plus no one in it is shouting \"My gooooolddddd!\" approximately 50,000 times a minute, but if you want to see a Hong Kong movie about its 1967 (a year when the city was gripped by protest, war with the police, and civil disobedience, plus a bombing campaign) filtered through the Vietnam War, this is the movie. And it's Woo at his Woo-iest, his bleeding heart worn right out on his sleeve and getting everyone all bloody and stuff. If you want to see Sammo Hung do Vietnam, check out [Eastern Condors](https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Eastern-Condors-Blu-ray/299907/#Overview).", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m going to recommend movies that are more artsy than not (I&amp;#39;ve got a taste for Hong Kong trash that I won&amp;#39;t inflict on you), but here&amp;#39;s stuff that I&amp;#39;d recommend and that you can find out there:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE BLADE - I lied. This one&amp;#39;s going to be impossible to find legally. But it is the omega of Tsui Hark&amp;#39;s period martial arts movies (the alpha would be the &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in China&lt;/em&gt; series, see below). This is a retelling of 1967&amp;#39;s ONE ARMED SWORDSMAN (remember that year) and it represented a new direction in action and story-telling that died a dog&amp;#39;s death at the HK box office. Fast and furious, it has never been equalled...nor has it ever been released on home video with English subtitles. &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/fs-mGcLe7lk\"&gt;But it&amp;#39;s great.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DUMPLINGS - one of the most elegant and insidious horror movies of the 20th century, it\u2019s also remarkable for giving international crazy lady, Bai Ling, her best role. All about a woman whose dumplings keep you young (because they&amp;#39;re made of dead babies), it&amp;#39;s a bitter hellbox of a movie. Fruit Chan directed, William Chang (Wong Kar-wai&amp;#39;s regular art director) did art direction, and Chris Doyle (WKW&amp;#39;s longtime cinematographer) shot it. Make sure to get the complete version as the Lionsgate version in the US cuts out a really moving coda.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.yesasia.com/global/a-simple-life-2011-blu-ray-hong-kong-version/1030993188-0-0-0-en/info.html\"&gt;A SIMPLE LIFE&lt;/a&gt; - Ann Hui is one of Hong Kong&amp;#39;s most compassionate and humane directors and this film about an elderly woman struggling to die with dignity became a huge hit, which is surprising given how hard-edged and unsentimental it is. Superstar Andy Lau plays real-life producer, Roger Lee, who worked as an accountant for Tsui Hark\u2019s Film Workshop and later for Golden Harvest, which allows Hui to fill the movie with Hong Kong stars and directors playing themselves. Deanie Ip, a pop star who retired in 1988, plays Lau\u2019s &lt;em&gt;amah&lt;/em&gt; (family maid) whose health takes a rapid decline after she has a stroke and retires. Contemplative, meditative, and quietly dignified, it\u2019s a gem in Ann Hui\u2019s career and an ode to her favorite two subjects: elderly people and Hong Kong street life. And speaking of Andy Lau, he also starred in...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/films/32453-infernal-affairs\"&gt;INFERNAL AFFAIRS&lt;/a&gt; - which is in the Criterion Collection for a reason. Really fantastic stuff and not at all the action movie you think it&amp;#39;s going to be. I recommend watching &lt;em&gt;Infernal Affairs&lt;/em&gt; 1 and then 2, since the second movie does a lot to undermine the first. You can skip 3, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.yesasia.com/global/comrades-almost-a-love-story-1996-blu-ray-remastered-edition-hong/1057608149-0-0-0-en/info.html\"&gt;COMRADES, ALMOST A LOVE STORY&lt;/a&gt; - the pinnacle of Peter Chan\u2019s UFO company style of glossy middlebrow filmmaking (and I mean that as a compliment), this romance starring Maggie Cheung and Cantopop star Leon Lai as two Mainland immigrants who fall in love in Hong Kong to the tunes of Teresa Teng\u2019s 1980\u2019s hits stands with Derek Yee\u2019s &lt;em&gt;C\u2019est La Vie, Mon Cheri&lt;/em&gt; (1993) as one of the two landmark Hong Kong romances. In fact, it&amp;#39;s a great romance, period, right up there with &lt;em&gt;Casablanca&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Notorious&lt;/em&gt; and if you don&amp;#39;t think so then you are an inhuman beast who probably hates kittens and has never been held by your mother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.diabolikdvd.com/product/full-alert-le-eureka-uk-blu-ray-region-b-preorder/\"&gt;FULL ALERT&lt;/a&gt; - by the time Ringo Lam&amp;#39;s last truly great movie rolls its end credits, Hong Kong action flicks are over. Deceptively sophisticated, Lam&amp;#39;s 1997 movie was an elegiac farewell to the colony as well as its most famous genre. Beautiful editing, haunting music, perfectly crafted stunt work and deeply lived performances from Jack Gao, Francis Ng and Lau Ching-wan make this a career high for all involved. But more importantly, it was a farewell to the idea of the action movie as entertainment. Lam wants you to know that while some bad guys need to be blown to hell, the cops who chase them lose their souls when they pull the trigger. What&amp;#39;s so entertaining about that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.diabolikdvd.com/product/election-1-and-2-chameleon-films-australia-blu-ray-all-region-preorder/\"&gt;ELECTION 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/a&gt; - Johnnie To (&lt;em&gt;Throwdown&lt;/em&gt;) made this secret history of Hong Kong, told through a triad election. This is the &lt;em&gt;Godfather 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/em&gt; of Hong Kong movies and while &lt;em&gt;Election 1&lt;/em&gt; is at times deliberately confusing (trust me, if you know who&amp;#39;s doing what at all times then you&amp;#39;re a smarter human than me)  the cumulative effect of these movies are emotionally devastating. If you&amp;#39;re falling for Johnnie To check out his Mainland movie, &lt;em&gt;Drug War&lt;/em&gt;, which is the Michael Mann movie Michael Mann never made but so much meaner. And if you think Mainland censorship kept &lt;em&gt;Drug War&lt;/em&gt; from being &amp;quot;About&amp;quot; anything, realize that every actor playing a drug dealer in the movie is from Hong Kong and every actor playing a cop is from Mainland China and everything takes on a new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything named above is an artsier movie, and I&amp;#39;m not even mentioning some classics that are incredibly hard to find like Fruit Chan&amp;#39;s remarkably moving street life portrait, &lt;em&gt;Little Cheung&lt;/em&gt;, or Tsui Hark&amp;#39;s Buddhist monster feature, &lt;em&gt;Green Snake&lt;/em&gt;, Herman Yau&amp;#39;s searing prison drama, &lt;em&gt;From the Queen to the Chief Executive&lt;/em&gt;, Wai Ka-fai&amp;#39;s Choose-Your-Own-Adventure crime film&lt;em&gt;, Too Many Ways to Be No. 1&lt;/em&gt;, or the animated ode to Hong Kong culture, &lt;em&gt;My Life as McDull&lt;/em&gt;. Check them out on YouTube in clips!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we get into the action movie side of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/1554-police-story-police-story-2\"&gt;POLICE STORY&lt;/a&gt; - Jackie Chan is the Buster Keaton of Hong Kong, and I mean that in every way. This is the first movie he really controlled, all the way from the action choreography, to the cinematography, to the editing, to his own performance. He made movies before &lt;em&gt;Police Story&lt;/em&gt; but this thing stands alone as a true masterpiece. It also marks the time when he moved firmly out of the shadow of his Big Brother, Sammo Hung, one of the greatest action filmmakers to walk the planet, and the man who picked up the genre and did the most to innovate action filmmaking after &lt;a href=\"https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/kaiju-shakedown-lau-kar-leung/\"&gt;Lau Kar-leung&lt;/a&gt;. You can see Jackie and Sammo together with their Little Brother, Yuen Biao, in the jaw-dropping &lt;a href=\"https://www.diabolikdvd.com/product/uhd-dragons-forever-us-88-films-release-4k-uhd-preorder/\"&gt;DRAGONS FOREVER&lt;/a&gt;, directed by Sammo.

He lives in his own world and takes matters into  \nhis own hands. He\u00eds a double-edged sword: On one hand, he\u00eds so egocentric that  \nhe simply creates his own path to success; But on the other hand, he is so  \ninconsiderate to those around him, and is destined to fail eventually.  \n\n\n**Q: Do you believe in the thin line between good and evil? How do you draw the line yourself?**  \nA: That is indeed an extremely thin line, and the definitions of good and evil vary from person to person. A moralistic person may find the \u00ecgood\u00ee is relatively confounding  \ncompared to the \u00ecevil\u00ee, where one could easily sidetrack to the dark side. If  \nyou\u00edre a gangster, it\u00eds the other way round, because they believe everything  \nthey do is justifiable. It\u00eds like Robin Hood robbing the rich to save the poor,  \nbecause he sees all rich people as filthy. But it never crosses his mind that  \nrobbing is a crime. Therefore, everyone has his or her own set of guidelines to  \ndefine good and evil.   \n**Q: How do you evaluate Sam\u00ed' action?**   \nA: Some say \"art imitates life imitates art\u00ee\" But art and life are still different entities. In  \nthe movie, Sam sees everything from his own eyes, and believes he\u00eds right all  \nthe time. In the opening scene when he talks about the good old days, he  \nbecomes sentimental when retelling the story of his six dead buddies. But then  \nSam is also ruthless and scheming when he places a mole inside the police force  \nin order to protect his own turf, and gets rid of anything in his way. If this  \ncharacter is a businessman, he will become very successful; If he\u00eds in the  \nTriads, he will become the boss. It all depends on which path he\u00eds taking, but  \nhe\u00ed' a kingpin nevertheless.   \n\n\n**Q: How does Sam protect himself from everything around him?**  \nA: His best defense is placing a mole in the police force. He is such a distinguished boss  \nin the Triads that his enemies would never expect this strategic move.  \n\n\nQ: Would you acknowledge people like Sam?  \nA: He\u00eds bad from the societal perspective. He\u00eds ruthless and sacrifices everyone just to secure his own status. But when I get into character, I find myself justifying Sam\u00eds decisions. He has to do evil to become what he is. It is immoral, of course; but when you\u00edve reached a certain age, perhaps you would do the same thing too.  \n**Q:** ***Infernal Affairs*** **is obviously a very masculine film. What is your take on that?**  \nA: It is the most masculine production since director Chang Cheh\u00eds works. In Chang\u00eds films, the female characters were irrelevant to the plot. It is the same with Jackie  \nChan\u00eds films. But those are in the martial arts genre. I believe *Infernal Affairs* is the first masculine drama that goes deep into the definition of good and evil.  \n\u00a0**Q: What should the audience expect in** ***Infernal Affairs*****?**  \nA: Simply put, it is a great film. It\u00eds a genre film with a dark twist on humanity. We have the  \nbest actors and idols in Hong Kong to portray the bad guys. It's worth the  \nticket just to see the ensemble on screen together.   \nQ: Which scene is your favorite?  \nA: The scene at the police station, where all four main cast are in the same room. I\u00edve yearned for a scene like this when I first got the script. Andy Lau, Tony Leung  \nChiu-wai and Anthony Wong are the ones I wish to work with. I especially like this  \nscene because it allows me to perform on a wide range of emotions. My death  \nscene is also special. I\u00edve died on screen numerous times, and when I read the  \nscript I was wondering how would I go this time. Kingpins often die with bullet  \nholes all over their bodies. But this time, my character dies so suddenly that  \nit would thrill the audience. The directors really staged that scene well.  \n**Q: What would your fans expect this time?**  \nA: My fans are accustomed to my comedic roles in the previous films. But this time they will  \nsee a serious Eric Tsang in a new acting method. I\u00edve played more upbeat  \ngangsters before, like in *Comrades, Almost a Love Story*. But this time it\u00eds a  \nsolemn and ruthless boss. Working alongside all these veteran actors made me on  \nguard at all times, and they drew the best performance out of me.  \n\n\nQ: Do you find it challenging to work with three award-winning actors together?  \nA: We are all serious about acting, and place the film above all else. Everyone wants to  \nspark new chemistry on screen, and we cherish the opportunity to work together.  \nSo we would be very dedicated to our own acting, and that is what makes this  \nfilm so special.\n\n  \nQ: What should the audience expect in Infernal Affairs?  \nA: They should expect a great film and an inspiring debate on humanity. There\u00edre so many  \ntalking points in the movie. When the audience walks out of the theatre, they  \ncould have a lengthy discussion with their friends: Which character do you side  \non, Andy Lau or Tony Leung?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERVIEW WITH ERIC TSANG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Q: Could you describe your character, Sam?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nA: Sam is visionary and self-confident.

In chronological order:\n\n**KING HU** may feel a little old fashioned these days but he started incorporating Chinese opera techniques into filmmaking and began going down a road with *Come Drink With Me* and [*Dragon Inn*](https://www.criterion.com/films/28790-dragon-inn) (and especially [*A Touch of Zen*](https://www.criterion.com/films/28791-a-touch-of-zen)) that culminated in flying swordsman extravaganzas like [*Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/zu-warriors-from-the-magic-mountain-xin-shu-shan-jian-ke/) (which essentially invented the modern day flying on a wire techniques that are now common practice) and [*The Bride with White Hair*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/the-bride-with-white-hair/).\n\nAt the same time, **Chang Cheh** and his action choreographer, Lau Kar-leung, began revolutionizing the *wu xia* (flying swordsman) movie, too, but then turned to kung fu. Some of their best collaborations are on [Arrow's Shaw Box](https://www.arrowfilms.com/blu-ray/shawscope-volume-one-limited-edition/13187252.html). **Lau Kar-leung** went out on his own a few years later and no one from any country brought the kind of innovation to action filmmaking that he did. There may be people making action movies you like better or that have better scripts, but no one thought about movement, martial arts, editing, and action the way Lau did. [You can read more about him from cinema studies stud David Bordwell](http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2022/03/13/lau-kar-leung-the-dragon-still-dances/), or check out his showcases like [*Legendary Weapons of China*](https://88-films.myshopify.com/collections/88-asia-collection/products/legendary-weapons-of-china-88-asia-30) or [*8 Diagram Pole Fighter*](https://88-films.myshopify.com/collections/88-asia-collection/products/the-eight-diagram-pole-fighter-88-asia-25).\n\nThe inheritor of Lau's mantle was **Sammo Hung** and you can see his early period of work best showcased in [*The Prodigal Son*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/warriors-two-and-the-prodigal-son-limited-edition-set/) although you can't go wrong with too many of his flicks. He made several contemporary movies (like [*Heart of the Dragon*](https://88-films.myshopify.com/products/heart-of-dragon), which may be a broad version of *Rain Man* starring Jackie and Sammo but which also features one of the most beautifully composed final fights I've ever seen) and started hitting peak Sammo with his Vietnam War movie, [*Eastern Condors*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/three-films-with-sammo-hung-the-iron-fisted-monk-the-magnificent-butcher-eastern-condors/), and gave them a Canto-comedy twist with [*Millionaire's Express*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/the-millionaires-express-limited-edition-set-3000-copies/). **Yuen Wo-ping** popped up around this time with his two collaborations with Jackie Chan, [*Snake in Eagle's Shadow*](https://88-films.myshopify.com/products/snake-in-the-eagles-shadow) and [*Drunken Master*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/drunken-master/), and Yuen would go on to deliver some master-class level choreography in Tsui Hark's [*Once Upon a Time in China*](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/5026-once-upon-a-time-in-china-the-complete-films) series, especially part 2, which is preserved on a great Criterion box set. If you want to see weirdzo early Yuen Wo-ping working alongside his brothers, often billed at the Yuen Clan, check out [*Dreadnaught*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/dreadnaught/). The Yuen Clan have almost all since gone on to work in the West on Hollywood productions.\n\nOne of the most interesting double features to watch is [*Project A* and *Project A2*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/jackie-chans-project-a-and-project-a-part-ii-2/) which are **Jackie Chan** movies but the first was directed by Sammo and the second by Jackie. They really showcase what each one brought to the picture as they turned Jackie Chan into Jackie Fucking Chan, king of action movies. What it all boils down to is: Jackie runs, Sammo doesn't. Jackie ducks, Sammo bleeds. If you check out a movie like [*Dragons Forever*](https://88-films.myshopify.com/collections/88-asia-collection/products/dragons-forever) you get a great finale that feels like Sammo, but not before a chase on a boat that feels 100% Jackie. Watch *Dragons Forever* for Jackie + Sammo (with Sammo as the boss because he's Big Brother) and then check out Jackie really come into his own with [*Police Story*](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/1554-police-story-police-story-2) \u2014 you'll see two totally different approaches to action filmmaking. Jackie is much less ambitious as a director, shooting most of his action scenes with a fixed camera and not attempting anything too ambitious because he doesn't want to interfere with the audience experience of the action. Everything interesting in Jackie's action setpieces happens inside the frame. With Sammo, the frame itself is sometimes the most interesting part.\n\nTo me, the next really interesting stage in action evolution were the two movies **Tsui Hark and Xiong Xin-xin** (who plays Clubfoot in *OUATIC III*) made together, [*The Blade*](https://youtu.be/91Mgsy2BLms) (which isn't on a good blu ray as far as I know) and [*Time and Tide*](https://eurekavideo.co.uk/movie/time-and-tide/), which is. Focusing on improvisation and speed they forged a new way of shooting action that you can see glimpses of in Tsui and Xiong's JCVD movie [*Double Team*](https://88-films.myshopify.com/products/double-team), but that feels like it really gets developed more thoroughly in **Gareth Evans'** *The Raid*. **Tony Jaa, Panna Rittikrai, and Prachya Pinkaew** delivered the closest thing to a modern Jackie Chan movie with *Ong Bak*, featuring Jaa in the Chan role doing chases, stunts, and fight scenes, and it looked like they were taking that in a new direction with *The Protector*, but then Jaa took over the franchise and it became much more of a Yuen Clan kind of endeavor.

Nothing wrong with that, but it was ground we&amp;#39;ve been over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_u0cw7e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/criterion/comments/u0cw7e/hard_boiled_1992_is_still_the_greatest_action/i45zn02/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/criterion/comments/u0cw7e/hard_boiled_1992_is_still_the_greatest_action/", "name": "t1_i45zn02", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/criterion", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1649600348.0, "created_utc": 1649600348.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 50, "id": "award_69c94eb4-d6a3-48e7-9cf2-0f39fed8b87c", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 0, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12f18f484af14d4a593c0eeca2ddf0104fcafbea", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a86cd430c009186819c61a9f12cc6010529da93a", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5acf096034215626ed92aba3219a3e02a5270013", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8ae29304ad7bd8f005a2a6baf2268dc4e721f59a", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d258ce2dd4a244a34f9a37bcf05ecc0a7dbd9e8f", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Listen, get educated, and get involved.", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 2048, "name": "Ally", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12f18f484af14d4a593c0eeca2ddf0104fcafbea", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a86cd430c009186819c61a9f12cc6010529da93a", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5acf096034215626ed92aba3219a3e02a5270013", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8ae29304ad7bd8f005a2a6baf2268dc4e721f59a", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d258ce2dd4a244a34f9a37bcf05ecc0a7dbd9e8f", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": "PNG", "icon_height": 2048, "penny_price": 0, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/5nswjpyy44551_Ally.png"}], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/u0cw7e"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3dast", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Classic Bollywood?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 8, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "boutiquebluray", "link_author": "al455", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i45vj6k", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "GradyHendrix", "num_comments": 1, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_u0efji", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_4wea7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is my entirely uninformed opinion, so take that for what it's worth.
