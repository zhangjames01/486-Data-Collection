Or they make you think you want something and they give it to you and you realize you never wanted it and want them to take it backkkkk&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really do think that binging it can kind of diminish the hype experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3agdk0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/gameofthrones/comments/3agdk0/tv_talk_about_a_disappointment/cscpmjy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3agdk0/tv_talk_about_a_disappointment/", "name": "t1_cscpmjy", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gameofthrones", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1434783175.0, "created_utc": 1434783175.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3agdk0/tv_talk_about_a_disappointment/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rjz2", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[All Spoilers] My dream season 5 ending", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "gameofthrones", "link_author": "houndogs007", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "csc2haj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "jordanlag", "num_comments": 14, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3aetjx", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_574ug", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So much hype", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much hype&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3aetjx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/gameofthrones/comments/3aetjx/all_spoilers_my_dream_season_5_ending/csc2haj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3aetjx/all_spoilers_my_dream_season_5_ending/", "name": "t1_csc2haj", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gameofthrones", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1434735656.0, "created_utc": 1434735656.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3aetjx/all_spoilers_my_dream_season_5_ending/"}}], "before": null}}
