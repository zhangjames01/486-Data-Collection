A vaccinated person is primed to produce T-cells and B-cells more quickly and in greater numbers that can attack the virus before it is able to sufficiently invade cells and multiply in order to cause disease. If this happens successfully a person will not test positive for the disease. If this happens in a large group of people **there will be fewer recorded incidences of infection compared to a control group.** The same response from a non-vaccinated person will be slower and therefore is more likely to allow the virus to replicate enough to cause detectable or even severe disease.\n\nBy extension, the reduced viral load in vaccinated individuals can mean they are less likely to pass on the disease to others. **This means there will be fewer recorded incidences of infection**. If this damper on transmission is great enough, and enough people are vaccinated, the virus will not be able to easily transmit between people and will eventually be snuffed out. This is an extremely well established principle.\n\nOf course the degree to which this all happens is dependent on the efficacy of the vaccine. Certain vaccines are good enough as to produce sterilising immunity (e.g. the HPV vaccine) whereby the immune response is so effective that virus cannot be transmitted to others. **This means there will be fewer recorded incidences of infection**.\n\nI can see that you're clinging to a semantic argument of recorded infections vs 'did the virus technically enter the body even though it caused no harm and could not be detected'. This isn't a clever insight. It goes without saying.  If it helps your ego to argue minutiae then so be it. It doesn't change the context of the situation and  doesn't mean that vaccines suddenly don't work.\n\nFor what it's worth, you can replace my bolded sentences with 'fewer recorded cases of infection', 'fewer recorded cases of disease' or whatever. Doing so doesn't revolutionise vaccine science and the well-evidenced principles still stand. Principles that stand up to meta-analysis which ivermectin as a covid treatment is yet to btw.\n\nTo use your own word, you are clearly dumb but I bet even you could point out on a cases graph of polio, measles, pertussis, diphtheria, group C meningococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, etc. the point at which vaccines were introduced.\n\nTo hammer the point home:\n\n*\"Two doses of BNT162b2 are* ***highly effective*** *across all age groups (\u226516 years, including older adults aged \u226585 years)* ***in*** ***preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections*** *and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage.

A vaccinated person is primed to produce T-cells and B-cells more quickly and in greater numbers that can attack the virus before it is able to sufficiently invade cells and multiply in order to cause disease. If this happens successfully a person will not test positive for the disease. If this happens in a large group of people &lt;strong&gt;there will be fewer recorded incidences of infection compared to a control group.&lt;/strong&gt; The same response from a non-vaccinated person will be slower and therefore is more likely to allow the virus to replicate enough to cause detectable or even severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By extension, the reduced viral load in vaccinated individuals can mean they are less likely to pass on the disease to others. &lt;strong&gt;This means there will be fewer recorded incidences of infection&lt;/strong&gt;. If this damper on transmission is great enough, and enough people are vaccinated, the virus will not be able to easily transmit between people and will eventually be snuffed out. This is an extremely well established principle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course the degree to which this all happens is dependent on the efficacy of the vaccine. Certain vaccines are good enough as to produce sterilising immunity (e.g. the HPV vaccine) whereby the immune response is so effective that virus cannot be transmitted to others. &lt;strong&gt;This means there will be fewer recorded incidences of infection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see that you&amp;#39;re clinging to a semantic argument of recorded infections vs &amp;#39;did the virus technically enter the body even though it caused no harm and could not be detected&amp;#39;. This isn&amp;#39;t a clever insight. It goes without saying.  If it helps your ego to argue minutiae then so be it. It doesn&amp;#39;t change the context of the situation and  doesn&amp;#39;t mean that vaccines suddenly don&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#39;s worth, you can replace my bolded sentences with &amp;#39;fewer recorded cases of infection&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;fewer recorded cases of disease&amp;#39; or whatever. Doing so doesn&amp;#39;t revolutionise vaccine science and the well-evidenced principles still stand.
