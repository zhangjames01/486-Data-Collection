I just knew. Sure, the Mass felt boring/tiring and sometimes my parents watching or talking about God was kind of fastidious, but all the teachings and everything we learned about Our Lord Jesus I understood as Truth.\n\nAs I grew up, I found myself caught in a very deep juxtaposition: I couldn't put together God's Truth with the world that I lived in. The contrast was so great!\n\nOut of nowhere, I found myself in a chapel with the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nI now understand that this was not a coincidence, but He was leading me out of His Love and Mercy.\n\nIt was funny because I found myself going there when I had \"time in between\" places or otherwise had nowhere else to go. \n\nAn accurate reflection of my life up until that point.\n\nI had many personal issues with God due to events that happened in my life that I wish had not happened, but one day in the abyss of my despair, I cried out to God sincerely. I was trying to tell Him: I know You're there, but *where*?\n\nAfter many years, God continued calling me in, but always giving me the space I needed. One day, I began praying the Rosary to Our Blessed Mother, and from that point *everything changed quite literally*.\n\nI credit Our Blessed Mother for the faith I have now and the dramatic change in my life. It's true, she did not grant it to me, but as co-redemptrix, she is the mediatrix of all graces. \n\nIt was as if my eyes were opened and I began to understand all of those things that I had been taught throughout my entire life. Of course I still had questions, but there is so much material out there now that I haven't really had a problem researching more deeply about my faith.\n\nNow, I have a deep and sincere love for the Eucharist and for Our Blessed Mother, and I will continue walking on this path with both of them.\n\nSorry for the long post, I thought this perspective may help you somewhat. I would suggest praying to Our Lady and looking into the lives of saints. The lives of saints have also helped me a lot during this journey.\n\n The greatest thing I could suggest would be to spend some time before the Blessed Sacrament. You could do so now via live-streams (YouTube or maybe your parish is having some adoration via FaceBook) and of course when it becomes accessible again you could go in person.

I just knew. Sure, the Mass felt boring/tiring and sometimes my parents watching or talking about God was kind of fastidious, but all the teachings and everything we learned about Our Lord Jesus I understood as Truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I grew up, I found myself caught in a very deep juxtaposition: I couldn&amp;#39;t put together God&amp;#39;s Truth with the world that I lived in. The contrast was so great!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, I found myself in a chapel with the Blessed Sacrament.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I now understand that this was not a coincidence, but He was leading me out of His Love and Mercy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was funny because I found myself going there when I had &amp;quot;time in between&amp;quot; places or otherwise had nowhere else to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An accurate reflection of my life up until that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had many personal issues with God due to events that happened in my life that I wish had not happened, but one day in the abyss of my despair, I cried out to God sincerely. I was trying to tell Him: I know You&amp;#39;re there, but &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After many years, God continued calling me in, but always giving me the space I needed. One day, I began praying the Rosary to Our Blessed Mother, and from that point &lt;em&gt;everything changed quite literally&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I credit Our Blessed Mother for the faith I have now and the dramatic change in my life. It&amp;#39;s true, she did not grant it to me, but as co-redemptrix, she is the mediatrix of all graces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was as if my eyes were opened and I began to understand all of those things that I had been taught throughout my entire life. Of course I still had questions, but there is so much material out there now that I haven&amp;#39;t really had a problem researching more deeply about my faith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a deep and sincere love for the Eucharist and for Our Blessed Mother, and I will continue walking on this path with both of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post, I thought this perspective may help you somewhat. I would suggest praying to Our Lady and looking into the lives of saints. The lives of saints have also helped me a lot during this journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The greatest thing I could suggest would be to spend some time before the Blessed Sacrament.
