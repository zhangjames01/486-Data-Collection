The only terms that would be used to refer to Chechnyans &lt;em&gt;in English&lt;/em&gt; would be &amp;quot;Chechnyans&amp;quot; or probably more likely just &amp;quot;Russian&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The vernacular of one language &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be literally translated into another language and still make sense. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If OP was upset about a word that had multiple meanings in English, one of which was insulting, this would be a dumb problem, but I could see where she was coming from, but that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s going on here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_vd51v9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vd51v9/aita_for_siding_with_my_parents_and_get_upset/icy5w3l/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vd51v9/aita_for_siding_with_my_parents_and_get_upset/", "name": "t1_icy5w3l", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AmItheAsshole", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1655649817.0, "created_utc": 1655649817.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vd51v9/aita_for_siding_with_my_parents_and_get_upset/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xhvq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "AITA for siding with my parents and get upset after my husband said we are Caucasian?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AmItheAsshole", "link_author": "TAnotacaucasian", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "icy4xn9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "codayus", "num_comments": 117, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_icj3em9", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_7q9yd", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The term has a really dumb history, but it was originally created to mean all inhabitants of Europe, North Africa (ie, Berbers and Egyptions), West Asian (Arabs and Hebrews), and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nSee, the theory was that Noah's Ark landed in the Caucasus Mountains, so all modern humanity must have started spreading out from there, so basically, everyone who lived fairly close to the area probably hasn't diverged too much, and thus must be \"purer\", whereas the further away from the Caucasus you go, the less like a real biblical human you must be.

Here's a little story.\n\nJan 2022: Putin thinks he needs a short, victorious war to shore up domestic opinion, cement his legacy, show the weakness of NATO, and divide the West. He selects Ukraine as the target, believing that they will be an easy win. His expectation is victory within 72 hours, demonstrating to all that Ukraine is, in fact, not a real nation, and certainly not one worth fighting for, since even the Ukrainians will not.\n\nFeb 2022: Nothing works out as expected. Ukrainian resistance does not collapse, the Russian advances are badly stalled, and the West, rather than fragmenting, enacts sanctions with real bite. Putin understands that he can't give up *now* without fatally weakening Russia, himself, and his legacy. He also understands that Russia is ill-equipped for a long drawn out campaign; Russia simply doesn't have the materiel needed, as their stockpiles of fuel, parts, and ammo rapidly approach exhaustion due to the weak Russian economy and their terrible logistics, both of which are exacerbated by the unexpected sanctions.\n\nMar 2022: With, as he sees it, no other options, Putin orders victory at any cost. Aleppo and Grozny come to Europe as indiscriminate indirect fire and house-to-house urban fighting is used to suppress the defence of the remaining Ukrainian population centres. Russia wins, but at punishing cost. Russian domestic opinion is soured, the Ukrainian resistance is utterly implacable, and Western support for Ukrainian is adamantine.\n\nNov 2022: The eastern edge of NATO is becoming densely militarised, both as a defence in case Putin chooses to repeat his attack on Ukraine against Poland or Romania, but also to help support the Ukrainian resistance with safe houses, training, and materiel. And although NATO forces do stop currently serving members of their armed forces crossing the border, no few civilian volunteers with military experience have remembered (or invented) Ukrainian heritage and operate freely in Ukraine.  After some initial victories, the puppet government in Ukraine feels under siege; precious few Ukrainians are willing to collaborate with the \"butcher of Kyiv\", so they're reliant on Russia's occupation forces, but the Ukrainian insurgents are just as numerous, much more motivated, better trained than any Russian forces outside of their elite special forces, generally better equipped, and have access to the best intelligence the West can provide. This is starting to feel less like a insurgency than a hot war to Russia, and one they're losing.\n\nMar 2023: A Ukrainian resistance patrol is captured and, being out of uniform, summarily executed. Unfortunately, several of the fighters are EU/NATO citizens. After some initial debate, Western public opinion crystallises on the view that this is just a further outrage by the butcher of Kyiv. Any limits previously observed on support for Ukraine are removed, and without a lot of discussion, NATO stops enforcing the rule about keeping their own soldiers on their side of the border, and NATO \"trainers\" often accompany Ukrainian forces.\n\nJun 12th 2023: A mixed Ukrainian/German/Polish force takes out a good chunk of the occupation government (and a few of their family members as collateral damage, but it's been a while since anyone on either side cared about *that*). Russia's garrison was out of position to to stop them or catch them, but they track them back to the Polish border. History does not record who made the call, but with heavy air support, they follow, and hit the base inside Polish territory, killing most of the force.\n\nJun 13th 2023: Invoking article 5 after an attack on a NATO seems more like a formality than anything else, but it's done nonetheless, and the NATO troops prepositioned along the eastern border start rolling before the ink is even dry. Russia is caught flat footed, although it would hardly matter if they weren't; they can't realistically stop this. Over a year of active combat operations has left them a hollow shell. NATO announces they are merely liberating the free nation of Ukraine; Russia counters this is an unprovoked attack on a Russian province. Nobody is listening. Russia's veto in the security council is irrelevant; no UN resolutions are even proposed.\n\nJun 16th 2023: NATO forces have overrun Ukraine; Russian forces have fallen back within their historical borders. Putin's humiliation seems complete, and he's aware he's unlikely to remain in power more than another few weeks, one way or another. He convinces himself that he acted strictly for the good of Russia, and he worries that this set back may undo all he has worked to achieve. He worries, in particular, that NATO's claim that they will stop at the historical Ukrainian borders is a lie. Why would they stop there? He wouldn't.\n\nJun 18th 2023: A popular revolt erupts in Belarus, and his put down harshly. The leader of the Belarusian resistance asks for NATO intervention.\n\nJun 19th 2023: NATO agrees; tanks roll across the border of Belarus. The leader of Belarus appeals to Putin for help. Putin sees this as the proof he was looking for; NATO is not just recovering Ukraine, but is dismembering Russia. He issues an angry speech justifying his actions, and orders the use of tactical nuclear weapons against NATO forces on Ukraine soil. He tells himself that if he can just prove that he - and Russia - remain strong, and throw NATO forces back, and give himself a bit of breathing room, he can still recover. Surely.\n\nNATO forces react to the use of nuclear weapons against them, on European soil, by.... &lt;fill in the blank&gt;.\n\nAnd of course, there's a ton of other paths that lead to similar outcomes. But....yes. In some ways the optimal choice for avoiding nuclear war in the short term, once Russia attacked, was for Ukraine to fold without fighting. That hasn't happened, and that increase the risks. Putin is unlikely to give up, but knocking Ukraine out will be bloody. A Ukrainian resistance seems inevitable, as does Western support for it, including access to safehouses in NATO members like Poland, money, and arms. Fighting an insurgency is *hard*, and safehouses in a putatively neutral country is a huge force multiplier (as Americans, and others, have learned over and over again). How many times will Russian forces be okay with watching their opponents melt away before they do something rash? Conversely, fighting an insurgency is very, very bloody. How many times with NATO forces be okay with watching their Ukrainian friends and neighbours be massacred before they do something rash? A huge part of MAD is the idea that nuclear powers can't afford to get into a hot war because of the risk of escalation, but an active Ukrainian insurgency, closely supported by the West, is damn close to a hot war. But if Ukraine continues to fight, continues their excellent PR efforts, and Russia has to resort to escalating levels of violence to size urban population centres, with the mass casualties that implies....how will their not be an active resistance with close Western support?\n\nEdit: I should note that, as others have stated, Ukraine's military defence is going shockingly well, but it's still vanishingly unlikely that they could *win*. The odds are exceptionally good that Russia will crush them. What's up in the air is whether it'll be fast or slow, cheap or expensive, whether they'll occupy some or all of Ukraine's population centres, whether they'll set up a puppet government or try and absorb Ukraine into Russia, whether they'll seize the entirety of Ukraine or partition it into West Ukraine and an East Ukraine, etc. And of course, what's up in the air is what happens next. In some ways, Ukraine's PR victories may contribute more to the likelihood of there being a free Ukraine in 30 years than any number of Russian tanks blown up, because blowing up a Russian tank in all likelihood just slows down their victory, but a viral story about Ukrainian soldiers and their cats (or whatever) will cement Western support for an inevitable Ukrainian resistance. Unfortunately, Western support for a Ukrainian resistance is not without existential risk.\n\nEdit 2: Also, there's a non-zero chance that the aid being supplied to Ukraine now may be seen as crossing some sort of red line. Putin has claimed a willingness to use nuclear weapons if NATO soldiers deploy to Ukraine. But according to AFP this morning, Denmark is allowing volunteers to join a \"foreign brigade\" in Ukraine, and Western countries are funnelling weapons to Ukraine. If Putin comes to feel that he would have already defeated Ukraine but for this aid, the difference between German soldiers deployed to Ukraine, or Danish volunteers using weapons donated by Germany may seem unimportant. None of which is to say we shouldn't support Ukraine.
