I also had to buy grad student insurance, but the insurance program covered half of it, so that wasn't very expensive either.\n\nBasically, in order to keep the stipend as long as I was studying, I had to make progress toward my degree and student teach the first year, then teach 3 classes the next year. I was doing English studies, though, and I know that science programs often have you serve as a TA instead of doing the teaching yourself. If your undergrad experience is unrelated, usually they have some sort of training program before they throw you into the classroom.\n\nLike you said, the program funding wasn't great, but it was enough for me to pay my bills and eat reasonably well for two years.
