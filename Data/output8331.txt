The pay is REAL BAD the first few years so be prepared for that. In fact, a few people quit because of the pay. But I couldn&amp;#39;t trade this lifestyle for ANYTHING. I LOVE the random schedules. Yea you can work 13 hours one day, but the next day you could work like 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love that I get free domestic flights and super cheap international flights (I can go to Hong Kong first class for $34). I&amp;#39;m tired a lot ... and sometimes passengers are SOOOO ANNOYING OMG....but I also love working so I pick up trips even on my days off :P &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You either love it or hate it haha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4zad2u", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/flightattendants/comments/4zad2u/future_hopefully_fado_any_of_you_or_any_fa_you/d6z8gv9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/4zad2u/future_hopefully_fado_any_of_you_or_any_fa_you/", "name": "t1_d6z8gv9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/flightattendants", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1472333391.0, "created_utc": 1472333391.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flightattendants/comments/4zad2u/future_hopefully_fado_any_of_you_or_any_fa_you/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vb78", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Future (hopefully) FA:Do any of you or any FA you know have tattoos?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "flightattendants", "link_author": "Gracie1194", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d6z7oix", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Pandoraa", "num_comments": 17, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d6z6gb9", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4819w", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is what she said: \n\n\"I said I had no visible tattoos.
