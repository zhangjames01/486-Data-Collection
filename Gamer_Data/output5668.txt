What is so bad about time-gating? How does it affect you other than &lt;a href=\"http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/09/Tantrum-Throwing-a-fit-Veruca-Salt-Rage-GIF.gif?gs=a\"&gt;&amp;quot;I want it &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, daddy&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2 of them are ready that just means that the whole 9 exotics are ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I... don&amp;#39;t have words to explain how stupid this statement is, so I&amp;#39;m not going to try and I&amp;#39;m just going to move on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I do agree that there should be some statement made about where the exotics are. I&amp;#39;m curious, too. But if, when they do make a statement, they&amp;#39;re not available due to time-gating, I&amp;#39;ll be just fine with that, too. I think it&amp;#39;s more exciting this way, like every week we&amp;#39;re getting new, free content.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Instead of just downvoting me because you don&amp;#39;t agree and moving on, can we have an actual discussion here? I&amp;#39;d like to try and argue my side, but that&amp;#39;s difficult when I don&amp;#39;t get the chance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3o8bot", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3o8bot/bungie_what_is_the_point_behind_adding_18_exotic/cvv0ak8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3o8bot/bungie_what_is_the_point_behind_adding_18_exotic/", "name": "t1_cvv0ak8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DestinyTheGame", "author_flair_text": "Spooky Scary", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1444502914.0, "created_utc": 1444502914.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3o8bot/bungie_what_is_the_point_behind_adding_18_exotic/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vq0w", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Xur Megathread [2015-10-09]", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DestinyTheGame", "link_author": "DTG_Bot", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cvuzvia", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "I_Have_No_Idea_What", "num_comments": 2207, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3o2w43", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_dp4nj", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So, has anyone confirmed that Legacy Engrams are the way to get Y1 bounty exotics now?
