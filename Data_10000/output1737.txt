You imagine that imgur makes this feature available purely for the lulz, because they can power their servers with candy canes and fairy dust? You think imgur would invest all this time and money in attracting this traffic if it was a total revenue drain for them and there was no value in it? As I have explained to you time and time again, the advertising business is all about eyeballs, and the more of those, the better. Yahoo will find a way to make money from them if they buy imgur. \n\n&gt; Fair use is not black and white, never has been and never will. \n\nWho claimed that it was?\n\n&gt; That sentence was clearly pointing out a continuum of use purpose, with the scummiest kind being uses that profit off of the copyrighted work (remember we're still talking about the OP and his karma) and the most innocent kind being that which does good in the world through helping people learn in an educational sense. \n\nAnd once again, you demonstrate a complete and staggering inability to read. Fair use, as a term of law, requires a number of factors to be considered in deciding whether a use of a copyrighted work is Fair Use. *Whether the person committing the infringement profited from that infringement is not one of them*. It does not matter that the person stealing the image made no money from the theft. It's not Fair Use unless the use is criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research. Which of these uses applies in this case? I see no criticism, neither do I see comment, nor do I see news reporting, or teaching, or scholarship, or research. I see an entire copyrighted work copied. End of story. If the use of the work *did* fall under one of the above factors, *then* the consideration of profit would come into play. If you make copies for educational purposes but make a profit on the copies, that is not Fair Use. \n\nYou cannot take a copyrighted work, host it on another site in its entirety, and then claim Fair Use because all you got for it was imaginary internet points. Just as you can't take a television program, or a song, and give it to others and then claim that it's not copyright infringement because you made no money from it. \n\n&gt; The OP got imaginary points and made lots of people laugh, doesn't seem that scummy to me.\n\nThere would have been just as many laughs had the link been to the website of the artist who made the work, and that artist would have gotten the page views he deserved and possibly ad revenue or sales of merchandise. But he got little, if any, of the pageviews. People got to see his copyrighted work, but in a way that denied him credit and page views and the chance to show more of his work. That is as scummy and reprehensible as can be imagined.\n\n&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1ty4z2/the_future_of_phones_1956/\n\nWhat is the relevance of this?\n\n&gt; 4 on /r/funny. don't bother reporting it. or do, i'm just trying to save you the headache, because they're not going to agree with you either.\n\nI don't subscribe to /r/funny. However, I do note in their sidebar: \n\n&gt;&gt; Do not rehost webcomics \tRehosted webcomics will be removed. Please submit a link to the original comic's site and preferably an imgur link in the comments. Do not post a link to the comic image, it must be linked to the page of the comic. (*) (*)\n\nSound familiar? \n\n&gt; So incredibly unbelievable, huh? Thanks, I appreciate feeling like a unique and special snowflake, now go fuck yourself. Finding quality content is hard, why wouldn't I check the comments or do an image search for the source? right-click -&gt; search google for image. wow, that took so much effort!\n\nIt's a damn sight more effort than just clicking on a link to the artist's website in the first place. If you're too lazy to do this, why should I believe that you will take the trouble to do the reverse image search. I suspect you've never done a reverse image search either, simply because reverse image search rarely finds webcomic sources that quickly. I find myself doing a lot of searching for webcomic sources thanks to the proliferation of selfish assholes who re-host comics on imgur, and it sometimes takes hours to track the source down when Google returns pages and pages of sites like imgur and funnyjunk, crammed to the brim with stolen artwork. And guess who we have to thank for that? Take a bow, because this is what you have helped to bring about. This is the internet that you have helped to create.\n\nThe question is: when you have reduced the internet to a wasteland of imgur re-hosted images, and all the artists give up and go away, what then will you do? Will you sit around bitching about there's nothing good on reddit any more? Will you feel even the smallest smidgin of guilt that this is *your* fault? That you made this happen? But no, I am supposing a degree of self-knowledge that clearly is not in evidence. I suspect you and your ilk, like the swarms of locusts that infest crops, will move onto the next source of free stuff and start work destroying that too.\n\n&gt; If I didn't see an artist's comic on reddit, I would have seen something else on reddit. Not their comic. \n\nSince the artist gets no benefit from your viewing of the comic, why should you get to see the comic at all? All they ask is that you come to their site if you want to see their wares. If you don't want to do that, if you cannot bear the thought that you won't like what you see, then don't view their work at all. Go look at pictures of cats.\n\n&gt; I don't get how you don't see that replacing cat picture #23 on a person's reddit feed with a rehosted comic doesn't hurt the artist of the comic. It's not like the artist was getting traffic from the user in the first place.\n\nThe artist is trying to earn some kind of living from their copyrighted work. Someone takes that work, re-hosts it, so now people see the work but do not visit the artist's site, do not view the ads on the artist's site, do not see the merchandise for sale on the artist's site. How can you not see that you have hurt the artist by taking their work and putting it somewhere where no-one will know where it came from or who made it? Someone else is getting benefit from the work, imgur gets page views, but the artist who made the thing gets nothing. The morality is so simple that a child could see it.\n\n&gt; Insult me again and I'm reporting you to the mods. \n\nOh no! The person who openly and proudly flouts the rules of this subreddit, who steals and advocates for the continued stealing of copyrighted works, is going to report me for being mean? Goodness me! \n\nAllow me to offer this rejoinder: You cretinous dripping of the gangrenous scrotum of a diseased water-buffalo. Your person is malodorous, your conversation puerile, your voice grates harshly on the ears. At your coming, elderly women touch their religious icons and hide their spoons. Cockroaches, rats and mice brave the winter blast rather than share the same roof as you. \n\n&gt; I'm getting real tired of your shit and it's adding nothing to the discussion.\n\nIf it serves to express the depth and degree of my contempt for the way that you rip off comic artists and then justify it with self-serving, laughable excuses, it will suffice for my purposes. There is no discussion, because a discussion requires the exchange of arguments based on evidence, not recitation of excuses as to why clicking a link is just tooooo harrrddd! \n\n&gt; I've addressed this, you don't \"earn\" anything until you've delivered something of worth. crap comics are not worth the time to read. Therefore, crap artists haven't earned anything.\n\nYou didn't address anything. The artist, no matter how incompetent, by dint of putting something online has earned the right, the only right, the *copy* right, to that work. They alone get to decide the manner in which that work is viewed. If you don't want to visit their site, there are millions of others to which you are welcome to fuck off. But you don't get to steal their work so that you can preview it in order to decide whether the artist's site is worth visiting. \n", "edited": 1388359693.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eicjf/im_the_imgur_guy_ama_part_two/c18asmj\"&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eicjf/im_the_imgur_guy_ama_part_two/c18asmj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, a comment from three years ago claiming hotlinked images can&amp;#39;t be monetised?

In any subreddit in which I have seen a re-hosted or stolen copyrighted work, the moderators have removed that image once I reported the violation. I see no reason to suppose that there is any subreddit where the moderators would encourage copyright infringement, and I am certain the owners of reddit would react rather strongly if they discovered that a subreddit was doing that.\n\n&gt; Thing is, at the moment I am providing a benefit but no harm to the artists, whereas if I leave I provide no benefit at all. . The benefit is that if a comic is good, I'll find the source and see more of the artists work on their site. \n\nAnd once again, you dazzle me with your self-indulgent, narcissistic notions of your own importance. You provide no benefit whatsoever to any comic creator. You happily steal their work and encourage others to steal their work merely for your convenience, because the effort of clicking a link is too much trouble. Then, in defence of your laziness, you make this laughably transparent lie that you will go to the trouble of finding the source if you like the comic. Really, how gullible do you think we are? If you are too lazy to click on a link to see if a comic is good, you can hardly expect me to believe that you will go to the trouble of doing a reverse image search to find the source if you like it.\n\n&gt; There is no harm because imgur gets no ad views off me. \n\nLet me see if I understand this. Are you seriously claiming that when you view a stolen comic, if there are no ads on it, no harm is done to the artist? I want to be clear on this, because I am totally flabbergasted that any adult could make such a claim with a straight face. \n\nThe presence or absence of ads has to do with the manner in which imgur profits from the theft, but the artist suffers the same regardless of whether there are ads or not. Despite making the art that the user wants to view, the user is directed to imgur, not the artist's site, and you are here claiming that the artist has lost nothing? This transcends immorality and achieves a kind of sublime and transcendent ignorance that must surely make you the Buddha of greedy self-absorbed narcissists everywhere.\n\n&gt; You may have just meant this as another insult, but if 1,000 people like me subscribed to this subreddit, the artists would see their pageviews increase a noticeable amount.\n\nIf a thousand morons like you subscribed, artists would see a tiny proportion of the pageviews their art had earned, if any, because you would all be re-hosting the comics on imgur and clicking on those instead. If 10 people like me joined, who report imgur rehosters and only follow links to artist websites, the artists would benefit far more than from all 1000 of those like you.\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Actually it kind of is.

I see no reason to suppose that there is any subreddit where the moderators would encourage copyright infringement, and I am certain the owners of reddit would react rather strongly if they discovered that a subreddit was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thing is, at the moment I am providing a benefit but no harm to the artists, whereas if I leave I provide no benefit at all. . The benefit is that if a comic is good, I&amp;#39;ll find the source and see more of the artists work on their site. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And once again, you dazzle me with your self-indulgent, narcissistic notions of your own importance. You provide no benefit whatsoever to any comic creator. You happily steal their work and encourage others to steal their work merely for your convenience, because the effort of clicking a link is too much trouble. Then, in defence of your laziness, you make this laughably transparent lie that you will go to the trouble of finding the source if you like the comic. Really, how gullible do you think we are? If you are too lazy to click on a link to see if a comic is good, you can hardly expect me to believe that you will go to the trouble of doing a reverse image search to find the source if you like it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is no harm because imgur gets no ad views off me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me see if I understand this. Are you seriously claiming that when you view a stolen comic, if there are no ads on it, no harm is done to the artist? I want to be clear on this, because I am totally flabbergasted that any adult could make such a claim with a straight face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The presence or absence of ads has to do with the manner in which imgur profits from the theft, but the artist suffers the same regardless of whether there are ads or not. Despite making the art that the user wants to view, the user is directed to imgur, not the artist&amp;#39;s site, and you are here claiming that the artist has lost nothing? This transcends immorality and achieves a kind of sublime and transcendent ignorance that must surely make you the Buddha of greedy self-absorbed narcissists everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You may have just meant this as another insult, but if 1,000 people like me subscribed to this subreddit, the artists would see their pageviews increase a noticeable amount.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If a thousand morons like you subscribed, artists would see a tiny proportion of the pageviews their art had earned, if any, because you would all be re-hosting the comics on imgur and clicking on those instead. If 10 people like me joined, who report imgur rehosters and only follow links to artist websites, the artists would benefit far more than from all 1000 of those like you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1ti8ol", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/webcomics/comments/1ti8ol/actually_the_worst_punishment/cecpwia/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webcomics/comments/1ti8ol/actually_the_worst_punishment/", "name": "t1_cecpwia", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webcomics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1388346299.0, "created_utc": 1388346299.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://i.imgur.com/xqxSrr0.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2w", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Actually the worst punishment.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "webcomics", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cec62al", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "rosetta_stoned", "num_comments": 68, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cebmqlx", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_1ld8b", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; They don't make money from traffic, or pageviews, or Alexa rankings, they lose money from traffic.

And guess what, imgur is currently in talks with Yahoo about a buyout: http://www.businessinsider.com/imgur-and-yahoo-acquisition-talks-2013-12\n\nSo, to recap, imgur has grown popular by encouraging its users to steal other peoples' stuff and host it on imgur's servers, thus giving imgur ad revenue and page views, making it a large site and an attractive prospect for buyers. The people who run imgur will become wealthy. The poor schmucks who made the art that was stolen, well, they may or may not get some publicity, and a giant fuck-you from the imgur community.\n\nAnd this is why, despite having the greatest platform for new and interesting art and music and movies ever designed, here we are in 2013 with the artists and creators getting screwed while internet companies run by so-called techno-utopians get rich. The creators and artists are putting their stuff out there for no cost, asking nothing in return but that we visit their sites and possibly buy their merchandise while we're there, assuming we like what we see. But our new generation of reddit users begrudge artists even that little price, snatching even those paltry crumbs from their mouths. \n\nAnd the worst part of it is, when confronted about this, they claim that their selfish behaviour is not immoral, that morality does not *extend so far*, that it's okay to steal other peoples' stuff because it's not like artists are people deserving of even the most basic courtesy, and the reader's own convenience is the only consideration in deciding whether to steal something.\n\nThis is why we have to have a rule in the sidebar saying \"Don't re-host other peoples' comics\". In any normal society, that would not have to be spelled out. It would be obvious, common courtesy. It would be unthinkable that it could be otherwise.\n\nNot here, though. Here, even common courtesy is uncommon, and because of it, we have to tell people that they ought not to screw over the very artists whose works are the only reason we come to this subreddit.

Is your putative new language entirely divorced from all languages which preceded it, or will it have pieces taken from C?\n\n&gt; Secondly many of those languages aren't use today. I don't hear about new projects being written in Modula and Pascal\n\nHow hard did you look? \n\n * http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_Applications/Projects_Gallery\n * http://wiki.freepascal.org/Projects_using_Lazarus\n\nNot to mention what is being done in Delphi.\n\n&gt; I seen benchmarks for half of the languages you claim but only half. When I talk about speed I'm talking about no slower than 1.75x. Fortan is occasional 2x or more slower according to these benchmarks. OCaml is mostly 2x+ slower. \"Not slow\" and \"fast\" are different things\n\nOccasionally slower? There are benchmarks showing that Fortran is [in most cases faster than C since it does not suffer from the most egregiously bad design decisions of C](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/60386). There's a reason why, when it comes to raw numerical number crunching, Fortran is still the language of choice. Similarly, [Ocaml is as fast or nearly as fast as C in many benchmarks](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fa.caml/wvykzJ5C140[1-25-false]). It depends entirely on a whole host of factors including the libraries used, the compiler, and the machine on which the benchmarks were run.\n\nSo your dismissal of these languages is just you making excuses. Right now, Ada is both fast enough and safe enough to be used to [fly aeroplanes, control trains, and put satellites into orbit](http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~mfeldman/ada-project-summary.html). Right now, there are operating systems, that is, kernels, not user-space programs, written in [Oberon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebottle_OS), [Modula-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPIN_%28operating_system%29), and [Free Pascal](http://wiki.freepascal.org/Operating_Systems_written_in_FPC). \n\nEiffel use: http://archive.eiffel.com/eiffel/projects/page.html\n\nGo is fast enough and efficient enough for Google to use it for processing petabytes of data. \n\nRemind me again what problem you want to solve that the languages above can't handle.\n\n&gt; being forced to have all your if statements compared to a value known at compile time (which you said in a previous post) is ridiculous.\n\nDo you even understand what types in programming languages are? Do you not understand that if there is a type, either user defined or built-in, then it is the compiler's job to ensure that no expression using that type has values that are outside the range of allowed values for that type? That is the whole point of types, that the compiler checks them at compile time to ensure correctness. Ada's case statements are an example of the compiler ensuring correctness by not allowing gaps. In the language proposed in the original submission we are told that the compiler does not check cases at compile time, indicating that it will allow absurd code like the comparison of an unsigned integer with -5 without warning. No programming language where the designer had even the most elementary idea of language safety would consider allowing such absurdity.\n\n&gt; I think you disagree with me because our definitions of fast are different\n\nI disagree with you because you are making absurd arguments based on hand-wavy notions of speed which seems to be founded on a total ignorance of the state of computer science as it stands today. I've shown you numerous programming languages in existence today which can easily handle any programs you need to write no matter how fast they need to run or how strict the reliability requirements. Free compilers for all of these languages are out there right now. But still you are defending this ludicrous language proposal in the belief that throwing money at some unknown person making silly promises on the internet is a more viable option than using the languages and tools that already exist. \n\n&gt; and because you thought the \"if switch\" statement was the switch statement\n\nIf so, that is due to the indiegogo page being written by an illiterate moron whose grasp of English grammar is as tenuous as his understanding of programming languages.\n", "edited": 1386460696.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First of all half of the languages you mentioned are sub/super sets of eachother&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So? Is your putative new language entirely divorced from all languages which preceded it, or will it have pieces taken from C?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Secondly many of those languages aren&amp;#39;t use today. I don&amp;#39;t hear about new projects being written in Modula and Pascal&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How hard did you look? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_Applications/Projects_Gallery\"&gt;http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPC_Applications/Projects_Gallery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://wiki.freepascal.org/Projects_using_Lazarus\"&gt;http://wiki.freepascal.org/Projects_using_Lazarus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention what is being done in Delphi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I seen benchmarks for half of the languages you claim but only half. When I talk about speed I&amp;#39;m talking about no slower than 1.75x. Fortan is occasional 2x or more slower according to these benchmarks. OCaml is mostly 2x+ slower. &amp;quot;Not slow&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fast&amp;quot; are different things&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Occasionally slower? There are benchmarks showing that Fortran is &lt;a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/60386\"&gt;in most cases faster than C since it does not suffer from the most egregiously bad design decisions of C&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#39;s a reason why, when it comes to raw numerical number crunching, Fortran is still the language of choice. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/fa.caml/wvykzJ5C140%5B1-25-false%5D\"&gt;Ocaml is as fast or nearly as fast as C in many benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;. It depends entirely on a whole host of factors including the libraries used, the compiler, and the machine on which the benchmarks were run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your dismissal of these languages is just you making excuses.
