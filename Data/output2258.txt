He looked right into my eyes, just grinning, seriously, this guy either wanted to fuck me or eat me.  He was waiting for me to say something, but I was to scared, I didn't know what the fuck was going on (I fronted well though, just looked a him, nodded, and stood there like \"what did you guys want?\").

Astonishinly the place used to be called Mom's Place, I said jokingly, \"hey this is mom's place... slid the drink across the table to him, and said that's a dark n dirty with a twist, or a Cuba...\"  and we both finished \"Libre\" and laughed in unison.  His a whole hearted belly laughed, me more of a sheepish hahahaha.  He then told me to sit down and have a drink, and I said no, I have tons of work to do, and you guys just made me cut all my staff.  He said \"fuck eeeet, let the bitch do it\" and I responded \"that bitch is like my little sister and I need keep you monkeys off her back\" as I back away from the table, courteously nodding and making like I have to hustle back behind the bar and get something done.  He watches me the whole time, and when I get back behind the bar, girl is getting hassled by a couple of guys.
