market to have ever existed in history regulated itself out of existence in a few days because the people who actually understand the modding community collectively flipped their shit until the \"mod market\" was removed.\n\nThe best way to guarantee that few unwanted, low quality mods exist is to have no incentives to churn out repetitive low quality content that rubes who don't know better will waste money or attention or recommendations on - and a world where there are still people who have so much money and so little standards that they will pay 1/60th the cost of a full AAA game for someone else to make a higher resolution reskin for a single piece of armor is one where low-effort content will flourish.\n\nSecondly, while you might not happen to have a system that can run those old games you purchased licenses for, you still have the ability to tinker around with emulation tools and modifications to run them, and if you could find an old computer in the real material world you could definitely install your old games onto it and run them if you wanted to.\n\nThe problem I'm talking about is one where mods that are no longer being maintained *but are still required to use your skyrim save files that you have spent hundreds or thousands of hours in* no longer exist in a state where you can play the game.  If you found out that your games from the mid-90s were designed so that the save files would corrupt themselves irrevocably if the year y2k rolled around as an intentional design feature, you would be right to be mad that someone actually charged you money for the experience of being fucked.\n\nMy point is that mod devs shouldn't involve themselves in a relationship with customers where their experimental and untested releases very well have the potential to permanently destroy their customer's game due to unforeseen consequences of the mod's design *that may be impossible to ever fix*.
