I switched to vegetarian and lost some weight.\n\nThen in February of this year I was violently ill, throwing up, constant issues in the bathroom. In addition to not keeping anything down I lost 20lbs in one week. I didn't have insurance but found a local clinic for free who said ot could be a number of things. I had blood and mucous in my stool as well. A CEA blood draw was taken which can, in some people, be an indicator of cancer.\n\nThey checked a complete blood panel and nothing came back as a red flag. They told me to head to a GI doctor for a colonscopy as I'm not old enough to screen normally (it was 50, it's now 45, I turned 44 this year). They even checked for bacteria and viruses in my gut.\n\nWe all assumed it was some GI ailment like Crohn's or Celiac or even maybe Ulcerative Coilitis. There are so many things that can be a source of symptoms.\n\nI was able to get in touch with a counselor at the Colorectal Cancer Alliance and was lucky to qualify for a grant from Blue Hope Nation and went to IL for a colonscopy. By the time I got there first part of June between the \"cleanse\" and the unholy pain in my gut I hadn't eaten solids in 6-8 weeks and was down to eating between eating once every 1-3 days.\n\nI was supposed to get an endoscopy too, suggested, but the grant didn't cover that and I couldn't afford it.\n\nI got it June 8th and they found a mass in my sigmoid colon, he assumed I knew I had cancer so the delivery was ridiculous and like a bombshell to me, but he said the appearance was stage 3 or 4 and I needed surgery. The doctor didn't even want me to wait for the biopsy to talk to a surgeon.\n\nFast forward and I had my sigmoid colon, part of my rectum and 30+ lymph nodes that were in the area that looked \"suspicious\" checked after a ton of pre surgery blood work and CT scans.\n\nIt was not as simple or straight forward as it seems from my post but the things that helped me were keeping track of my symptoms on a dollar store calendar, wrote my sick vs normal days. I started keeping track of if/what I ate etc.\n\nI had to advocate, argue and even change GI doctors to finally be heard.\n\nThat being said, GI or cancer, there are communities here online for you.\n\nJust from your symptoms I'm SO glad you're getting checked. I would reach out to the CCA if you need anything during this journey at all. Especially if you do end up with a cancer diagnosis.\n\nBut while I was scared before diagnosis they helped and even have insurance specific help available to sort through that mess.\n\nI am hoping you get the best possible answer for you. \ud83d\udc99\n\nI'd also keep advocating for yourself and your care! Regardless of your past or how rough your life has been you are a human and DESERVE basic human decency at minimum and most definitely adequate and proper care!! Sometimes during a journey like thus even without a rough life you have to advocate hard for yourself and demand to be heard. I had a doctor literally tell me the blood I saw in my stool was probably just \"period blood\" and I was mistaken.\n\nI know being your own voice is tiring and the prep REALLY sucks, but it's a necessary evil.\n\nPlease let us know how your next attempt goes! If you need anything I can share my experiences with you anytime and give you the resources I've found through this journey myself.\n\nBest of luck!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had some intestinal/GI issues last year causing me to believe I developed an allergy to meat.

They told me to head to a GI doctor for a colonscopy as I&amp;#39;m not old enough to screen normally (it was 50, it&amp;#39;s now 45, I turned 44 this year). They even checked for bacteria and viruses in my gut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all assumed it was some GI ailment like Crohn&amp;#39;s or Celiac or even maybe Ulcerative Coilitis. There are so many things that can be a source of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was able to get in touch with a counselor at the Colorectal Cancer Alliance and was lucky to qualify for a grant from Blue Hope Nation and went to IL for a colonscopy. By the time I got there first part of June between the &amp;quot;cleanse&amp;quot; and the unholy pain in my gut I hadn&amp;#39;t eaten solids in 6-8 weeks and was down to eating between eating once every 1-3 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to get an endoscopy too, suggested, but the grant didn&amp;#39;t cover that and I couldn&amp;#39;t afford it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got it June 8th and they found a mass in my sigmoid colon, he assumed I knew I had cancer so the delivery was ridiculous and like a bombshell to me, but he said the appearance was stage 3 or 4 and I needed surgery. The doctor didn&amp;#39;t even want me to wait for the biopsy to talk to a surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward and I had my sigmoid colon, part of my rectum and 30+ lymph nodes that were in the area that looked &amp;quot;suspicious&amp;quot; checked after a ton of pre surgery blood work and CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was not as simple or straight forward as it seems from my post but the things that helped me were keeping track of my symptoms on a dollar store calendar, wrote my sick vs normal days. I started keeping track of if/what I ate etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to advocate, argue and even change GI doctors to finally be heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, GI or cancer, there are communities here online for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just from your symptoms I&amp;#39;m SO glad you&amp;#39;re getting checked. I would reach out to the CCA if you need anything during this journey at all. Especially if you do end up with a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But while I was scared before diagnosis they helped and even have insurance specific help available to sort through that mess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am hoping you get the best possible answer for you. \ud83d\udc99&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also keep advocating for yourself and your care! Regardless of your past or how rough your life has been you are a human and DESERVE basic human decency at minimum and most definitely adequate and proper care!! Sometimes during a journey like thus even without a rough life you have to advocate hard for yourself and demand to be heard. I had a doctor literally tell me the blood I saw in my stool was probably just &amp;quot;period blood&amp;quot; and I was mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know being your own voice is tiring and the prep REALLY sucks, but it&amp;#39;s a necessary evil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please let us know how your next attempt goes! If you need anything I can share my experiences with you anytime and give you the resources I&amp;#39;ve found through this journey myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_qhvaqe", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/colorectalcancer/comments/qhvaqe/very_worried_feedback_appreciated/hkqkge0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/colorectalcancer/comments/qhvaqe/very_worried_feedback_appreciated/", "name": "t1_hkqkge0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/colorectalcancer", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1636994874.0, "created_utc": 1636994874.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/colorectalcancer/comments/qhvaqe/very_worried_feedback_appreciated/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rmaw", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Just got P90X, any advice before i begin?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "P90X", "link_author": "elonc", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c1r1wtq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "gmrgrrl", "num_comments": 24, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_gwysx", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4816p", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Find an accountability partner, either here or on teambeachbody in the forums.\n\nModify, until you don't have to.
