Because these things very rarely stay dormant and all it takes a major life event or big bout of stress to send a minor disorder into a full blown break and if you don't know what's happening to you or how to deal with it on the most basic level that is so much harder to endure and get through.\n\nWhile therapy does not work for everything it is a very wonderful resource, but is often expensive or hard to get access to. Many disorders now have a myriad of effective drugs available that help manage the symptoms. I have a friend in the UK who was diagnosed with BPD two years ago and once she started meds it did make a big difference for her. I personally, have ADHD and depression. I use CBT to manage my depression but my ADHD is managed by a drug called Concerta, that drug is what makes me function as a human being.\n\n\nMy roommate has recently been going through the arduous process of finding the right drug for her. She was previously diagnosed with depression since her teens only for her to go through a break around Christmas and for her to find out it wasn't depression she had actually, but grand OCD. Since Christmas they have been trying different drugs to find what works for her and about a month ago they put on this new drug and I have never seen her healthier. This is why these things should be caught as early as possible so they can be monitored and prevented from turning into a full blown crisis, or that if they do go into a crisis, you will be better prepared to deal with it and will be able to recover faster. \n\nThis is also why it's so important to get a proper diagnosis. My roommate and I both were so surprised how similar many of the symptoms are between ADHD and grand OCD, but while the symptoms often present in a very similar fashion the reasons behind them are polar opposites. Whereas I feel more comfortable with clear cut rules, guidelines and structures, she feels suffocated by them (this is specific example of our specific disorders, these things may vary from person to person). My meds are stimulants and hers are downers. Her drugs would likely send me into a deep depression, where mine would send her into an anxiety driven, self destructive manic.\n\nWe both were also previously diagnosed with depression. Both of our disorders very commonly come with secondary disorders (with ADHD there's an 80% chance you'll have a second disorder and a 50% chance you will have a third) most commonly anxiety and/or depression. While the day to day impacts of my undiagnosed ADHD weren't life shattering: I was able to hold a job, live relatively healthy, accomplish things from time to time. The true impact wasn't visible until I was medicated and healthy, and for me it revealed that I had allowed myself to live in an abusive relationship for 5 years, because I couldn't trust my memory or brain. \n\n\nPeople do not take mental health serious enough. If you had a persistent rash on your side, you would go and get it checked out eventually, but so many people hide the fact they can't focus, or ignore that they always feel like death is looming over them. The impacts are so subtle and build up so slowly that we don't realize how much weight we're carrying every single day just to get through the day. If this is causing interference in your life, preventing you from doing things or building relationships or advancing in your school or career, please pursue a diagnosis. If, for now it is a minor annoyance there are a ton of resources online that you can read to help teach you coping mechanisms like mindfulness and CBT, but always keep an eye on it and be critical of your actions and feelings, make sure you know where their coming from or if they start to change in unexpected ways.\n\nBest of luck &lt;3", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;depends on your country and your access to mental health resources.
