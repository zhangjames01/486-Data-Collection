Burnham, as a teenager and in his very young adulthood, said some very objectionable things. He made jokes that were unkind and problematic, to be generous.\n\nShane Dawson is also someone who has done a lot of problematic things. He is, among other things, a businessman and content creator who also got his start on Vine and YouTube. Shame Dawson\u2019s career is not doing too well. His public image is very damaged, and he would need a lot of work to repair it. Bo Burnham\u2019s image is generally very positive - he tends to exemplify the concept of growing up and leaving your problematic views behind you.\n\nWhat is the difference between these two people, and how do they relate to people such as Bill Maher or Alexi McCammond?\n\nBo Burnham has consistently and over a period of several years taken initiative to condemn his early work. He originally, in 2009 (when he was 19), argued that his satire was just too deep, bro, but he didn\u2019t keep that up for long. There are numerous clips on the internet of him owning up to his mistakes and he has a general disposition of being apologetic and empathetic with people who decide to sideline him because of his earlier work.\n\nShane Dawson was not proactive in any way with his apologies. Dawson had a character that appeared in multiple videos of his that was performed with blackface. He didn\u2019t admit that this was wrong - he waited for it to become an issue. There were a multitude of other problematic videos that surfaced as well, and not only did he parry these shots as they came instead of saying \u201cyou\u2019re not gonna like what else you\u2019re about to find\u201d, he continued, as an adult, doing fully horrible things and working and collaborating with problematic and terrible people.\n\nShane Dawson and Bill Maher are similar people in the respect that they hide behind the mask of comedy to be who they really are. You may say that in context, Bill Maher is not really transphobic. I vehemently disagree. Bill Maher, in context, sounds plenty transphobic to me, and while the crux of entertainment is definitely to make people feel something about you, even if it\u2019s negative, he has a really scummy way of doing it. He uses current events and social attitudes to target people who are already hurting, and if we\u2019re as generous as can be, he plays devil\u2019s advocate. The devil has plenty of advocates, Bill. He doesn\u2019t need you.\n\nYou also say that because Maher is a liberal, liberals should stick together with him. I can\u2019t disagree more. This is GOP behavior, and for what? A washed-up comic turned unrespectable pundit? How and what do we gain from sticking with him? If he were President, or a major cultural figure, I could see your reasoning, but I don\u2019t here.\n\nOne last stop about ageism: is it a problem? Yes. However, it\u2019s understandable, the ire against the old. Baby Boomers were handed a world full of possibilities, and against all odds, they thoroughly destroyed it. Regulation, culture, politics, human rights, all of the things you do or will care about have been made measurably and immeasurably worse by Boomers and their asinine or evil deeds. So many things that are wrong today can be directly traced to a Boomer deciding to do it or allowing it to continue. They had so much power, so much freedom, so much life. They will not pass that on. They got their fill and many of us will starve or work ourselves to death to get a shadow of their life\u2019s meal. \n\nI almost forgot, Alexi McCammond: she wasn\u2019t joking.

Burnham, as a teenager and in his very young adulthood, said some very objectionable things. He made jokes that were unkind and problematic, to be generous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shane Dawson is also someone who has done a lot of problematic things. He is, among other things, a businessman and content creator who also got his start on Vine and YouTube. Shame Dawson\u2019s career is not doing too well. His public image is very damaged, and he would need a lot of work to repair it. Bo Burnham\u2019s image is generally very positive - he tends to exemplify the concept of growing up and leaving your problematic views behind you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between these two people, and how do they relate to people such as Bill Maher or Alexi McCammond?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bo Burnham has consistently and over a period of several years taken initiative to condemn his early work. He originally, in 2009 (when he was 19), argued that his satire was just too deep, bro, but he didn\u2019t keep that up for long. There are numerous clips on the internet of him owning up to his mistakes and he has a general disposition of being apologetic and empathetic with people who decide to sideline him because of his earlier work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shane Dawson was not proactive in any way with his apologies. Dawson had a character that appeared in multiple videos of his that was performed with blackface. He didn\u2019t admit that this was wrong - he waited for it to become an issue. There were a multitude of other problematic videos that surfaced as well, and not only did he parry these shots as they came instead of saying \u201cyou\u2019re not gonna like what else you\u2019re about to find\u201d, he continued, as an adult, doing fully horrible things and working and collaborating with problematic and terrible people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shane Dawson and Bill Maher are similar people in the respect that they hide behind the mask of comedy to be who they really are. You may say that in context, Bill Maher is not really transphobic. I vehemently disagree. Bill Maher, in context, sounds plenty transphobic to me, and while the crux of entertainment is definitely to make people feel something about you, even if it\u2019s negative, he has a really scummy way of doing it.

Marx himself said he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how it would work, and he theorized a number of things, like not having money or property and possibly not having a state. The thing about Marxism (or communism: the original series) is that it spawned from Marx observing capitalism and its evils and misdeeds, and the misery it created, and he theorized that there must exist an opposite to that. That\u2019s where his suggestions against money, property, and the state come from - he watched them used as levers of control and surmised that if there were a society where those didn\u2019t exist, people couldn\u2019t be controlled by them.\n\nLenin, Stalin, and Trotsky came along later. Decades later, in fact. Mao also made his own theories on communist thought, and he also was decades after Marx and Engels did any pondering about it. As a matter of fact, none of the people I just named other than Marx and Engels would come of age and importance until the 1910s and 1920s at the earliest, roughly a generation after the last volume of Das Kapital in 1883. \n\nOther than Trotsky, whose name later became a pejorative, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao all have their own monikers for their beliefs (Leninism, Stalinism, and Maoism, respectively) because those beliefs are so different and sometimes contradictory to Marxist ideology. Lenin believed that a state must be socialist before it could be communist, as a way of preparing the people for a different way of life. He also espoused accelerationism, the idea that leftists should try to bring about or champion causes that would accelerate the downfall of capitalism. Marx didn\u2019t believe this. Marxists today do not believe this. Leninists and Maoists do, but again, there\u2019s a good reason that there are terms other than communist to describe them.\n\nStalin advanced a set of policies known as Stalinism. These policies essentially revolve around his cult of personality and ensuring that spheres of power and influence revolved around him. While self-styled as a communist throughout his life, very little about Stalin actually reflected advancement of communist goals or ideology, taking many of his principles from Leninist thought. He mostly served himself. Because of this, Stalin is referred to as and is the namesake of Stalinism. \n\nMao is perhaps the most faithful to Marxist ideology, but adapted Marxist thought to pre-Industrial China. Like Stalin, Mao also borrowed heavily from Leninist philosophy, in the form of enacting a socialist revolution in China spearheaded by the peasantry. Again, Marx did not espouse the need for socialism in a formal sense at all. It was Lenin, a Bolshevik socialist himself, who appended this idea onto Marxist thought.\n\nWhat\u2019s super duper funny is that you ascribe the crimes performed in the name of communism to all communists. The Crusades were performed in the name of God. Are then the Crusades the fault of Baptists? Baptists claim to serve God. The perpetrators of the Crusades claimed to serve God. So, by your logic, Baptists are responsible for the Crusades. See how that sounds fucking stupid?\n\nNot all who call themselves Communist are actually communist in the original sense. A Leninist, a Stalinist, a Maoist, let them answer for those crimes. The Soviet Union was a state capitalist enterprise that served Stalin, not the people. Lenin was a socialist who thought Marxism didn\u2019t go far enough. Mao was an authoritarian mother-knows-best figure; his actions during the Great Leap Forward do not reflect communist ideals or even sensible practice in general.

Like Stalin, Mao also borrowed heavily from Leninist philosophy, in the form of enacting a socialist revolution in China spearheaded by the peasantry. Again, Marx did not espouse the need for socialism in a formal sense at all. It was Lenin, a Bolshevik socialist himself, who appended this idea onto Marxist thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s super duper funny is that you ascribe the crimes performed in the name of communism to all communists. The Crusades were performed in the name of God. Are then the Crusades the fault of Baptists? Baptists claim to serve God. The perpetrators of the Crusades claimed to serve God. So, by your logic, Baptists are responsible for the Crusades. See how that sounds fucking stupid?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not all who call themselves Communist are actually communist in the original sense. A Leninist, a Stalinist, a Maoist, let them answer for those crimes. The Soviet Union was a state capitalist enterprise that served Stalin, not the people. Lenin was a socialist who thought Marxism didn\u2019t go far enough. Mao was an authoritarian mother-knows-best figure; his actions during the Great Leap Forward do not reflect communist ideals or even sensible practice in general. Whatever good that may have been produced from his philosophies is certainly overshadowed by the tens of millions of Chinese needlessly starved by his administrative tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11prfhn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskALiberal/comments/11prfhn/why_should_i_have_to_give_up_my_ar15/jc0mo4s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/11prfhn/why_should_i_have_to_give_up_my_ar15/", "name": "t1_jc0mo4s", "author_flair_template_id": "1b709eb0-3ba6-11e7-a7c8-0eb01a27c608", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskALiberal", "author_flair_text": "Anarcho-Communist", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678680304.0, "created_utc": 1678680304.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/11prfhn/why_should_i_have_to_give_up_my_ar15/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ukxe", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Why should I have to give up my AR-15?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskALiberal", "link_author": "BillRoadhouse", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jc0ijgt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Seefufiat", "num_comments": 586, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jc0h9wp", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_ag6pf", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yeah, that one.
