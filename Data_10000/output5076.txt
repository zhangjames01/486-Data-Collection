Do you want want the government to do so just because it\u2019s minor children? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If so, maybe start with the fact most states don\u2019t have strict requirements for minors seeking cosmetic procedures outside of \u201cparental consent.\u201d A 15 year old can get a nose job, chin shaved, hairline augmented, breast size increased and have facial hair lasered off &lt;em&gt;just because it\u2019s a trend&lt;/em&gt; to look that way, and all their parents have to do is say \u201cok,\u201d sign some paperwork and find a doctor. Meanwhile, if that same 15 year old, under the guidance of mental health professionals and a team of doctors, needed the same types of procedures under the label of gender affirming care, that\u2019s somehow a problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teens in the entertainment industry get various cosmetic procedures routinely yet we don\u2019t have members of Congress or state legislatures stepping up concerned about that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re falling for the typical propaganda of \u201cthink of the children!\u201d There are no legitimate doctors out there performing irreversible (or difficult to reverse) gender affirming care for &lt;em&gt;anyone,&lt;/em&gt; minor or adult, without vast documentation from other reputable medical professionals. Unethical doctors will perform procedures, law or no law.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10pvxha", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/10pvxha/cmv_many_children_will_regret_their_transgender/j6mzpsl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/10pvxha/cmv_many_children_will_regret_their_transgender/", "name": "t1_j6mzpsl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "author_flair_text": "4\u2206", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675174388.0, "created_utc": 1675174388.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/10pvxha/cmv_many_children_will_regret_their_transgender/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "A 45-year-old biotech CEO may have reduced his biological age by at least 5 years through a rigorous medical program that can cost up to $2 million a year, Bloomberg reported", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "technology", "link_author": "777fer", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5zbtgu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "xtlou", "num_comments": 2636, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j5x7sab", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_7vjhv", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Never doubt the power of ego, body dysmorphia, orthorexia, steroids, the money to buy \u201cyes\u201d people, and a lace front wig.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never doubt the power of ego, body dysmorphia, orthorexia, steroids, the money to buy \u201cyes\u201d people, and a lace front wig.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10lihx2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/10lihx2/a_45yearold_biotech_ceo_may_have_reduced_his/j5zbtgu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/10lihx2/a_45yearold_biotech_ceo_may_have_reduced_his/", "name": "t1_j5zbtgu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1674751697.0, "created_utc": 1674751697.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://businessinsider.com/bryan-johnson-45-reduced-biological-age-5-years-project-blueprint-2023-1"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3r", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The Great Molasses Flood, Boston, 15 January 1919", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "boston", "link_author": "arch_llama", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5xa9bc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "xtlou", "num_comments": 47, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j5wv9gm", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_7vjhv", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah yes, not melted, I misremembered.
