A drunk Korean student was trying to coax a foreigner to fight outside the bar. I knew the Korean was drunk because he was super red, droopy eyes, and couldn't stand up straight, while the foreigner was fine as he was very articulate and his movement was not one of someone who was drunk. This time a lot of bystanders (mostly Korean) were holding the two guys back. But they weren't doing anything to calm both sides down. So I went up to the foreigner because in my mind it would be better to calm the sober one and tell him to walk away rather than try to convince a really drunk person. I told the guy \"Hey, this isn't worth it and sorry that you have to put up with things like these, but  it would be best to just go back inside and enjoy the rest of the night.\" Luckily, it got through to him and he went back in. What irked me the most is that one of the bystanders came up to me and kind of pushed me aside telling me that I don't know shit about the Korean law and blah blah. It was funny because while he was Korean, he spoke in a very fluent English accent, he looked really young, and his fashion was different from the current trends in Korea, so I feel like he hasn't been in Korea as long as I have. It sounded like he wanted to see the fight, but I just walked away.\n3. Not really a street fight, but I saw a lot of bouncers chase down a guy outside of a club. It was three huge bouncers and they just dog piled this one guy. And then they proceeded to kick him while he was down. A huge crowd gathered and just watched these three huge bouncers kicking on some dude in the fetal position. Once the situation settled, people were saying that the guy who got beat up was stealing wallets and jewelry in the club?
