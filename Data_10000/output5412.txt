The article mentions that the copyright protection was revoked because the work was not created by a human, not because of any accusations of theft. You are clearly ideologically motivated and do not even hesitate to lie or misrepresent.\n\n&gt; you tried to flex an prestigious jargon argumentative fallacy\n\nI didn't, you are simply failing to read this thread of this post. Gradient descent is one of the first and fundamental concepts in machine learning, and anyone that claims to understand it should be able to explain what it means, at least conceptually. You can look up these terms and you should be able to get an intuitive understanding if you would apply yourself for an hour. We were talking about how these AIs work and was mocking the person who claimed that he knew all that he needed to by just looking at Midjourney. That's just plain ridiculous and I was making fun of that. I posted the jargon to 'test' his 'knowledge' about AI that he claimed to have. You failed in reading comprehension and proceeded to attack me on statements that I didn't even make.\n\n&gt; I called you on both the fallacy and just being flat-out wrong, and then you tried to pretend you /s-ed and were \"hur-dur just pretending\" to wiggle your way out.\n\nIf you'd stop frothing at the mouth and attacking me you would see that you were wrong and you're just digging to avoid admitting to yourself that you were a shitty person for no reason. It's not my job to educate you, especially when you posture as if you understand all this stuff and are rude to me for no reason. I'll say it one more time hoping it will penetrate your skull: **I don't care about the copyright discussion**, I'm just calling out people who misrepresent how these models work, like you are. I was telling you to read a paper on how Neural Generative Networks work, not about fucking copyright law. You obviously don't take any effort to actually read and understand my comments.\n\n&gt; And nice job with the bad bad-faith take on my analogy in an attempt to discredit me while bringing back zero rebuttal lol.\n\nThat's because your analogy is stupid and just makes it very clear that you have no idea how this stuff works.\n\n\nLet's go tear it apart for fun:\n\n&gt; We know the images produced can be uncannily similar, and in some cases a near pixel-by-pixel copy in parts. \n\nDo you know this? Have you measured this? You once again claim something and your track record is not very good with all the misrepresenting and lying you did until now.\n\n&gt; And its important to remember that ALL images that exist online are ultimately just code.\n\nEVERYTHING (I can do random caps too) online is stored in a binary format. JPEG is binary, your word document is binary, even the instructions that represent the pixels are stored in a binary format. This is what I meant when I said that you don't even understand the basics of computer files, how can you confidently claim to know how these models work when you don't even understand a jpeg?\n\n&gt; Just because an image is stored as binary, or compressed via a fancy pattern-recognizing algorithm doesn't change the fact it can be converted back into basically the same original image with the right tools.\n\nThat's not a fact. Depending on the transformations, if non-linear transformations are used it is not a 'fact' that you can just turn it back. It's not possible by definition. It's another case if you take linear transformations. Once again you prove that you have no idea how these models learn or work. \n\nIf you actually understood these models or would just think about this you would realize that it would be wildly impractical to actually save parts or the whole image. That would require so much storage and would be very slow. These models actually learn very similarly to humans. Distinct features/patterns are extracted from the training images, it's similar to how human remember faces. You don't have a super detailed photo in your mind, but your brain stores a bunch of patterns instead (distance between eyes, distance between eyes and mouth, eye colour, etc.). These models process the training material in the same way.\n\n&gt; We can see this with the Afghan Girl photo. These programs clearly DO store parts (or even all) of the original work, just behind the veil of \"pattern recognition\".\n\nOnce again you make a 'clear' claim of something that you just are not able to tell by looking at the pictures. The Afghan Girl photo definitely raises the question of the usage of copyrighted works in the training of Midjourney, but in no way proves that the model stores part of the individual work. It might, but this is no proof. A strong clue? Definitely. But it's definitely not proof. Stop misrepresenting things.\n\nNow onto your 'thought(less') experiment, are you still with me? Don't worry, I won't need much time.\n\n&gt; If I wrote a program that took an original painting jpg, converted it to binary\n\nHow the hell can there be a thing like an 'original painting jpg'? That's just stupid. Also a jpeg is binary, this does not make sense and once again shows that you don't even grasp the basics of digital information, who's the one that's just throwing around jargon without any understanding? I don't think that's me.\n\n&gt; randomly swapped a few 1s and 0s, then converted it back into a jpg can I now use it for commercial purposes?\n\nThis is the only smart question is here. Answer: it depends. Andy Warhol could just take a photo of Marilyn Monroe, recolor it four times and collage it. It depends if others find it transformative enough.\n\n&gt;   My program that converts jpgs into binary and back again is based on **pattern recognition of pixel location, color, and strings of 1s and 0s**. \n\nOnce again **you** are throwing out jargon without knowing what it means.\n\n&gt;I'm not storing any \"image data\", so the final output is now legally mine to use as I want right?\n\nNo! you are storing \"image data\", the jpeg *is* image data for God's sake! It is kept in memory, unchanged, until it is stored again. Once again proving that you not only misunderstand this technologically but also philosophically. This is also not how neural generative networks function, so this example is moot.\n\nAre you convinced that you were wrong about how neural generative models work now?\n\n&gt; If you were actually the expert you're pretending to be you'd be able to explain why AI art isn't theft in a way people can actually understand. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not here to talk about copyright or about how these models are theft or not. I'm responding to correct false information on how these models technically work, like the false statements that you keep making.\n\n&gt; All you have is programming jargon and buzzwords to try to confuse people into submission then bail when the debate involves a frontal lobe. Thanks for showing everyone what the pro-AI art community looks like.\n\nLol, are you seriously saying that I'm trying to confuse people because I'm engaging in a discussion that requires a brain? I'm telling you to read a paper on the models (**not copyright law, I DONT CARE**) because you made it very clear that you don't understand how these function. Do you claim to have a frontal lobe because you seem to be terrible at reading comprehension (misrepresenting the subject of my comments and the article) and have no issue blustering about things you clearly know nothing about. You are just showcasing how very intellectually dishonest and lazy you are.

This is also not how neural generative networks function, so this example is moot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you convinced that you were wrong about how neural generative models work now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you were actually the expert you&amp;#39;re pretending to be you&amp;#39;d be able to explain why AI art isn&amp;#39;t theft in a way people can actually understand. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I&amp;#39;m not here to talk about copyright or about how these models are theft or not. I&amp;#39;m responding to correct false information on how these models technically work, like the false statements that you keep making.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All you have is programming jargon and buzzwords to try to confuse people into submission then bail when the debate involves a frontal lobe. Thanks for showing everyone what the pro-AI art community looks like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lol, are you seriously saying that I&amp;#39;m trying to confuse people because I&amp;#39;m engaging in a discussion that requires a brain? I&amp;#39;m telling you to read a paper on the models (&lt;strong&gt;not copyright law, I DONT CARE&lt;/strong&gt;) because you made it very clear that you don&amp;#39;t understand how these function. Do you claim to have a frontal lobe because you seem to be terrible at reading comprehension (misrepresenting the subject of my comments and the article) and have no issue blustering about things you clearly know nothing about. You are just showcasing how very intellectually dishonest and lazy you are. Guess the &amp;quot;pro-AI art community&amp;quot;, which I have never claimed to support or be a part of, seems to be more of my gang as I hate people that lie or throw jargon without any understanding because they are ideologically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_ztfe2h", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Futurology/comments/ztfe2h/aicreated_comic_has_been_deemed_ineligible_for/j1hisgk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ztfe2h/aicreated_comic_has_been_deemed_ineligible_for/", "name": "t1_j1hisgk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Futurology", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1671882206.0, "created_utc": 1671882206.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.cbr.com/ai-comic-deemed-ineligible-copyright-protection/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t7no", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "AI-Created Comic Has Been Deemed Ineligible for Copyright Protection", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Futurology", "link_author": "__The__Anomaly__", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j1gbpkk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Maxiflex", "num_comments": 2636, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j1fs0iv", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_53p8v", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; Confused about what you mean on first part, so I'll give benefit of doubt that I misunderstood something.\n\nI too was confused by your first comment in which you attacked me for no reason.
