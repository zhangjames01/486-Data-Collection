How is the internet what it is (i hope that begs no explanation)? How has Americas Funniest Home Videos been on since 1989 with high ratings to this day?\n\nUmmmm... people love laughing at other people. \nPeople are addicted to gossip and finding out details from other people's situations.\n\nPaying to have legislation customized to keeping a scenario private by the judiciary that was truly public only reflects the input of a few people to 'protect' her from the consequences of her actions, which are natural and only prevented due to how embarrassing her fuckup was. In general, the law does not exist to protect people from their embarrassing fuckups. People are riduculed in life all the time for various reasons by various size and proximity groups. Shitting yourself in public is a pretty good reason to laugh at someone compared to the things I've seen in life, like a girl who was tormented for having tuna for lunch every day. She had very few friends, cried every day repeatedly, and nobody had the confidence to help her, at the ages of 8-12 that I knew her. Her daily life was to walk through halls of ridicule and bullying that every student and teacher enabled.\n\nI'd think about these questions, and then ask why is it different in each scenario?\n\nCan she invoke legislation to protect herself at elementary school against bullying?\n\nIs the cause for concern similar to that of the embarrassed poop girl?\n\nIs the potential damage to her character development similar to that of the poop girl?\n\nHow acute is the concern for her well-being? Does every person around her know of the 'stigma'?\n\nHow much time does she spend in an environment similar to that which generates the stigma?\n\nHow much can she affect the existence of the stigma? Can she (have) change(d) her behavior to prevent it? Should she (have)?\n\nThen, if you're a liberal, you'd probably conclude that we need to develop custom legislation and protection system for every child who ever felt bullied.... and we should pay for it through taxes, YAY!!\n\nI, on the other hand, conclude that life is hard and people should be better to people in every small situation (like smelling someone's tuna at lunch and not ridiculing them for years). Beyond that, you have to deal with the consequences of your actions, and sometimes, life is not only hard but unfair. Thats why you should laugh at yourself and everyone else, at every opportunity. If you start complaining or protecting idiots for dumb reasons, too bad nobody gives a shit about your story because it's hard for them too.", "edited": 1384973881.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d confidently estimate that most people disagree with you, whether or not they voice it. How is the internet what it is (i hope that begs no explanation)? How has Americas Funniest Home Videos been on since 1989 with high ratings to this day?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ummmm... people love laughing at other people. \nPeople are addicted to gossip and finding out details from other people&amp;#39;s situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paying to have legislation customized to keeping a scenario private by the judiciary that was truly public only reflects the input of a few people to &amp;#39;protect&amp;#39; her from the consequences of her actions, which are natural and only prevented due to how embarrassing her fuckup was. In general, the law does not exist to protect people from their embarrassing fuckups. People are riduculed in life all the time for various reasons by various size and proximity groups. Shitting yourself in public is a pretty good reason to laugh at someone compared to the things I&amp;#39;ve seen in life, like a girl who was tormented for having tuna for lunch every day. She had very few friends, cried every day repeatedly, and nobody had the confidence to help her, at the ages of 8-12 that I knew her. Her daily life was to walk through halls of ridicule and bullying that every student and teacher enabled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d think about these questions, and then ask why is it different in each scenario?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can she invoke legislation to protect herself at elementary school against bullying?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the cause for concern similar to that of the embarrassed poop girl?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is the potential damage to her character development similar to that of the poop girl?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How acute is the concern for her well-being? Does every person around her know of the &amp;#39;stigma&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much time does she spend in an environment similar to that which generates the stigma?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much can she affect the existence of the stigma? Can she (have) change(d) her behavior to prevent it? Should she (have)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, if you&amp;#39;re a liberal, you&amp;#39;d probably conclude that we need to develop custom legislation and protection system for every child who ever felt bullied.... and we should pay for it through taxes, YAY!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I, on the other hand, conclude that life is hard and people should be better to people in every small situation (like smelling someone&amp;#39;s tuna at lunch and not ridiculing them for years). Beyond that, you have to deal with the consequences of your actions, and sometimes, life is not only hard but unfair. Thats why you should laugh at yourself and everyone else, at every opportunity.
