So I'd like to clear that up because I think it'll give you a better idea of the big picture here.\n\nFor the record I'm almost 40 and just started hrt a little while ago. However, I've been aware of my being trans since I was much younger. I was about 13 or so when I figured out I was different. I was 16 or 17 when I figured out \"different\" meant being trans. But back then there wasn't anything to do about it so I did my best to ignore it and carry on. I did, but I basically thought about killing myself every day for 20 years. Came close a few times too. Finally decided to transition a few years back and I had a thought. What if I had done this when I was younger? You know I don't hate myself or the way I look any more. I don't want to die any more. I could have done this more than 20 years ago, and my life probably would have been much different. Happier. More fulfilled.\n\nKids these days have that chance. They can transition while they're still in their teens. But the people crowing about it try to make it seem like these kids are doing it on their own. Like they just up and walk into a planned parenthood one day and ask for meds at the drop of a hat, even when they're still little. It ain't like that at all though. A kid figures out they're trans, they go talk to their parents about it. Then they talk to a therapist. They socially transition first if they're too young for puberty. Then when they get to the age of puberty they go talk to an endocrinologist and get put on puberty blockers. And they stay on em until they're older. Maybe 15 or 16 or so. If that time rolls around and after all that the kid still says they're trans then they get hrt. Understand. Little kids ain't getting hrt like you thought. It ain't like that. It's controlled and watched the whole time by the kid and their parents and the doctors and therapists. It's safe. Hell, they don't even do surgeries until 18 except for real rare cases.\n\nLaw makers now are trying to end all that though. They don't want anyone anywhere to transition before 18, and some places are passing laws to stop it until after 26. Remember that most trans people face thoughts of suicide from having to deal with their gender dysphoria. A fair number of them actually try and do it. Too many succeed. All because they can't get the care and support they needed.\n\nYou made it to 22. Could you make it to 27? How about 38 like I did? I came *real* close a fair few number of times to ending it.

They can transition while they&amp;#39;re still in their teens. But the people crowing about it try to make it seem like these kids are doing it on their own. Like they just up and walk into a planned parenthood one day and ask for meds at the drop of a hat, even when they&amp;#39;re still little. It ain&amp;#39;t like that at all though. A kid figures out they&amp;#39;re trans, they go talk to their parents about it. Then they talk to a therapist. They socially transition first if they&amp;#39;re too young for puberty. Then when they get to the age of puberty they go talk to an endocrinologist and get put on puberty blockers. And they stay on em until they&amp;#39;re older. Maybe 15 or 16 or so. If that time rolls around and after all that the kid still says they&amp;#39;re trans then they get hrt. Understand. Little kids ain&amp;#39;t getting hrt like you thought. It ain&amp;#39;t like that. It&amp;#39;s controlled and watched the whole time by the kid and their parents and the doctors and therapists. It&amp;#39;s safe. Hell, they don&amp;#39;t even do surgeries until 18 except for real rare cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Law makers now are trying to end all that though. They don&amp;#39;t want anyone anywhere to transition before 18, and some places are passing laws to stop it until after 26. Remember that most trans people face thoughts of suicide from having to deal with their gender dysphoria. A fair number of them actually try and do it. Too many succeed. All because they can&amp;#39;t get the care and support they needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You made it to 22. Could you make it to 27? How about 38 like I did? I came &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; close a fair few number of times to ending it. You really wanna put that on these kids? It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11tbq9s", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/transgender/comments/11tbq9s/at_11th_hour_kentucky_republicans_resurrect/jcjqkwi/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/transgender/comments/11tbq9s/at_11th_hour_kentucky_republicans_resurrect/", "name": "t1_jcjqkwi", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/transgender", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679047744.0, "created_utc": 1679047744.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/16/at-11th-hour-kentucky-republicans-resurrect-and-rush-anti-trans-bill/70016887007/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3e7kl", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Can we please make this subreddit private?
