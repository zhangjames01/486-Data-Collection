I was there September - December, in Glasgow. A few things I learned:\n\n1. Rainboots, obviously, are a good thing. But good walking boots (i.e., waterproof hiking boots) are also a good idea, because the ground gets super icy in the winter and if you want to go hill walking or anything, wellies won't cut it.\n\n2. A warm coat. You'll want a waterproof/windproof jacket for sure, but if you're there in the winter you'll also want a proper winter coat. I ended up having to buy one; it doesn't hold up to North American levels of cold (40 below, Celsius, woo!), but it's great for late fall/early spring here.\n\n3. LAYERS! I know this seems obvious, but I was surprised by how much layering I did. It doesn't get super cold, by North American standards (I don't think it even got much below zero Celsius while I was there), but you have to account for the persistent damp and cold wind. Also any building you go into will be sweltering hot, so you'll need to be able to basically strip down to a tee shirt or tank top to not melt. When I knew I was going to be spending most of my time outside, I found long-sleeve shirts from Lululemon to be an excellent base layer (though I suppose any product from a similar retailer would work). \n\n3. Ear muffs! Seriously, this did not occur to me. I took toques, because I am Canadian and from Alberta and that is how we roll. But it was rarely cold enough for a toque, but the wind was cold enough in November/December that I always wanted something to cover my ears when I was walking outside.\n\n4. Remember that dryers are not common. You might have access to one if you're living in uni residence, but I got a flatshare, and did not have a dryer. So pack with attention to having to hang EVERYTHING to dry. Including socks and underwear and pyjamas. I ended up buying extras of all of those things once I was there, because it was a rare thing to have everything dry when you needed it after a load of laundry.\n\n5. This should be obvious, but: Don't overpack. I didn't wear almost 3/4 of the things I took with me, because they weren't well-suited to the climate. I'd recommend instead fitting some space in your budget to buy some stuff once you're there. There's the obvious climate reason for this, but also the fact that Scottish fashion is quite different to North American fashion (or, I think, fashion elsewhere) and chances are you're going to want to do the thing right and pick up a couple of trends.\n\nTL;DR: Basically if you live in the Pacific Northwest your wardrobe should be perfect.\n\n*Edited to add: Feel free to PM me if you've any other questions :)", "edited": 1412638483.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess it depends when you&amp;#39;re going.

I ended up buying extras of all of those things once I was there, because it was a rare thing to have everything dry when you needed it after a load of laundry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should be obvious, but: Don&amp;#39;t overpack. I didn&amp;#39;t wear almost 3/4 of the things I took with me, because they weren&amp;#39;t well-suited to the climate. I&amp;#39;d recommend instead fitting some space in your budget to buy some stuff once you&amp;#39;re there. There&amp;#39;s the obvious climate reason for this, but also the fact that Scottish fashion is quite different to North American fashion (or, I think, fashion elsewhere) and chances are you&amp;#39;re going to want to do the thing right and pick up a couple of trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Basically if you live in the Pacific Northwest your wardrobe should be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*Edited to add: Feel free to PM me if you&amp;#39;ve any other questions :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2id95g", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2id95g/the_ultimate_rain_jacket_thread/cl2byd2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2id95g/the_ultimate_rain_jacket_thread/", "name": "t1_cl2byd2", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/femalefashionadvice", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1412638113.0, "created_utc": 1412638113.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2id95g/the_ultimate_rain_jacket_thread/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Everybody always talks about how awesome random cameos are in films.

I'm actively seeking treatment for the first time in my life - I've struggled with depression since my early teens, am now 25 - but it's a difficult battle. To give you a sense of it:\n\n* **worthlessness:** I'm a successful young woman. Intellectually, I know that. I'm starting a PhD this September, have received oodles of funding and accolades and so on. At the same time, however, I am acutely aware of everything I am *not*, and everything I am not *doing*, or haven't *done*, and in my mind this translates into being an incompetent, useless waste of space human being. There is a clear divide between what I know and how I feel, and the feeling (right now, anyway) outweighs the knowledge.\n\n* **fear:** Will it get better? How long will my friends and family put up with me being this way? Will I be able to hold down a job? Will I make it through my PhD? What will happen if I leave the house today? What will happen if I get out of bed? -- These are the sorts of thoughts that run rampant in my head, though this is by no means an exhaustive list. I hesitate to call them anxieties, because I have an acknowledged anxiety problem, and the feelings that come with these sorts of thoughts are the same sort of heart-pounding fear that comes with encountering my worst phobias (which happen to be spiders and clowns, btw). I talk myself out of bed and into the world each day, or at least as far into it as I can get; sometimes I only make it to the couch, and the way the coffee pot tends to dribble coffee onto the counter when I try to pour it will be enough to make me cry.\n\n* **shame:** Yeah, cue shame. I should be stronger than this, right? Nope. Again, intellectually, I know that what I'm dealing with is a combination of a chemical imbalance and thoughts/feelings that have been exacerbated by that, but I'm smart (or stupid) enough, and probably arrogant enough, to think that I should just be able to power on through and get on with my life. And when I can't make myself get out of bed in the morning, or have to leave the grocery store because it's just too much to try to decide between two brands of orange juice, yeah, there's a lot of shame.\n\n* **frustration and anger:** These go hand in hand for me, and follow from the above. I guess I could tack self-loathing on here, but that for me is less constant than the others. I hit shame, and then I berate myself for the whole situation, and for letting it beat me, and I berate the world for dealing me a shitty hand, and I wonder why the fuck I can't just deal with things like a normal person.\n\n##\n\nAnecdotally, there are two things I think of whenever people talk about depression and how it feels, and how to deal with it. \n\nThe first is from cartoons: Those bits when the character has the little angel and the little devil on his/her shoulder, telling him/her what he/she should do, or not do. Depression is that little devil, whispering all sorts of horrible, awful things about you and the world into your ear, while the angel is tied and gagged in a corner somewhere, trying to get free and rescue you before you do something stupid.\n\nThe second anecdote is from *The Lord of the Rings.* If you've seen the movies or read the books, hopefully you remember the battle for Helm's Deep.

It *can* be effective, but if you're thinking about pursuing it as a treatment option, do some research and find a therapist trained in traditional Chinese medicine. Also be prepared to commit -- it's not a \"one and done\" situation, and depending on what needs treating, it may take several treatments before you begin to notice results.  \n\nCompare my two acupuncture experiences:\n\n**Experience #1:** I have a host of health problems, and several years ago reached a point where I was sick of pumping my body full of chemicals that didn't seem to be doing anything besides masking my symptoms. So I pursued alternative treatment options, with the support of my family physician, who recommended a Chinese medicine clinic in my city. I was sceptical, but agreed to give it a try.\n\nThe initial consult was long, covered my entire health history, and we ended up with a list of problem areas to target. The doctor basically told me that there was no point in just treating the one issue I was most concerned about (Crohn's disease) because the inflammation and other IBD-related business was all tied up with other problems (insomnia, anxiety, arthritis, migraines, etc.). We agreed on a treatment plan with once-weekly, one-hour treatments.\n\nThe next week, I was doing my best Wolverine/porcupine impression, chilling out under heat lamps with some sort of electric current hooked up to some of the needles to help with the energy flow. I had the BEST NAPS on that treatment bed, let me tell you. I didn't notice effects immediately, though by about the third or fourth week, things were... better. Fewer headaches, less belly pain, joints less swollen and tender, better sleep.\n\nI don't blame anyone who yells \"PLACEBO EFFECT!\" on reading this. I worried about that. But I've had enough experience with my body and its reactions to medications that work, and those that don't, to know that at the very least the effects I experienced while receiving acupuncture treatment were on par with, and in some ways better than, the results of medications I've been on for the same problems.\n\n**Experience #2:** I tweaked my knee a few years ago, doc sent me to physio. Cue expected boring knee-strenghtening exercises to do every day, and add unexpected acupuncture. At this point, having had the experience outlined above, I knew what the experience and results should be like. None of that happened.\n\nSee, the whole key to acupuncture (as far as I understand) is actually hitting the points in the body that the needles are meant to activate or release or whatever. And you can **feel it** when the needle hits that point. The closest I can come to describing it is like when a muscle cramps, that moment of \"Oh. My. God. YES. THANK YOU.\" when the cramp/pressure finally lets go. Except this is a cramp you didn't know you had until the needle hits it, and then BAM. You can relax again.\n\nMy proper acupuncturist worked to find those cramp spots; the physiotherapist who gave me acupuncture just sort of stuck the needles in and left me to hang out for a while. That particular part of the treatment had no effect whatsoever on my knee recovery. So.\n\n**TL;DR:** Acupuncture can be effective, but find a proper acupuncturist.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had acupuncture.

So I pursued alternative treatment options, with the support of my family physician, who recommended a Chinese medicine clinic in my city. I was sceptical, but agreed to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The initial consult was long, covered my entire health history, and we ended up with a list of problem areas to target. The doctor basically told me that there was no point in just treating the one issue I was most concerned about (Crohn&amp;#39;s disease) because the inflammation and other IBD-related business was all tied up with other problems (insomnia, anxiety, arthritis, migraines, etc.). We agreed on a treatment plan with once-weekly, one-hour treatments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next week, I was doing my best Wolverine/porcupine impression, chilling out under heat lamps with some sort of electric current hooked up to some of the needles to help with the energy flow. I had the BEST NAPS on that treatment bed, let me tell you. I didn&amp;#39;t notice effects immediately, though by about the third or fourth week, things were... better. Fewer headaches, less belly pain, joints less swollen and tender, better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t blame anyone who yells &amp;quot;PLACEBO EFFECT!&amp;quot; on reading this. I worried about that. But I&amp;#39;ve had enough experience with my body and its reactions to medications that work, and those that don&amp;#39;t, to know that at the very least the effects I experienced while receiving acupuncture treatment were on par with, and in some ways better than, the results of medications I&amp;#39;ve been on for the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience #2:&lt;/strong&gt; I tweaked my knee a few years ago, doc sent me to physio. Cue expected boring knee-strenghtening exercises to do every day, and add unexpected acupuncture. At this point, having had the experience outlined above, I knew what the experience and results should be like. None of that happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, the whole key to acupuncture (as far as I understand) is actually hitting the points in the body that the needles are meant to activate or release or whatever. And you can &lt;strong&gt;feel it&lt;/strong&gt; when the needle hits that point. The closest I can come to describing it is like when a muscle cramps, that moment of &amp;quot;Oh. My. God. YES. THANK YOU.&amp;quot; when the cramp/pressure finally lets go. Except this is a cramp you didn&amp;#39;t know you had until the needle hits it, and then BAM. You can relax again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My proper acupuncturist worked to find those cramp spots; the physiotherapist who gave me acupuncture just sort of stuck the needles in and left me to hang out for a while. That particular part of the treatment had no effect whatsoever on my knee recovery. So.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Acupuncture can be effective, but find a proper acupuncturist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2akg4m", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2akg4m/people_who_have_received_acupuncture_has_anyone/ciw2do5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2akg4m/people_who_have_received_acupuncture_has_anyone/", "name": "t1_ciw2do5", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1405235594.0, "created_utc": 1405235594.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2akg4m/people_who_have_received_acupuncture_has_anyone/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2spfj", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I need to select a junior English and a junior science course.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "UCalgary", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "chw7a21", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "xtricksy", "num_comments": 15, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_2706nb", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_73bo7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "While I can't comment on a science option, I would recommend taking ENGL 201.
