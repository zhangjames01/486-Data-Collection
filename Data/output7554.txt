Lets just say I go to college in the southeast United states. Anyway, its a city college and this house was in a bad part of the neighborhood. So junior year started out fine except my roommates started getting more and more into drugs. Starting from pot was fine, didn't really bother me, but it effects me in ways that other people don't get so I don't partake.\n\n\nSo, as times go on my roommates get more intense with their drugs, moving to LSD, X, shrooms, special k, vicodine, oxy, and of course plenty of weed. Then they started to sell drugs. This is when things start turning around. I'm a pretty serious student and my roommates were anything but, which is fine with me, until it started to interfere with my lifestyle. \n\n\nThese assholes would stay up all night playing loud ass music while I was trying to sleep. They would treat me like a bag of shit for not joining them in selling or doing the drugs they did, and I slowly started to become ostracized for my choices. Not only this, but it seemed as though one roommate, who was the financier of the drug ring, was the only one who had opinions, everybody else was a textbook sycophant. \n\n\nSo of course my grades started to slip away along with my sanity as I struggled to live in a disgusting house, surrounded by people that hated me. This was a down point in my life as things were looking like I would have to drop out of school if I didn't change the path I was on. Everybody was starting to notice a change in me, I was gaining weight, I wasn't laughing anymore, and my friends generally kept their distance from me. \n\n\nAll this went on until my awesome fucking courageous sister and two of my brothers got me out. One day they just showed up, packed all my shit and moved me out. Then began a struggle with my roommates who are now super pissed at me for moving out (I agreed to pay rent, but not utilities) and threatened me all the time, calling my house, insulting my mother etc...But I percerviered and continued with school. \n\n\nCut to september 06, after not hearing from/ seeing in person my old roommates for about 8 months.
