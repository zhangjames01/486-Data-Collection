But it's surprising what a slow, consistent effort can accomplish. Due to various excuses, I stopped taking care of myself and I'm back to square one. Just figured W2D2 myself! I have a few main pieces of advice:\n\n1- Slow down. Yep, everyone keeps saying this. It's true. And it's HARD to slow down. At least for me. Even after knowing what I went through to finish the program, I decided to push myself to go faster, leading me to wear out a half way through the run. I forced myself to slow down and decided that instead of hitting my speed goal, I'd prioritize finishing the run instead (because I almost quit half way through). The rest of the run was tough both mentally and physically, but I reminded myself that I didn't think I could do it before and was about to (barely) get through it.\n\n2 - Know that you will make it. But listen to your body. I know I can push past that crappy lungs-on-fire legs-about-to-fall-off feeling too a certain extent and keep running (maybe requiring a decrease in speed). But I learned what my limit was as well. You'll find yours and likely push against it. And hopefully not go too far. But if you do, you'll know how hard you can push, but also what will injure you or require you to take a longer time to recover between runs. It's a marathon - don't push too hard and then hurt overall progress by needing to recover from an injury or a run that was too much of a strain. For instance, there were MANY weeks (almost every week, really) that I only ran twice because me pushing too hard resulted in muscles that were way too sore or minor injuries that occurred and I didn't want to exacerbate.\n\n3 - Use these first few weeks to really nail down your running form and breathing. They make a big difference as your runs increase in time.\n\n4 - If it's at all possible, get a good pair of running shoes. I went to a running store where they matched me with shoes that gave me the proper support and rigidity needed for my messed up feet. But at the very least, a dedicated pair of running shoes may help.\n\n5 - Rest. Rest. Rest. And stretch. Foam roller afterwards too if you can. \n\nI initially was going to say two things, but then went on and wrote down what I wish I could tell my past self. None of this is likely new advice and I hope none of it is incorrect and guiding you in the wrong direction. I'm not a pro runner (I still don't like it and am going through this again too).
