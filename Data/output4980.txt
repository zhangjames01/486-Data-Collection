That's the root of the issue!

This is the basis of the thing, yes?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" replied John.\n\n\"No, you aren't,\" Hugh growled, \"but we'll let it slide. Now, what if you didn't contribute?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't get a coin.\"\n\n\"*Ha!*\" The barked syllable echoed off nearby buildings. \"Fewer and fewer people contribute every day, boy. Oh, they *participate*, but do they *cultivate* anything? Do they *create* anything... or do they cut from the cloth and then claim that they're weavers?\"\n\n\"Please keep your voice down.\"\n\nHugh went on as though he hadn't heard the request. \"They do the bare minimum that they can. They covet the coins and curse the creations, seeing them as only means to ends... so what becomes of the coin?\"\n\nSeveral seconds passed as John tried to predict the answer. \"It becomes worthless.\"\n\n\"It becomes a *debt!*\" Hugh began gesturing wildly again. \"A coin, a vote, a cheer, a smile... if it comes to you unearned, it's something that you *owe*. Oh, you'll be richer, right enough, but some part of you will know that the books are unbalanced.\"\n\n\"The rich don't seem to care,\" replied John.\n\n\"They *do* care,\" Hugh insisted, \"they just don't *realize* that they care! Watch what they *do*, though, and it's as plain as day! They incur their debts, then they try to acquire *more!*\" More thumps shook their way up through the wheelchair. \"Worse still, they're setting the example for everyone else. These poor sods, shuffling through their lives, each scrambling to be the one to pick up the penny; each drooling out sentences when they should be writing sonnets.\"\n\nThe sigh escaped from John's lips before he could stop it. \"Not everyone *can* write a sonnet, Hugh.\"\n\n\"*They absolutely can!*\"\n\nHugh's roar was punctuated by a coughing fit. It probably should have been concerning, but John was darkly grateful for the brief reprieve. \"Look, Hugh, if everyone could write sonnets, why don't they?\"\n\n\"They haven't learned,\" Hugh rasped, \"to *shut up*; to keep their mouths shut until they're actually ready to recite. Don't you see, boy? They go after the coin as soon as it glints. Worse still, they trample those souls who aren't so quick to rush, and the sonnets are never heard. Nobody stops to *listen*.\"\n\nAs with everything that Hugh said, it made a certain kind of sense... provided that one was willing to accept the old man's ravings as any kind wisdom, of course. \"You're saying that everyone is getting themselves into 'debt' by collecting money that doesn't represent real effort, and they ignore real effort because they're rushing for the money.\"\n\n\"Money, attention, applause, power... all of it.\" Hugh's throat rumbled as he cleared it. \"And the rich are the worst. So desperate to hide their shame that they bury it in guilt.\"\n\n\"Wealth for the sake of wealth,\" John murmured.\n\nHugh nodded, seemingly mollified at last. \"And what happens when *everyone* has coins over their eyes?\"\n\n\"You're mixing metaphors.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" retorted Hugh, but his tone remained patient. \"Answer me.\"\n\n\"Just say it, Hugh.

These poor sods, shuffling through their lives, each scrambling to be the one to pick up the penny; each drooling out sentences when they should be writing sonnets.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sigh escaped from John&amp;#39;s lips before he could stop it. &amp;quot;Not everyone &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; write a sonnet, Hugh.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;They absolutely can!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hugh&amp;#39;s roar was punctuated by a coughing fit. It probably should have been concerning, but John was darkly grateful for the brief reprieve. &amp;quot;Look, Hugh, if everyone could write sonnets, why don&amp;#39;t they?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They haven&amp;#39;t learned,&amp;quot; Hugh rasped, &amp;quot;to &lt;em&gt;shut up&lt;/em&gt;; to keep their mouths shut until they&amp;#39;re actually ready to recite. Don&amp;#39;t you see, boy? They go after the coin as soon as it glints. Worse still, they trample those souls who aren&amp;#39;t so quick to rush, and the sonnets are never heard. Nobody stops to &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with everything that Hugh said, it made a certain kind of sense... provided that one was willing to accept the old man&amp;#39;s ravings as any kind wisdom, of course. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re saying that everyone is getting themselves into &amp;#39;debt&amp;#39; by collecting money that doesn&amp;#39;t represent real effort, and they ignore real effort because they&amp;#39;re rushing for the money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Money, attention, applause, power... all of it.&amp;quot; Hugh&amp;#39;s throat rumbled as he cleared it. &amp;quot;And the rich are the worst. So desperate to hide their shame that they bury it in guilt.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wealth for the sake of wealth,&amp;quot; John murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hugh nodded, seemingly mollified at last. &amp;quot;And what happens when &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; has coins over their eyes?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re mixing metaphors.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am not,&amp;quot; retorted Hugh, but his tone remained patient. &amp;quot;Answer me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just say it, Hugh. What happens?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A quiet scoff reached John&amp;#39;s ears. &amp;quot;No more potatoes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11vp1mi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/funny/comments/11vp1mi/buying_happiness/jcuj7dn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11vp1mi/buying_happiness/", "name": "t1_jcuj7dn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funny", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679248150.0, "created_utc": 1679248150.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/hdtkedz7ypoa1.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I made a song entirely of artists singing \"yeah\"", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "funny", "link_author": "dustin1776", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcu8n85", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "RamsesThePigeon", "num_comments": 2416, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcu8fln", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_59k8h", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It hasn\u2019t been removed.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hasn\u2019t been removed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11svz0o", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/funny/comments/11svz0o/i_made_a_song_entirely_of_artists_singing_yeah/jcu8n85/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11svz0o/i_made_a_song_entirely_of_artists_singing_yeah/", "name": "t1_jcu8n85", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/funny", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679243945.0, "created_utc": 1679243945.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://v.redd.it/5hlsq7tc44oa1"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh33", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Piercing (S)wordplay", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "funny", "link_author": "MurkyWay", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcstdvd", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "RamsesThePigeon", "num_comments": 3, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11ve8b6", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_59k8h", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "So, I'm lying in the dungeon, right?
