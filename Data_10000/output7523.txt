I consider that time the start of our relationship but since I was technically 'the other man' and she was having an affair she likes to count from when she was no longer living with him.  All that aside, because I am comfortable with it, I never thought she would stay with me as long as she has.  \n\nI knew I was an accomplice to this affair from the first day and I honestly tried to end it right then and help her out. I felt bad for my presumptions and such but I sincerely wanted this woman to be happy. She said she took things forward with me because she needed an escape and was miserable and wasn't attracted to her significant other and simply wasn't leaving him because there was nowhere to go. I suggested that she call him and sort it out and other such things.\n\nAnyway she didn't sort it out with him and we started doing it regularly. I figured it would be temporary. I didn't necessarily want it to be temporary but I figured it would be because she is several years older than I and ready for more serious relationships. Moreover I was not nearly as experienced in bed as she and I had to work my ass off to catch up on the necessary skills to be comparable to 'an older man'.\n\n Even as soon as the first month I was saying shit like \"I don't think she likes me, pretty sure she will leave me within the week.\" She has a temper and gets angry and at that time she would get violent with me. She claimed that I was ruining her life and all other horrible things and honestly I thought she would end it because she always said she would.\n\nShe never did end things between us and it has been 4 years. I have no idea if she loves me or not but I am leaning towards the not because not once has she ever told me that she does.   I love her, I am crazy for her, but it kills me to think that the woman I love will never be happy if she is with me.  \n\nI honestly feel as if things got real fucked up when we started going out and that she should go back to her ex.  It isn't like she talks about him or has pictures of him or anything else. For all I know she doesn't think about him.  I just know that when I met her she was so energetic and happy and full of life and now she is depressed and sometimes crazy or violent. Admittedly she has realized this about herself and improved significantly over the past year. \n\nStill I feel that I ruined something that was good for her. She might have felt a distance between her bf at the time and sought me out to fill the gap or maybe force the guy to stand up for himself and take back his woman. Hell, I would more than welcome a fist to the jaw if it meant those two people we going to reaffirm their love because I am a romantic like that.  \n\nThe bigger secret is that I still believe she should leave me and go back to him. It has been more than 4 years but I think he most certainly still loves her and that she could love him again. She has never told me she loves me but I know she said it to him at least a few times, this came up in an argument once when I was being bitter. I have gone so far as to write up and then throw away a letter addressed to this man explaining how sorry I am that I took this woman from him. I want him to know that I think they should be together and that the times I spent with her when she was still with him were some of the happiest I ever had. That is pretty fucked up now that I think about it but it is true.\n\nI fell in love with this amazing woman and I sincerely believe that I have ruined her life and I want nothing more than for her to find happiness even if she has to leave me. I can find someone else with time, I realize this, but it kills me to be with someone and know that I am causing them emotional pain because of it. \n\n*You'd think a WOT this long would result in a feeling of relief for getting something off one's chest but I unfortunately still feel as bothered as I did prior to writing it.*\n\n**TLDR: I have been with my gf for 4 years and I think she should leave me and go back to her ex (they had been together for 7). I have even written throw away letters to him trying to figure out ways in which he and I could work together to get her back with him. I just think she would be happier is all and I love her enough that it would be okay by me if she did go off. I never thought I would love someone so much that I would happily let them go just so that they would be better off but now that I do I feel bad she hasn't already.** \n\n ", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am quite late to the game but I&amp;#39;ve already made this throwaway account so I might as well put it out there:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I my girlfriend and I have been doing it for about 4 years now.

Moreover I was not nearly as experienced in bed as she and I had to work my ass off to catch up on the necessary skills to be comparable to &amp;#39;an older man&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even as soon as the first month I was saying shit like &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think she likes me, pretty sure she will leave me within the week.&amp;quot; She has a temper and gets angry and at that time she would get violent with me. She claimed that I was ruining her life and all other horrible things and honestly I thought she would end it because she always said she would.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She never did end things between us and it has been 4 years. I have no idea if she loves me or not but I am leaning towards the not because not once has she ever told me that she does.   I love her, I am crazy for her, but it kills me to think that the woman I love will never be happy if she is with me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly feel as if things got real fucked up when we started going out and that she should go back to her ex.  It isn&amp;#39;t like she talks about him or has pictures of him or anything else. For all I know she doesn&amp;#39;t think about him.  I just know that when I met her she was so energetic and happy and full of life and now she is depressed and sometimes crazy or violent. Admittedly she has realized this about herself and improved significantly over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still I feel that I ruined something that was good for her. She might have felt a distance between her bf at the time and sought me out to fill the gap or maybe force the guy to stand up for himself and take back his woman. Hell, I would more than welcome a fist to the jaw if it meant those two people we going to reaffirm their love because I am a romantic like that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bigger secret is that I still believe she should leave me and go back to him. It has been more than 4 years but I think he most certainly still loves her and that she could love him again. She has never told me she loves me but I know she said it to him at least a few times, this came up in an argument once when I was being bitter. I have gone so far as to write up and then throw away a letter addressed to this man explaining how sorry I am that I took this woman from him. I want him to know that I think they should be together and that the times I spent with her when she was still with him were some of the happiest I ever had. That is pretty fucked up now that I think about it but it is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with this amazing woman and I sincerely believe that I have ruined her life and I want nothing more than for her to find happiness even if she has to leave me. I can find someone else with time, I realize this, but it kills me to be with someone and know that I am causing them emotional pain because of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&amp;#39;d think a WOT this long would result in a feeling of relief for getting something off one&amp;#39;s chest but I unfortunately still feel as bothered as I did prior to writing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: I have been with my gf for 4 years and I think she should leave me and go back to her ex (they had been together for 7). I have even written throw away letters to him trying to figure out ways in which he and I could work together to get her back with him. I just think she would be happier is all and I love her enough that it would be okay by me if she did go off. I never thought I would love someone so much that I would happily let them go just so that they would be better off but now that I do I feel bad she hasn&amp;#39;t already.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_dvsrh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/dvsrh/whats_the_biggest_secret_youre_currently_keeping/c13c5xz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dvsrh/whats_the_biggest_secret_youre_currently_keeping/", "name": "t1_c13c5xz", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1287992914.0, "created_utc": 1287992914.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dvsrh/whats_the_biggest_secret_youre_currently_keeping/"}}], "before": null}}
