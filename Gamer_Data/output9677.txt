My most recent one was a homeless Irishman I created, who constantly smelt like shit (His hygiene was always as low as could be), and ate only potatoes for survival, he was a modern hero, and his name was Paddy Kearny. \n\nAs it turns out, as long as you can afford a sleeping bag, being homeless in the sims is not very hard, so I decided to retroactively challenge myself another way: attempt to sire as many children as possible. I swore off Paddy's ACTUAL lifetime wish of being an astronaut, and instead used his money to buy a tent, so that he could conceive children anywhere he pleased.\n\nI quickly formulated an effective and efficient routine: send good ol' Paddy to a stranger's house, have him invite himself in, and then proceed to flirt with nubile females until they can mate.\n\nThings were going smoothly at the third household I did this too, until Paddy and his lover went to the house's bed to 'do the deed'. The two slipped into bed, but the mother of Paddy's lover was not pleased, she entered the bedroom to reprimand their behavior. She was almost at the bed when, almost at the exact moment of conception, ominous music played, and the camera panned over to her. \n\nShe was dying of old age.\n\nShe was dying of old age as a dirty homeless man took advantage of her daughter.\n\nI wish I could say I reflected on these events and realized that perhaps I derive too much enjoyment out ruining the lives of virtual people. I wish I could say I turned the game off at that moment, never to be started again. I wish I could say these things had occurred, but no, when I realized what happened, I promptly open my Teamspeak window and said to my friends \"HOLY SHIT MY SIM JUST IMPREGNATED SOMEONE AS THEIR MOTHER DIED NEXT TO THE BED.\" \n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sims is not an inherently challenging game, so I often decide to impose small challenges on myself with new sims.
