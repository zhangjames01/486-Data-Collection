I'm willing to lose the bangs, despite the fact that I feel like I have a high forehead, as I see that working for a lot of the guys on here. I'm also not sure about the thickness. I wash with chamomile and citrus soap bars every three days or so, and it's quite thick and soft after washing, but tends to get limper afterwards (the pictures were taken about 2-3 days after a wash), and I'm not sure how to maintain thickness.
