The only way for GamerGate to appease the opposing side would be to commit to becoming a group about sexism so that a splinter group could then form to criticise games journalism without being considered to be just a &amp;quot;rebranding of the sexist GamerGate&amp;quot;. For the anti GamerGate people to appease the other side, it would require them to allow a group they strongly believe to be rooted in misogyny to demand/enact changes they believe to be sexist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the only end to this will come from much better communication between the sides, but since these issues are so politically charged, conversations tend to go the route of every other poltical debate and turn into name calling.
