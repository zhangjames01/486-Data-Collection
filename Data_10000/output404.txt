I said that nobody is going to ever get to know you if you don\u2019t attract them in the first place, and it\u2019s going to be almost impossible to attract anyone if you don\u2019t do a good job of advertising yourself, e.g., taking good photos for your dating profile. In that sense, failing to take good photos is in fact \u201clow effort\u201d, because you\u2019re completely ignoring one of the most important avenues for *initial* attraction. And again, putting in more than minimal effort doesn\u2019t immediately mean you\u2019re putting in \u201chigh effort\u201d.\n\nAnd yes, ongoing sales is the result of healthy customer relationships, but you have to actually get them in the door before you can build that relationship right? And how do you get people in the door other than flashy ads and commercials that depict the product you\u2019re selling, encouraging them to imagine themselves having and enjoying said product. Then once they actually show up (on your sales floor, or on a first date) you can get to the business of building a strong relationship.\n\nPoint is, your dating profile needs good photos.

I was just being overly pedantic with regard to how you phrased your second statement. Like, generally speaking, having a girlfriend does effectively mean that sex is probably going to happen eventually, but you&amp;#39;re right that you can&amp;#39;t just &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; to have sex by virtue of having a girlfriend. Consent is the most important aspect of any relationship, and the expectation of sex without any additional qualifiers is in effect a denial of consent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You ever just argue with someone even though you know they&amp;#39;re right, and you actually agree with them as well, but there&amp;#39;s a tiny point of contention that you feel obligated to really drill down on?

Your post really hit on something that I've been  struggling with lately, and I felt like I might be able to give you some valuable insight into your situation.**\n\nFirst off, like a lot of people in this thread have said, you absolutely have a right (a responsibility really) to set whatever boundaries you need in a relationship, even if they might seem arbitrary or strange to others. You alone know what you want, and if that means imposing certain limitations on your current/future relationship(s), then anyone who wants to judge you can go fuck themselves.\n\nHaving said that, I'm getting super weird vibes from a lot of other comments here. I don't know how many people here are *intentionally* suggesting that sex cheapens a person or a relationship, or that it somehow damages some sacred bond between new lovers, but frankly, these people's opinions are pure horse shit. There is no magic abstinence-bond that strengthens relationships when intimacy is delayed. Waiting for sex doesn't turn a \"copper\" girlfriend into a piece of gold, and the insinuation that repressing oneself sexually somehow increases your value as a lover and a person is offensive, frankly.\n\nNote that I'm coming to this conversation as a similarly sexually inexperienced person--I only just lost my virginity 2 weeks ago, at age 32. I've dated \"wait until marriage\" and/or generally pro-abstinence types my entire life, and to be completely honest, I got nothing from these relationships except emotional/psychological damage, profound sexual anxiety, and a knack for spotting toxic, repressed personalities. Meanwhile, my current girlfriend--who invited me to have sex at her place on our second date--is the sweetest, most patient person I've ever met, and her overall sex-positivity and generosity in sharing herself with me has completely changed my life. I was literally crying as I read through this thread, realizing that less than a month ago I was still struggling with the implications of my involuntary abstinence, and my resultant inability to love myself because I was so ashamed of my sexual urges.\n\nI know this was a pretty long-winded comment, but all I really wanted to communicate was that you need to make sure you're delaying sex for *you*, and not because you think that it's either what you're supposed to do, or because you think it will be good for your relationship--because it almost certainly won't be. Your boyfriend is probably struggling with his virginity as well, although he seems unwilling to really talk about it that much. If you legitimately aren't comfortable being intimate with him yet, DO NOT LET ANYONE PRESSURE YOU INTO HAVING SEX. But you need to understand that making a partner wait 6 months for sex (which is *eons* in the context of a modern romantic relationship) is going to be extremely emotionally taxing for them.\n\n**TLDR: 6 months is an extremely long time to delay intimacy in a relationship, but you need to do exactly what feels right for you. If it comes down to choosing between upholding your boundaries, or preserving this relationship, then don't even think about compromising. Your body is yours to control, and it's your right as a woman and a human being to decide exactly when, where, and with whom you want to be intimate.
