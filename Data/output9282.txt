Price your items accordingly, but also try to avoid doing anything to intricate that will cost a fortune because people don't typically want to spend $50 on a small handmade item.

If it's something they don't see often, they'll tell their friends and more sales will follow. I personally sell toys and hats and do encourage touching, especially the toys.
