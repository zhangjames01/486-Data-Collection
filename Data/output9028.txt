I recommend the &lt;a href=\"https://hypertextbook.com/chaos/\"&gt;chaos hypertextbook&lt;/a&gt;. One possible takeaway is that there really is no such thing as randomness or chaos. There is only order and complexity. When things become complex enough they can appear chaotic because our limited minds merely fail to perceive the order. Once I realized, that mathematically, there can only be order, with or without God, it kinda took the teeth out of the argument that we need God to explain the existence of order.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: added link&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_dbhkhr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/dbhkhr/hello_new_to_the_sub_im_an_agnostic_who_is/f23n3a3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/dbhkhr/hello_new_to_the_sub_im_an_agnostic_who_is/", "name": "t1_f23n3a3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DebateAnAtheist", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1569931792.0, "created_utc": 1569931792.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/dbhkhr/hello_new_to_the_sub_im_an_agnostic_who_is/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Trump's new rules for SNAP benefits are cruel", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 16, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "link_author": "Boofing_with_Squee", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eyowsts", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "MatrixExponential", "num_comments": 312, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eyory46", "score": 16, "author_fullname": "t2_6m3d2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm totally there with you on empathy, but it's also the rational thing to do.
