It's the height of privilege to believe everyone has 100% choice to do everything they want in life.  In the USA there is an extreme deficit of affordable housing in locations near arterial public transit.  Putting aside that some people are literally too poor to move. Many poor people can't afford to spend 3 hours of their day riding poorly developed public transit, when they also need to figure out meals, their children's schedule, get a healthy amount of sleep and also work 40-60 hours a week to barely make ends meet.  People who are struggling are going to use the infrastructure available, not increase the difficulty in their already difficult lives. This sub has some arrogant privileged assholes who can't see a world outside of their narrow perspective.\n\nI'm privileged, so I've been taking steps to decrease my car usage to a minimal amount, but I'd be a idiot not to see how it's exactly my privilege that allows me to do it. And before some idiot says, \"I'm poor and i did it\".  You still had the privilege to be in a location/country/situation to make that choice.  Not everyone has that option, that option is itself a privilege, regardless of economic status.  But some people can't do good things unless they also get to lord their pretentious moral superiority over others, it's a package deal!  People should just feel grateful that they have the ability to make healthy choices and not lord those choices over others.", "edited": 1678724597.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amazing to me the the person you are responding to is receiving more upvotes than you.
