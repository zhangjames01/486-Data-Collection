Meanwhile anyone on the fence about that Tangela plush is more likely to buy it on the off chance that this is there last chance for two years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely a needless dick move to create artificial scarcity and increase demand, but it&amp;#39;d work and would certainly be better than rushing out new games just to continuously have a new stream of new Pok\u00e9mon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11upyb2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/pokemon/comments/11upyb2/what_pok\u00e9mon_game_would_you_like_to_see_get/jcsjzse/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11upyb2/what_pok\u00e9mon_game_would_you_like_to_see_get/", "name": "t1_jcsjzse", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pokemon", "author_flair_text": "Get blue Spheals", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679205550.0, "created_utc": 1679205550.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11upyb2/what_pok\u00e9mon_game_would_you_like_to_see_get/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rh21", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Posting shitty Sonic facts every day until a new game is revealed (Day 82)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 14, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "SonicTheHedgehog", "link_author": "MooMooCat135", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcseowy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Nambot", "num_comments": 18, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11v48r4", "score": 14, "author_fullname": "t2_fmyhh", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I always find this particular screenshot funny when it's presented with no context, because, without the context, it just looks like Shadow's promise to Maria was to burn up on re-entry to the planet's atmosphere.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "Advance3EmeraldRedBlue", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always find this particular screenshot funny when it&amp;#39;s presented with no context, because, without the context, it just looks like Shadow&amp;#39;s promise to Maria was to burn up on re-entry to the planet&amp;#39;s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11v48r4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/11v48r4/posting_shitty_sonic_facts_every_day_until_a_new/jcseowy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/11v48r4/posting_shitty_sonic_facts_every_day_until_a_new/", "name": "t1_jcseowy", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SonicTheHedgehog", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679201815.0, "created_utc": 1679201815.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/shjcl276hmoa1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rh21", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Why Archie characters never get merchandise", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 9, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "SonicTheHedgehog", "link_author": "Omega_blue_is_first", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcqnue0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Nambot", "num_comments": 22, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11uvizg", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_fmyhh", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Limited demand means it's not profitable.

Someone who played the game long after it's release (and especially after the release of subsequent titles like Unleashed), who already knew it was a piece of garbage going in, or who played it as a child and is subsequently nostalgic for it is going to consider the game far more favourably than someone who played it as an adult at launch.\n\nSonic '06 is a massive disappointment. Prior to it's launch it was hyped to all hell. A 'next gen' Sonic, one that, following the previous two titles, returned to the Adventure formula properly with a multi-story campaign with multiple playable characters. This was going to be the biggest Sonic game ever, and fans were hyped for what was being promised to be the biggest game in the series. \n\nAnd then it released, the load times were ridiculous, the gameplay was buggy, the story was frankly god-awful, obvious sound recording errors were left in, achievements weren't even properly translated, and even the art style and direction was lacking. Pretty much every element, bar the music, had something wrong with it, and there was little to redeem the game, which was a mile from what was being promised.\n\nTo put it another way, you know how a lot of people really hate Forces? It's the same scenario. A game that promised everything, let fans get hyped, then released and didn't meet expectations of what marketing had promised.

How aware of it&amp;#39;s reputation for being a piece of shit were you before you played it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opinion&amp;#39;s on Sonic &amp;#39;06 differ depending on how you answer those three questions. Someone who played the game long after it&amp;#39;s release (and especially after the release of subsequent titles like Unleashed), who already knew it was a piece of garbage going in, or who played it as a child and is subsequently nostalgic for it is going to consider the game far more favourably than someone who played it as an adult at launch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sonic &amp;#39;06 is a massive disappointment. Prior to it&amp;#39;s launch it was hyped to all hell. A &amp;#39;next gen&amp;#39; Sonic, one that, following the previous two titles, returned to the Adventure formula properly with a multi-story campaign with multiple playable characters. This was going to be the biggest Sonic game ever, and fans were hyped for what was being promised to be the biggest game in the series. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it released, the load times were ridiculous, the gameplay was buggy, the story was frankly god-awful, obvious sound recording errors were left in, achievements weren&amp;#39;t even properly translated, and even the art style and direction was lacking. Pretty much every element, bar the music, had something wrong with it, and there was little to redeem the game, which was a mile from what was being promised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, you know how a lot of people really hate Forces? It&amp;#39;s the same scenario. A game that promised everything, let fans get hyped, then released and didn&amp;#39;t meet expectations of what marketing had promised. The only difference is that Forces was a let down in stage design and characterisation, while &amp;#39;06 is a let down in virtually everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ufbh1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/MoonPissing/comments/11ufbh1/i_dont_get_what_the_sonic_fanbase_is_on_about/jco3no9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonPissing/comments/11ufbh1/i_dont_get_what_the_sonic_fanbase_is_on_about/", "name": "t1_jco3no9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MoonPissing", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679121849.0, "created_utc": 1679121849.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/cbs92rphmfoa1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rh21", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The iconic duo", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 9, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "SonicTheHedgehog", "link_author": "Unlucky_Motor2750", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jco1kbg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Nambot", "num_comments": 51, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11uamys", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_fmyhh", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It's good art, but I wouldn't call them an 'iconic' duo, by a long shot.
