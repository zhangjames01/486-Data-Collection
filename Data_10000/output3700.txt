Do whatever you can to get kids into public spaces where multiple adults can see them as soon and as often as possible. The absolute vast majority of abuse happens in the home by family and \"friends.\" Getting kids into public prevents predation and helps get predators caught.\n\n This means:\n\n 1. Free neonatal care, so lots of doctor visits. Hard to hide bruises when you are going to doctor. Right now, people hide by not going. Hard to hide avoiding the doctor when the doctor is free. That raises questions. It also gets better care anyway.\n\n 2. Free early childhood education in licensed schools. This is daycare with an educational aspect. \n\n 3. Slowly transition from summer vacations to more breaks during the school year. This has educational benefits but in this case, it is to prevent kids going for months without any access to help. A summer is plenty of time for even broken bones to heal before they are noticed. It is also a long time for a child to be given a teaspoon of watered-down bleach by their parent (true story, though in this case it didn't happen in the summer and thank goodness for that) every night.\n\n 4. Free prenatal care and plenty of accommodations for pregnant and nursing mothers. Again, we want women who are pregnant to be in public. Abuse of a pregnant woman is horrific in its own right, but it may also constitute abuse of the child. It also may be self-inflicted.\n\n 5. Restrict the ability for families to go out into the country and have a baby in secret. This is how kids get to be 15 without a soul outside of the family knowing they exist. Yes, that sort of thing happens.\n\n 6. Support public transportation and walkable/bikeable cities. This can help older kids get out of the house and go to safer places, like other family members, friends' houses, libraries, and so on. It also gives options for parents, including those who are themselves victims of DV, to get out of the house and/or access the community. Also, babies left in buses don't die of heat stroke that I am aware of.\n\n 8. Enforce animal abuse laws, strengthen them, and require cross-reporting between child abuse and animal abuse enforcement authorities. It is well-documented that abusers often test their methods on animals first, or begin with animals because animals are not protected. Abused animals are a strong indicator of other abuse in the home and should serve as probable cause for further investigation.\n\n2. Do whatever you can to refocus our legal system on the rights of the individual as supreme over the rights of other individuals over them. In other words, parental rights always take a back seat to the rights of the child.\n\n 1. Ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Long overdue. Does not apply to literally any country except the US. Yes, it is that overdue.\n\n 2. Did you know that there is no federal requirement that a child at risk be even presented at the doorway of an alleged abuser? They can show up with or without cops present and you can say, \"No warrant, no entry\" through a slit in the door and that's that. But as a matter of public interest, the police have to produce literal prisoners upon request by a judge. Children should be represented in the same way and it should be possible for authorities to request a judge for access to a child for questioning and healthcare, without necessarily having to get an entire search warrant.\n\n 3. The right to an education should be enshrined in the laws of every nation in the world. Education prevents a great number of harms for individuals. It also serves to protect children by increasing prosperity. Homeschooling is an abridgement of that right unless strictly monitored.\n\n 4. Sex education, including information on consent, safe sex practices, healthy relationship communication, and domestic violence should be standard at any school and any opposition to an individual child receiving this education should be made directly by the child or by the parent **on the grounds of direct harm to the child** as a result of some condition such as anxiety, PTSD, or etc. \"That goes against my religion\" is an unacceptable reason.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to stop child abuse, do two things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do whatever you can to get kids into public spaces where multiple adults can see them as soon and as often as possible.
