Fedora 17 reached end of life in 2012! You cannot reasonably or safely run that on a server on the internet. I&amp;#39;d be stunned if you haven&amp;#39;t already been exploited on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fedora, in general, is not an acceptable server OS, if you&amp;#39;re not going to upgrade it every year (obviously, you aren&amp;#39;t doing that, or you&amp;#39;d be discussing upgrading to Fedora 37). In terms of currently maintained Linux distros that will have similarly old software, Fedora 17 is probably closest to CentOS 7 (CentOS 7 was released in 2014, so it probably branched from Fedora 18 or 19).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I would recommend you get a CentOS 7 hosting plan, and migrate to that, with plans to migrate to Rocky 9 or Alma 9 within the next year or so, since CentOS 7 is also rapidly approaching end of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11u7fgj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/webhosting/comments/11u7fgj/i_need_a_web_host_that_can_install_an_old_version/jcmrobz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/11u7fgj/i_need_a_web_host_that_can_install_an_old_version/", "name": "t1_jcmrobz", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/webhosting", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679095712.0, "created_utc": 1679095712.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/11u7fgj/i_need_a_web_host_that_can_install_an_old_version/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qkby", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Any self-recording people have tips for the dreaded red light syndrome?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "audioengineering", "link_author": "opens0rce", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcli252", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "SwellJoe", "num_comments": 121, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11tq7br", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_5x1c", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Record a lot more.
