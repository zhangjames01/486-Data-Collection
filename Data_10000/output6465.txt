So usually when either weapon hits it will use a charge of flurry. 1 crit (flurry proc) will give you 3 weapon (either weapon) hits worth of flurry.

Now, because both weapons don't have to hit at EXACTLY the same time to take advantage of the flurry trick, and there is about a half a second window in which only 1 charge will be used up, it's possible to stagger your weapons so that your MH hits first, then your OH right after. If you do this you still only use 1 flurry charge for both hits AND you are more likely to get WF on MH, which will do more damage.
