I had a suicide letter written out (it even rhymed), a filing cabinet in front of my door so no one could save me and so I couldn't chicken out and save myself easily, and my favorite movie on. Then I sat and cried and tried to cut with a cheap serrated knife. Barely scatched the skin. Tried and tried on both wrists. Didn't even draw a drop of blood.\n\nThen a couple years ago I was paralyzed with depression and was sick and tired of it. I couldn't motivate myself to do anything, and worse, had no desire to do anything. Finally I got all excited thiking of hurting myself. So I went for it. I can't really say I wanted to commit suicide, but just that I needed to do something to have a break from the pain, even if it ended up permanent. I swallowed about half a bottle of Tylenol. \n\nI tried to then go to sleep, half-hoping I'd never wake up and half-hoping I'd wake up and be fine. But then I kept waking up to throw up, over and over. So then I tried to google if Tylenol would kill me or what. The results were so-so--basically that it could seriously fuck with me, but death wasn't certain. That scared me. But I really didn't want to be put in the mental system, worried it would cost me jobs, insurance, respect. So I called poison control to see what they had to say. The guy was really condecending. So then I called my youngest brother. I knew he'd had messed up friends and might have an idea how serious it was. He was as practical and non-judgmental as I needed him to be, basically agreeing hospital might be the best option but also agreeing it might screw with me.\n\nI had never been to the hospital before and had no idea where it was. I tried researching that I almost chose a clinic that was closed for the night before happening on the general hospital. Then I called a cab. Outside I waited for the cab during what ended up being the most freezing night of that winter (though this was on the CA coast so that's not saying a huge amount). I brought a plastic bag so I wouldn't throw up in the cab. I simply told the driver where to go, paid him, and went in the side-hospital doors. It was very quiet and I the only person there was the receptionist. I hadn't needed the plastic bag before, but while filling out the paperwork and giving her my insuracen card, I began throwing up in the bag. When I was done, I got up again and continued the paperwork. Then a condecending doctor/nurse guy talked to me in his office about what exactly was going on. I told him about the pills and that I figured I should be checked out.\n\nI was then taken to the ER where they checked my blood and gave me some anti-vomit medicine that didn't work for an hour or so. My blood was very high in antiphetamine. They gave me charcoal to drink and started a drip of some anti-antiphetamine stuff. (And later they started me on a potassium drip, which apparently gets depleted in such a case.) There was some social worker who psych evaluated me and seemed to think I was fine. But then I was left alone. Then the oddest thing was I felt SO uncomfortable. I can't really describe it. The pillow was too hot, and no position I could, layind down or sitting up, was comfortable, and I was still very nautious. So I finally got up, tangling up the lines, and sat on the nice cool floor and cried about how oddly uncomfortable I was.\n\nThey apparently thought I then needed 24-hour supervision. Just someone who sat there, all the time. \n\n...long story less long, I spent a couple days soaking up the drips, then a couple more days in the psych ward (though I was fine, but I was really out-of-sorts so I didn't resist). Only my brother knew and I just texted him a few times. The gown I wore was way too big for me and had a slip right where my breast was so I was constantly trying to be decent, and then in the psych ward I wore my same clothes I'd come in wearing, including underwear, the whole time. And I started my period. Suffice it to say I was super uncomfortable the whole time.\n\nGood thing is, they successfully saved my liver. Other good thing is I started an anti-depressant there for the first time that has worked wonders. I haven't been seriously depressed since, though I had been majorly depressed for years straight before that.\n\nBad thing is, years later, I'm still trying to pay that hospital visit off\n\nEDIT: SOO many typos :(  Too annoyed at how long my post is to care.

I couldn&amp;#39;t motivate myself to do anything, and worse, had no desire to do anything. Finally I got all excited thiking of hurting myself. So I went for it. I can&amp;#39;t really say I wanted to commit suicide, but just that I needed to do something to have a break from the pain, even if it ended up permanent.
