I know your dad doesn't support your decision but I'm not sure the only answer is to just pack up and leave and never come back. Even if you do leave, it would be nice to have home to come back to, especially for holidays, etc. If your dad has expressed that he doesn't see you as responsible, then tell him you are eager to show him that you can be, that you understand his criticism and have to try to do better. Emphasize that you respect him and hope he can come around because the relationship means a lot to you (yes, I know this might not feel genuine right now but having family on your side will help out sooner or later). He probably has his own personal reasons for not wanting you to go (esp if you do the chores, etc) so assure him that you are doing this to be a better son and not a burden on them in the future. \n\nIf possible, ask him to come along and visit the college with you and make him a part of the process in any way you can. I know it's easier to just pack up and leave it all behind without bothering to convince your parents about your plan but I hope you only use that as a last resort. We all eventually need support and it's so nice if you can rely on your family, even if right now you don't think they have much to offer you. \n\nOf course, you have to do this however you can but that's just my advice. If he still refuses to help in any way, you can always declare as Independent on your financial aid papers and qualify for higher loan limits. \n\nOne thing I notice is that we always tend to romanticize the struggle...like when you mention coming home tired from work and crashing in your shitty apartment...it really might make you stronger and build character, but it's hard in a way you haven't experienced yet. You imagine you'll flop on the couch, open a beer, and just crash til morning and it's a satisfying mental picture, but in reality, you can't do that most of the time. You have to do laundry so you have clean work clothes for tomorrow night, study for tomorrows 8am exam and write an essay that's due by 5pm tomorrow that you haven't even started because you had to pick up extra hours to save up for car parts/repairs before your car dies again. Your roommate and his girlfriend ordered pizza and it smells so good but you have to put gas in your car so it's ramen for you tonight and the couch you so desperately want to crash on is filthy from your buddies playing video games (while you were at work) and you have to clear it off before you even think about sitting on its lumpy cushions. Trust me, none of this helps with your confidence or your ability to focus on school work! I'm not trying to discourage you at all--just pointing out that being a fully independent, responsible adult can seriously suck at times. You certainly could have it easier, esp if your parents help, but be prepared either way. It's difficult to be out on your own but it's also rewarding and college can make your future substantially better so it's a good risk to take. \n\nI think it's admirable that you want to forge your own path and push yourself more and I wish you the best but I think it's time to stop labeling yourself as a loser (as you do in every post).

A loser takes the parental hand-outs and the easy way and just tunes out the rest (like the crap at home) but you are restless in this situation because you are not a loser at all. \n\nMoving away for school is really exciting and if you decide to go for it, I hope take time to enjoy every aspect of it.

They use tivo and after coming from Directv, the RCN/tivo on-screen guides are a pain to navigate. Even on the hd receiver, they are slow and cumbersome. It takes far too many clicks to do something simple. And I lost quite a few channels in the switch. I would consider changing again but I'm just too happy with their internet.

But on an individual level, it's manageable. There are several payment plans to choose from and two that go by your income so you will only pay what you can realistically afford. I went to college twice (left, then returned years later) and my first set of student loans was before the student loan reform and they wanted over $800/month payment on a small loan. Now I have a huge loan and I can pay under $200 on some of the plans. And right now they are trying to reform the system even more to benefit graduates and the economy as a whole. And all those years that you are paying the loan, you will more than likely be enjoying a higher salary and quality of life because you have your degree. Any time you hear the news or politicians talking, remember that they are talking about things on a bigger scale. Unemployment is 7.3% right now and while that is a staggering number of people out of work, that means that over 90% of people who want work, have work. The demographic that has the highest unemployment rate is generally unskilled laborers since many of our manufacturing jobs are disappearing.

You might have taxes due so you can go to a service and they will do them for you or you can use google to help you figure it out.

With the internet, it's the easiest time to navigate growing up. In the old days, people had to walk from business to business to find jobs, now we just get online and apply and can read lots of helpful tips too. \n\nRemember that if things outside of your control (economy, job prospects) get you down, one of the best things to do is get involved.

If you decide to go to college, it's usually a major transition time when you get to explore new things, different ideas of who you are and who you want to be and find a more solid identity. We all try on different identities and sides of ourselves--that's what growth is and it let's us know who we are and who we aren't. For instance, by identifying with gamers, you've already learned something about your core self which is that you don't want that identity to be a core part of you. That's awesome because it's a step toward really getting a firm grasp on who you do want to be. Just know that we all have those different identities (the work \"us\", the friend \"us\", etc) and that's appropriate and normal--as you mature and create a more firm identity however, your core self will become stronger but you will still have those sides of yourself in different situations. Even your teachers do this--do you think your teachers act the same with you as they do at home...I know a few teachers--they totally don't and some of them are completely different than you would ever think!!\n\nAs far as not knowing what \"do what you love\" means for you--that's normal. It's so nice if you know \"I've always wanted to be a doctor\" because it makes it simple but that just doesn't happen for most of us. And for those that think they have it figured out, they often go to college with one major and come out with a degree in a completely different one. It's exciting to find things that interest you. Your first year in college is almost always the same set of classes anyway (Intro to English, a math, a science, and an elective like drawing or history). It's set up that way so that you can be exposed to lots of different things so you can see what you like. Then you can go from there and pick a major. \n\nThe last part of your post asks how we got out of it ourselves...I won't lie, it was probably just time for me. I learned things, I matured, I let myself be exposed to a lot. After high school I went to college as a Nursing major...a Nursing major who was afraid of the sight of blood! I quickly changed my major but it still wasn't a good fit.
