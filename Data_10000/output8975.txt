Depends on one&amp;#39;s philosophy, but from the point of ontogeny and phylogeny, it is likely humans created pantheons of gods, it is likely none of those pantheons exist, it is likely humans created afterlives and reincarnation, and none of that exists, either. Sure, religious experiences happen, people claim to have spoken to a god or The God, or claim to have memories from a past life, or claim to have gone to the heavenly afterlife and then returned to this existence, but dreams were pretty hard for people to explain and understand thousands of years ago, and lucid dreams or drug induced halucinations and mental health issues and while we are at it, physical health issues were hard to explain by anything but, &amp;quot;karma,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;god&amp;#39;s will,&amp;quot; before we knew about atoms, molecules, genetics, virus, bacteria, etc. Yet people leave their understanding of moral codes up to people who didn&amp;#39;t know that lightning had a natural explanation, and they didn&amp;#39;t need to make stuff up, they could just say, &amp;quot;lightning, IDK&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_83rnwf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Art/comments/83rnwf/karma_by_doho_suh_sculpture_2012/dvkwoew/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/83rnwf/karma_by_doho_suh_sculpture_2012/", "name": "t1_dvkwoew", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Art", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1520870999.0, "created_utc": 1520870999.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/12dc02b8t8l01.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "ELI5: How are toilet paper rolls sterilized?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "link_author": "Le1ouchX", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dutx32s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "darkrxn", "num_comments": 566, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_duti0k6", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3yxw0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "There is definitely going to be bacteria or fungi or both, although they may not be what the FDA/CDC calls, \"objectionable organisms.\" I mean, nobody is catching flesh eating bacteria from however many batches and lots of name brand or store brand TP that have been consumed, but if you tested it for bioburden, I doubt it would be sterile *enough* to use in a clean room\n\nClean rooms do not require zero colony forming units, just zero objectionable organisms and less of everything else than feasible for something that wasn't manufactured with sterility as the goal.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is definitely going to be bacteria or fungi or both, although they may not be what the FDA/CDC calls, &amp;quot;objectionable organisms.&amp;quot;
