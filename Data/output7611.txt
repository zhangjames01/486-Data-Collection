Your statement, which seems to bother you, is actually spot on.\n\nMath is nothing more than following a set of arbitrary rules and discovering the consequences of those rules.\n\nNot all rules lead to useful consequences, but the rules that govern real numbers do.\n\n  \n\n\nAt some point someone asked what would happen if they made up an imaginary number that, when squared, gives -1. It was such a silly idea they called it the imaginary number.\n\n  \n\n\nBut then it turned out that many really useful things pop out when you follow the rules of math with this new number, and, more importantly, this new number didn't break old math.\n\n  \n\n\nNone of the things we calculate with imaginary numbers can only be calculated with imaginary numbers.... It just turns out that imaginary numbers make some calculations much easier.\n\n  \n\n\nSo your statement was actually correct... And there is no proof that imaginary numbers are in any way real, because they aren't. They're just really useful.\n\n\nBut then I would also point out that the same can be said of negative numbers.  You can't have -5 dollars.  That's not a real thing.  But what you *can* do is say that when the amount is negative you owe money instead of having it.  You can't walk negative 5 feet, but what you can do is say that when the distance is negative you mean walk left instead of right, or backward instead of forward.\n\nAnd, just like imaginary numbers, negative numbers aren't *required* to do math.  They just make the math a lot easier.

It was such a silly idea they called it the imaginary number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then it turned out that many really useful things pop out when you follow the rules of math with this new number, and, more importantly, this new number didn&amp;#39;t break old math.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of the things we calculate with imaginary numbers can only be calculated with imaginary numbers.... It just turns out that imaginary numbers make some calculations much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your statement was actually correct... And there is no proof that imaginary numbers are in any way real, because they aren&amp;#39;t. They&amp;#39;re just really useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then I would also point out that the same can be said of negative numbers.  You can&amp;#39;t have -5 dollars.  That&amp;#39;s not a real thing.  But what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do is say that when the amount is negative you owe money instead of having it.
