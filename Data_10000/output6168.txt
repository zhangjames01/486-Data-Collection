But the new episode of MeatEater is out so I'm going to bow out for the day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is in reference to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/ytse59/do_not_pay_a_penny_over_msrp_raskcarsales_banned/) which somehow showed up as a recommended post on my mobile app (algorithms rule).\n\nShould dealers be charging gross markups over MSRP on non rare vehicles?  Probably not.  But what is a gross markup?  Take for example one of the top posts today referencing a $3000 market adjustment on a Nissan Versa.  Is that too high?  Absolutely in my opinion.  But what is \"too high\"?\n\nI was one of the original Mods of /r/askcarsales.  I quit moderating or even participating much in that sub a few years ago mostly because I didn't want to devote much time to a growing sub and I don't post on reddit in general much anymore, as those of you that choose to snoop my history will see.  My dealerships for the most part don't do market adjustments (except for a couple instances I will outline) and we don't do addendums (vin etching, theft alarms, paint sealant, etc) and our service fee is $199.\n\nWe have done 4 over MSRP sales between my 3 stores in the last year.  3 Ram TRX's and 1 Wrangler 392 (unless I am forgetting some which it totally possible when you are looking at around 2000 vehicles sold).  These are high dollar items with an extremely limited supply and nationwide inquiries when they come available.  If the customer was a previous customer and lived in the area I sold similar models to the ones mentioned above at MSRP because I knew I would get service work and already have a relationship with the customer.  If the customer was out of state, I directed my sales people to get $5000 over.  In most cases those customers were bringing a check, had no trade, and were never going to come back for service.  So I got what I felt was fair and what the market proved it could bear.  I know for a fact in one of those cases the customer resold the vehicle 30 days later for $10,000 more than what I charged him.\n\nI have not marked up \"regular vehicles\" (Ram 1500's, Jeep Compasses, etc).  I do however understand dealers that do to a certain amount.  Let's take that Versa for example.  I don't know the exact mark up of a Nissan (I have CDJR) so I will use a similarly equipped Compass for my example.  A base model Jeep Compass has an MSRP of $31,590 and an invoice price of $31,355 and a holdback of $900.  So total gross profit of $1,135.  Now keep in mind we have to pay for these vehicles when they ship, not when they arrive on the lot so we start paying interest from that day (this is what dealers refer to as floorplan, a line of credit to allow them to purchase vehicles).  So the actual front end profit is much less.  So if you are a cash buy with no trade the most we would make on the sale of a base Jeep Compass is $1,135 before expenses (floor plan, clean up, commissions, etc).  Part of the cost of doing business right?\n\nBut you have to remember that new vehicle sales have dropped tremendously in the last 18 months because there is no supply.  If you used to make $1,135 per sale of a base model and knew you could sell 6 in a month and get some trade ins, that was ok.  Now you might have only one of those on the lot and won't see another one for 3 months.  So if a cash buyer with no trade comes in you aren't going to be as willing to take the deal.  Some dealers have simply been saying no thank you, others have done market adjustments.  I choose to be one of the former and take every deal as it comes and decide what I want to do.  We choose to order a vehicle for the customer instead of selling the in stock unit if the customer can wait.\n\nYou may feel this is wrong, or price gouging, or whatever but there are two sides to the market right now.  We HAVE to make more per sale than we used to because we don't have as many sales we can make because we don't have the cars.  Interest rates are up and most manufacturers have shrunk the markups on vehicles, so the cost of the inventory has skyrocketed.  Combine that with massive wage increases because of staff shortages, manufacturer mandates of investments of over $500,000 per rooftop to prepare for EV vehicles, and it has never been more expensive to own a dealership when looked at from a net profit viewpoint.\n\nThat's part of owning a business and I am not looking for a shoulder to cry on or to say that some of these astronomical markups are ok.  I don't think they are.  But I do feel that in many cases a \"small\" market adjustment is warranted.  It is just that \"small\" is open to interpretation.\n\nIf I receive an allocation to be able to order a Challenger Jail Break I have standing offers from customers of $20,000 over MSRP.  How can I say no to that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe \"Enemy\"", "edited": 1677976827.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually if you review my post history you will see I mention many times how I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t charge over MSRP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit.

Part of the cost of doing business right?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you have to remember that new vehicle sales have dropped tremendously in the last 18 months because there is no supply.  If you used to make $1,135 per sale of a base model and knew you could sell 6 in a month and get some trade ins, that was ok.  Now you might have only one of those on the lot and won&amp;#39;t see another one for 3 months.  So if a cash buyer with no trade comes in you aren&amp;#39;t going to be as willing to take the deal.  Some dealers have simply been saying no thank you, others have done market adjustments.  I choose to be one of the former and take every deal as it comes and decide what I want to do.  We choose to order a vehicle for the customer instead of selling the in stock unit if the customer can wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may feel this is wrong, or price gouging, or whatever but there are two sides to the market right now.  We HAVE to make more per sale than we used to because we don&amp;#39;t have as many sales we can make because we don&amp;#39;t have the cars.  Interest rates are up and most manufacturers have shrunk the markups on vehicles, so the cost of the inventory has skyrocketed.  Combine that with massive wage increases because of staff shortages, manufacturer mandates of investments of over $500,000 per rooftop to prepare for EV vehicles, and it has never been more expensive to own a dealership when looked at from a net profit viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s part of owning a business and I am not looking for a shoulder to cry on or to say that some of these astronomical markups are ok.  I don&amp;#39;t think they are.  But I do feel that in many cases a &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; market adjustment is warranted.  It is just that &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; is open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I receive an allocation to be able to order a Challenger Jail Break I have standing offers from customers of $20,000 over MSRP.  How can I say no to that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Enemy&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {},
