I am an early adopter. I am the target for this kind of shit. Sadly though life has caught up to me and I can't quite justify this one.

This way I can focus on upgrading my rig and then when the rift hits a better price point or they release upgraded hardware I can pick a new one up or buy an older one used. \n\nI bought a 37inch 1080p tv in 2006 for 3000$. Nowadays you can get a 50inch 1080p tv for what? 250 bucks rofl? \n\nLook at e-readers, the kindle wasn't even the 1st gen of ereaders, they were just the first ones to reach the mass market. Look at the VCR, beta max, cassette players. You want a laugh? Go find out how much the original Walkman cost. \n\nPeople are outraged because they mistakenly thought they would be able to afford this thing and then BOOM out of no where not only can they not afford it but they aren't even close. It was a shock. It was a slap in the face and they projected this onto the OR team blaming them instead of blaming their own financial situation. \n\nIt makes no sense to subsidize early adoption. Here's the big shocker people aren't realizing. You DONT WANT the first gen of your product to reach the mass market. Do you know what would happen if it did? Within 2 weeks you'd have people complaining there was no content, that it wasn't worth the money. You'd have the market flooded with used headsets from people that didn't actually really want it and got sucked into the gimmick. \n\nYou know what you get by selling it at $599.99USD? You get a DEDICATED HIGHLY INVESTED initial group of what are basically beta testers. No one is going to be complaining about it because they spent so much fucking money on it.

I am an early adopter. I am the target for this kind of shit. Sadly though life has caught up to me and I can&amp;#39;t quite justify this one. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily even the cost of the rift that I can&amp;#39;t justify it&amp;#39;s the Rift + the mobo upgrade + the CPU upgrade + the new GPU. This way I can focus on upgrading my rig and then when the rift hits a better price point or they release upgraded hardware I can pick a new one up or buy an older one used. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought a 37inch 1080p tv in 2006 for 3000$.

Go find out how much the original Walkman cost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People are outraged because they mistakenly thought they would be able to afford this thing and then BOOM out of no where not only can they not afford it but they aren&amp;#39;t even close.
