In fact it is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world (with some of the largest muliticultural cities in the world, both by percentage and population).\n\n* In Britain for example, when you divide people by background the people who control the largest percentage of wealth per capita are: Jews (mostly of European descent)&gt;Punjabi Sikhs&gt;Normal run of the mill Britons\n\n* In a country like the United States Indians make up roughly 2% of the population, but account for a much larger percentage of economic wealth. They have the *highest* average household income of any community.\n\n* They're also much more educated on average, 40% of Indian Americans hold a master's degree which is approximately 5x the national average. For Bachelors degrees it's 64%, while Asian Americans = 40% and 28% for the national average.\n\n* This is an important one: there is a *huge* gap in wealth in India due in part to gentrification and the divide between urban/rural that exists (land is also very expensive, and land owners typically own a lot of it). There is a great deal of classism that goes on *within* India.\n\n* India has the fourth most billionaires in the world (further adding to my previous point). More billionaires than Canada by more than double. Not all the Canadian billionaires are white (many are Asian), I think all the Indian billionaires are brown (I could be wrong though).\n\n* The vast majority of Indians (and any first generation immigrants, really) you will meet came from very privileged backgrounds in India and they likely accumulated their wealth by subjugating their own countrymen (something interesting to think about). \n\n* The Caste system. Hindus make up the vast majority of the population and use it/live by it. Even many Sikhs sort of acknowledge it, even though one of the main (and important) differences between Sikhism and Hinduism is the abolishment of the caste system.\n\n* I know here in Canada we're also among the most well represented in the Government as well, when it comes to \"minorities\". This is especially true of Punjabi Sikhs (about 20 million people worldwide, or about 0.3% of the world's population), even in the United States (like Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal, damn Republicans).\n\n* Sikhism. Maybe I'm a bit biased here (growing up Sikh, now an agnostic atheist), but it's pretty much exactly what a lot of people here on SRS could get behind, but know next to nothing about (and instead spend much of their time on reddit pointing and laughing at bullshit instead. What a terrible waste.). Promotes egalitarianism for all regardless of race, gender, religion, sexuality (although they do make note of homosexuality being 'different') , or colour, non-aggression (unless confronted), defending the weak and those unable to defend themselves, unity, brotherhood *and* sisterhood, basically all sorts of fun stuff. They're also a group that has historically (and even recently, like in 1984 during the massacres following the assassination of Indira Gandhi) been *repeatedly* subjugated, especially in India but have risen up every single time stronger and better. I guess they're culturally very much like the Jews (tight knit communities, wealthy, small population) except with all the terrible religious teachings being replaced with nicer ones. Origin of Sikhism: India (well, actually modern day Pakistan, but yeah). Representation of Sikhs throughout the world: Most battle honors per capita in the history of the British army, more positions in office in India per capita than any other (I think the same is true in Canada, and many other ex-pat countries as well),\n\nSure we're occasionally the subjects of racism, both subvert and overt (Kumar versus Apu), but we don't really \"have it that bad\" and your being white you see it as \"oh no those poor little minorities\", but by and large whiteys get screwed over by the system much  more than people of Indian origin do.\n\n**TL;DR**: People of Indian origin often don't have it nearly as bad as you think outside of India. [Here's one for SRS bingo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-american) and [here's another](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs).

I'd like to see if I get banned for this comment, I actually put quite a bit of effort into it and I hope you find at least some of it enlightening. I'd also like to apologize for insulting SRS, but that's just part of how I see it, a big old bag of hypocrites.
