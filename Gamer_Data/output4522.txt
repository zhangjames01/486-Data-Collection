This is a good opportunity to practice it.\n\nFrom an NCO perspective:\n\nFirst, approach the situation with empathy. Its extremely rare someone actively knows they stink. They're probably just used to it, so approach it from a problem solving perspective. It's not \"Hey motherfucker, you stink.\" It's \"I'm concerned about the smell in here, and we need to solve this together\". It's uncomfortable at first, but having hard conversations is a muscle itself that the more you work it, the stronger it gets.\n\nDo they notice a smell? Is it them/their body? Are they showering properly? With Soap and water? Is there a medical condition making things worse (a la trimethylaminuria)? Are they washing everywhere? (You'd be surprised the number of people that don't wash literally their ass crack)\n\nIs it dirty laundry? Do they know how to do laundry properly? Have them walk you through how they do a load. Is it clothes, or bedsheets, or something else?\n\nIs there something stored somewhere? Expired chowhall food or snacks left out? A spilled protein shake/milk behind the bed?\n\nIf you want to get to the bottom of it, that requires team work together to solve the issue, which means letting them know you are on their side and you can't fix this without honesty. \n\nThis is what a good leader does. \"Unfuck yourself\" should be the last step, not the first one.\n\nLPT:\nIf clothes/sheets/washables really stink, wash them using a 1/2 cup of distilled white vinegar (no detergent). Don't pour it straight onto the clothes but slowly in with the water. This is like nuking bacteria that emit the smells.

This is a good opportunity to practice it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From an NCO perspective:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, approach the situation with empathy. Its extremely rare someone actively knows they stink. They&amp;#39;re probably just used to it, so approach it from a problem solving perspective. It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;Hey motherfucker, you stink.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m concerned about the smell in here, and we need to solve this together&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s uncomfortable at first, but having hard conversations is a muscle itself that the more you work it, the stronger it gets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do they notice a smell? Is it them/their body? Are they showering properly? With Soap and water? Is there a medical condition making things worse (a la trimethylaminuria)? Are they washing everywhere? (You&amp;#39;d be surprised the number of people that don&amp;#39;t wash literally their ass crack)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is it dirty laundry? Do they know how to do laundry properly? Have them walk you through how they do a load. Is it clothes, or bedsheets, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there something stored somewhere? Expired chowhall food or snacks left out? A spilled protein shake/milk behind the bed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to get to the bottom of it, that requires team work together to solve the issue, which means letting them know you are on their side and you can&amp;#39;t fix this without honesty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what a good leader does. &amp;quot;Unfuck yourself&amp;quot; should be the last step, not the first one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LPT:\nIf clothes/sheets/washables really stink, wash them using a 1/2 cup of distilled white vinegar (no detergent).
