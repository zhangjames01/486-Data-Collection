working class, the working class isn't obsessed with wealth, they don't want to be rich, what they want is enough money to put food on a table and buy a house, they want stability and community.\n\nThe same disingenuous argument could be said about the left, they're just temporarily embarrassed \"political elites\", They're just jealous of CEOs with high school degrees and their ability to generate wealth, while they and their \"politically elite\" liberal arts degrees can't get them the same influence and wealth that they think they deserve, so they join a political party and then raise taxes so they can gain access to that wealth, all in the name of the working class (while driving them in to poverty), while 90% of the lefts politicians end up champagne socialists, because they realized it's not as easy as they thought it would be.\n\nI consider myself a liberal (radical centrist kind), I don't care about inequality, I care about poverty, I care about economy but the answer is always \"it's complicated\", and we should apply game theory to it, not just \"tax the rich\", \"more regulations\", I think \"social justice\" is for the mostly misguided nonsense that wants to throw out hard-won liberal progress from the last 800 years, just to make some people feel nice, I think ideologically motivated, poorly though out climate change polices will (like banning oil prospecting), just like Europe, put a noose around our neck controlled by literal tyrants in Saudi Arabia &amp; China.\n\nI don't think any party these days is radical enough in the right areas, Labour just wants to recycle old provably bad polices, while National is just more of the same. \n\nOur tax brackets need a huge overhaul, since the 80s, and 40 years of inflation, we have not seen much of an adjustment in them, People on Supported Living Payment, have their KiwiSaver taxed at 17.5%, because they earn too much I kid you not.
