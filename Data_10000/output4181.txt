Had been dating my current wife for 5 years, and decided it was time to take the next step and get engaged. My wife and I love each other very much. We were in love with each other and knew that we wanted to get married. I never really gave much thought to the idea that maybe she wasn't \"the one\", though. Love was easy for us, and we kind of just coasted through our engagement. We were, as I like to say, completely comfortable with each other and the love we had. We weren't digressing in our relationship...but we weren't progressing either. \n\n6 months before our wedding day, I met a woman at work who turned my world upside down. She was adventurous, outgoing, caring, passionate, thought provoking...she was wonderful. We instantly had a connection with each other. We would usually sit after work and have a drink. Sitting there and talking with this woman about our lives, our goals, our passions...it felt wonderful. However, my home life with my fianc\u00e9e was not feeling so wonderful. We were fighting a lot. About stupid shit that never used to bother us. Our love no longer felt comfortable. I knew it was my fault, but I would deflect the problems onto my fianc\u00e9e and turn her into the bad person. Meanwhile, I'm the one who is emotionally cheating on her with another woman. \n\nThere are two types of cheating. The physical type, and the emotional type. If you asked me at that time which one was worse, I would have said physical cheating. Right now in my life, I know that emotional cheating hurts people on such a deeper level. \n\nI remember sitting with this woman one night after work having a drink and talking about her world travels and experiences. My wedding day was about 2 weeks away, and I was not feeling very excited about it. This crazy thought popped into my head that maybe this was the woman I was supposed to be with. Maybe this was the woman I was truly in love with. Maybe I was making the wrong choice in life. So, I tell that I love her. She tells me that she loves me too. We ended up just sitting there and crying for a good 20 minutes. At that point, I got up and left. \n\nThe next day, I quit my job and cut off ties with this woman. I hated myself and hated what I had done to my fianc\u00e9e. I watched my mom destroy every single relationship she ever was in by cheating, and here I am doing the same thing. I hated my mom for years because of her selfish behavior, and now I am no better than she is. \n\nWhat proceeded to take place was me suppressing the issue and marrying my wife. I put on an ugly disguise in front of our closest family and friends. I even put on this disgusting disguise to my wife...for months. Finally, I reached my breaking point. I sat my wife down and poured my heart out. I explained to her what I had done. How I emotionally let another woman into my life and tried to blame it on the fact that it was because my love for my wife was comfortable. I was convinced that my wife was going to leave me, and I would not have blamed her for doing so. I was appalled with my actions. Why shouldn't she be? My wife did not leave me, though. As badly as I had hurt her, my wife sat and talked with me about my infidelity. She let me say anything and everything I needed to say. She encouraged me to express my fears, doubts, and questions about our marriage. Could we recover from something like this? Would our marriage work?\n\nWe've been married two years now. My wife helped me understand that there is no such thing as perfect love. Love is hard. Love is complicated. Love is confusing. But more importantly...she helped me understand that love is kind. Love is caring. Love is understanding. She helped me realize that love takes work. Equal work from both people involved. She helped me realize that because I had grown comfortable with our relationship, I was not putting in the effort to help our love grow. \n\nBasically...I love my wife with all of my heart. She is able to look past my flaws/imperfections and still find love in her heart for me. And because of that, I want to be the best husband/man I possibly can be. I  now have this spark for life I was once missing. I now have this burning desire to make my next day even better than my previous day. \n\nI know this is long, and might be hard to follow. I just wanted to share my experience with you and point out that people sometimes fall in and out of love. It's how you decide to handle these feelings that will determine what type of love you deserve. I acted poorly and completely selfish with my love. My wife acted completely selfless and determined to make love work. She helped me understand what real, true love looks like. Not the fairytale shit. The hard hitting love. And because of that, I have fallen in love with my wife again and am determined to make sure that we every day we spend together, we keep falling in love with each other even more than the last.

I just wanted to share my experience with you and point out that people sometimes fall in and out of love. It&amp;#39;s how you decide to handle these feelings that will determine what type of love you deserve. I acted poorly and completely selfish with my love. My wife acted completely selfless and determined to make love work. She helped me understand what real, true love looks like. Not the fairytale shit. The hard hitting love. And because of that, I have fallen in love with my wife again and am determined to make sure that we every day we spend together, we keep falling in love with each other even more than the last. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_5cwzhn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/5cwzhn/serious_whats_killing_you_inside/da0zyur/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5cwzhn/serious_whats_killing_you_inside/", "name": "t1_da0zyur", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1479194079.0, "created_utc": 1479194079.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5cwzhn/serious_whats_killing_you_inside/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s1da", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Beer... the new wine, microbreweries, craft beer and the future of semi-fine/haute cuisine.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Chefit", "link_author": "chrisostermann", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cqky5wx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "MJL2", "num_comments": 5, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_33ghs6", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_c5zos", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just got done doing a 5 course craft beer dinner.
