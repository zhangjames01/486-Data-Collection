People try to say &amp;quot;Planned obsolescence is bad because they design them to fail after only 5 years!&amp;quot;. The reality is &amp;quot;We designed it to last for &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 5 years. AFAIK there are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; few designs where people intentionally crippled the design. It&amp;#39;s basically always a tradeoff between cost, performance, and longevity. There&amp;#39;s certainly examples of intentionally making poor performance for no goodreason (like the &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebus_cartel\"&gt;lightbulb cartel&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned but it&amp;#39;s far rarer than most people think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_y6lmfe", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskEngineers/comments/y6lmfe/what_its_like_to_design_a_consumer_product/isu0d2f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/y6lmfe/what_its_like_to_design_a_consumer_product/", "name": "t1_isu0d2f", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskEngineers", "author_flair_text": "Mechanical Engineer", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1666116973.0, "created_utc": 1666116973.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/y6lmfe/what_its_like_to_design_a_consumer_product/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sebk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What it's like to design a consumer product?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskEngineers", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "istyske", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BScatterplot", "num_comments": 76, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_isr4m7w", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4u2kr", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Good point.
