But when you're opening yourself up with something like that which is a sensitive topic for many people, an insult is never the right response.\n\n&gt;  I've been trying so hard to be more secure for 9 years, and nothing has ever really \"fixed\" the problem. \n\nThere's no such thing as fixing it.

There's no such thing, everyone has different preferences, so you can't possibly be \"better\" than you are now.  Self confidence comes from your accomplishments and actions.  It's not anything visual.  That's why \"attractive\" people are always getting plastic surgery.\n\nMy advice to someone with insecurity problems is always that they need accomplishments.  You need to know that you can achieve something that you can be proud of.  A hobby, passion or fulfilling career can do this for you.

Basically what I'm saying is, try to stop beating yourself up over beating yourself up.\n\nIf you think about how happy you'll be without someone that's not accepting of you, it might help a bit as well.  Don't be so focused on him that you desperately need to cling on to someone that has one foot out the door already.  He should *want* to be with you, and if not, I promise there are 10 other people on the other side of that door waiting.\n\nSee if your therapist can help you find accomplishments.
