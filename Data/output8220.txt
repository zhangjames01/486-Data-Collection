But the reason we&amp;#39;re upset with the Dems is that they have the power to get actual reform through regardless of what the Republicans do and yet they aren&amp;#39;t doing it (because securing the votes of their constituency is more important than securing their needs).  Instead, we are ending up with a health care bill that actually does more harm than good... all in the name of bipartisanship.  This country&amp;#39;s electoral system is based on a winner-take-all system (hence the resulting two party system), but when it comes to legislating, our officials refuse to actually employ the spoils of their victory for fear of alienating the ever-mysterious undecided &amp;quot;centrist&amp;quot; voter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_ag9h5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/ag9h5/the_republicans_plan_is_working_perfectly_they/c0hf3ml/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ag9h5/the_republicans_plan_is_working_perfectly_they/", "name": "t1_c0hf3ml", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1261174440.0, "created_utc": 1261174440.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ag9h5/the_republicans_plan_is_working_perfectly_they/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Which famous person do you look like?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c0gmjd0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "rabidfishmonkey", "num_comments": 313, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_aaczl", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_3g1kl", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've been told by numerous people that I look like John Lennon.\n[Me.](http://imgur.com/e703N.jpg)  [John Lennon.](http://imgur.com/xQKuC.jpg)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been told by numerous people that I look like John Lennon.\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/e703N.jpg\"&gt;Me.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/xQKuC.jpg\"&gt;John Lennon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_aaczl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/aaczl/which_famous_person_do_you_look_like/c0gmjd0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aaczl/which_famous_person_do_you_look_like/", "name": "t1_c0gmjd0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1259822346.0, "created_utc": 1259822346.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/aaczl/which_famous_person_do_you_look_like/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "/r/atheism asks /r/atheism why reddit views them the way that it does.
