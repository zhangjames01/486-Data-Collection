It used to act as a kitchen for an Italian ice place that we shared space with through a single door and shared bathroom.\n\nAnyways. One morning my roommate (and coworker) woke up to open the store. Being the young idiots we were we smoked up first and left late for work. When we got to the storefront to open up we realized we had the gate keys but not the front door keys. We were too high to go to the owners to get the keys (she lived a few blocks away and was surely asleep/hungover) so we managed to open the front window and climb in.\n\nAs we start food prep we notice a rat glue trap we laid out the night before had caught a rat. I happen to be an animal lover and even rats have a right to live so not knowing what to do I put on some rubber gloves and my dumb ass tried to detach the rat from the trap. Bad idea.\n\nMy hands got stuck to the trap, the rat clearly wasn't coming off and in terror and probably pain began to bite the hell out of my hand. I was now flailing my arms around, hand glued to the trap and the rat currently glued to and biting me.\n\nI detach myself and my friend realizes \"shit a rat in Brooklyn just bit you, you need shots!\" so I panic and call the hospital and they decide to send an ambulance before I can say no. Now I am not making much money at this salad shack and they were going to charge me out my ass for that damn ambulance so my friend convinces me to jump in a cab to Woodhull hospital and forget the ambulance, leaving him and the poor rat behind. (As a side I know rats have no place in a restaurant but this is NYC and I have seen some shit, and I was just going to let it go, which I thought was the right thing to do).\n\nAnyways cab brings to me to Woodhull. Non-Brooklyn people, you need to know Woodhull is the worst hospital. While I was waiting in the lobby an EMT ran into the hall and just started puking in a trash can. I finally get in to get my shots and there is a girl in a hospital bed with her friend next to her. Turns out she had been there to get a cast removed for a broken leg and was on her way out to leave that day when she tripped and shattered her ankle, putting her right back where she started.\n\nAn old hippie/nam vet in a motorized wheel chair covered in flags and Grateful Dead emblems was in the room with us (large room numerous beds) and overheard her telling her friend she just wanted some ibuprofen or pain meds and he chimes in saying how if she wants he has a bunch of weed in his bag attached to the chair and can roll her a joint. Again, this is Woodull hospital, full of characters.\n\nAll of this is happening and the owner, our boss, now livid has to come in to cover me. She rightfully thinks I am an idiot. My friend heard and saw the ambulance drive past the restaurant and street for a good 15 minutes looking for me while I was off at the hospital telling medical professionals a rat bit me while I tried to save it.\n\nTo cap it off, Luigi the owner of the Italian ices place next door came into our restaurant and saw the rat on the trap. He poured scalding water on it and then put it on the curb and stomped it, but missed and hit its back end first leaving its head and upper torso alive until stomp #2.
