Sarfatti, *Mussolini contro gli ebrei*, 1994: already in 1933 some civil servants were ousted for their Jewish descent; and antisemitic thought is present even in the early days of fascism; for instance in a 1919 article in *il Popolo d'Italia*, June 4 Mussolini blamed the Jews for the Russian Revolution).

His not having &amp;quot;true racist&amp;quot; motivations for introducing antisemitic laws (and instead, say, wanting to please his ally) does not make these laws less hateful and shameful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-racist fascism is a myth; not only the emanation of the racial laws is the end of a process starting at least in the early thirties (see M. Sarfatti, &lt;em&gt;Mussolini contro gli ebrei&lt;/em&gt;, 1994: already in 1933 some civil servants were ousted for their Jewish descent; and antisemitic thought is present even in the early days of fascism; for instance in a 1919 article in &lt;em&gt;il Popolo d&amp;#39;Italia&lt;/em&gt;, June 4 Mussolini blamed the Jews for the Russian Revolution). Certainly he was never obsessed with antisemitism, and he pursued no antisemitic policy until the Thirties; he simply did not care. But as that monstrous opportunist that Mussolini was smelled the rise of antisemitism in Europe, hoping to go to the winning side, he decidedy turned antisemitic.

Me being a linguist is by no means any right to \"silence\" you. You are a professional in your field and I would never claim to be a specialist when it comes to to the old languages of Europe.\n\nYes, my point was that I am not even a historical linguist - I took some exams but I'm doing a different thing. I just studied a few IE - and non IE languages.\n\n&gt; Different minds bring different ideas to the table, which enriches every discussion. But I have come to learn the following: philologist tend to circle around their knowledge of European languages and like to extend this knowledge to other languages. I am not saying that this is wrong per se, but it is the reason why English was once called \"drosophila grammatica\". There are many more possible explanations for what we can see in our modern European languages of today if we take a closer look at completely different languages. One of my favorites is Guugu Yimithirr, not just for giving us the word kangaroo, but for many really amazing things. But that is stuff for another post. If you are interested, take a look into their way of communicating directions and spatial relations. True mindfuck - any other word wouldn't be strong enough to express how amazed I felt when I first read about it. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThanks, I will see that. Actually I had a course on Linguistic Relativism - which included having a look on the high variety of language structures.\n\n&gt; The thing is, that this claim is like stating that the hen was before the egg. There is really no way that - beyond doubt - let's us say that several stems merged into one semantic concept expressed by infinitive be in a language. It could be the other way around that one stem was differentiated into several stems for one lexeme to make sure that those couldn't be mixed up.\n\nHmm yes, it could happen like that - but then, in the specific case, thanks to historical comparison we are quite sure that different stems merged: in other IE languages the different stems kept being separated (e.g. in Greek, *eimi* \"to be\" and *phuo* \"to become\"). Full paradigms for those stems have been reconstructed for PIE.\n\n&gt; I am not sure if I understand you correctly here. Do you mean that this is very exceptional in English because this language has only very few exceptions in general? Or do you mean that in other languages the stem exchange is less of a thing? If you mean it the first way: that would be a very \"odd\" claim because on a closer look all \"exceptions\" in English grammar like irregular verbs are not really exceptional but follow the rules. Only thing is that those rules may be hard to spot sometimes. If you infer the second, this would be not true. The same was found for languages all over the world that are not related to IE languages in any regard.\n\nAgain, I think we struggle to understand each other. I wanted to say that the verb \"to be\" seems more exceptional in English because most of its polythematic verbs have been leveled off, while in other IE languages they resisted a little bit more. But if, as you say, the same is found in languages all over the world, I can only infer that polythematicity is *less* exceptional that a mere look at English may let us think.\n\n\n&gt; Thanks for these examples! I cite the last one because it holds some interesting implications. Did anyone ever look into the motivation for this vowel change? Because it is the same vowel change that happened in so many languages that - may there be something to it? - have been heavily influenced by Latin or are direct descendants of this language. And this vowel shift has been happening fairly recently, like in the last 400 years. Would be interesting to see if the motivations for each language is similar. Have you ever heard of any claims along that line?\n\nWell, I have no idea, but it surely depends of which languages are involved and in which period The Sicilian vowel shift is quite ancient - surely before 1250 CE. As for the motivations, I do not know enough but as I wrote before, \"motivation\" is too strong a word for me. I'd say... I don't know. \n\n\n\n&gt; About your second example: sooo many questions here and I guess I could talk to you about this for hours. But just one question. If this was an etymological process why would your father mispronounce an English word like whiskey? Is it possible that this is not because of the morphological process but because of simple phonology? If your language doesn't have single /w/ as a phoneme, isn't using the closest phoneme of his first language the \"logical\" way to go?\n\nWell yes it's not an etymological process, but in a sense is the *motivation* you look for other stuff: in Italian there is no /wi/ at the beginning of a word, so my father pronounces it /gwi/; this adaptive process is the same that romance speakers used in borrowing Germanic terms in the Middle Ages. There is no need of positing continuity between the Medieval inhabitants of Italy and my father - but it's a way of seeing the phonological change happen live!\n\n&gt; But English war originated from Latin, and not Germanic. The modern German word for war is \"Krieg\". Are you sure that is what happened?\n\nEnglish *war* comes, *through* Medieval French *werre* (and this through the Medieval Latinised form *werra*) from a Germanic stem. The fact that modern German is *Krieg* does not mean that *war* has not a Germanic origin. Apparently Old High German had a cognate, *werra*, which then must have disappeared.\n\n&gt; The French word for English head is tete (if you speak out both words the only difference is the onset consonant), but the German word is \"Kopf\". The German word did not \"get lost\" in the English language, but it only remained as the word cape, as a word for something you put on your head. Why would you say that these words are not related etymologically?\n\nBecause they are not. To be etymologically related has nothing to do with what you describe. Their being phonetically similar may be typologically significant (dunno, the dentals being used more to describe heads?) - but they are not that similar, they surely come from different ancestors, and they used to be even less similar in the past.\n\nEn. *head* comes from Old English *heafod*, whose PGmc precedent was \\*haubuda-, which ultimately derives from the PIE *kaput, the same of Lat. *caput*.\n\nFr. *t\u00eate* comes from Old French *teste*, from Latin *testa*. Latin testa did not even mean \"head\", but \"pot\". It shifted meaning together the original word for \"head\", *caput* (which became French. *chef*), which took a more abstract meaning.\n\nThe shift from \"pot\" to \"head\" has probably happened in German as well, since Ger. *Kopf* may be derived from Late Latin *cuppa* \"cup\".\n\n\n&gt; all my brain cells are screaming out because there must be something that lead these words to become that similar.\n\nYes, and I insist: have a read of Trask, it explains very well how all this works.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First of all I want to state that this discussion is not about being right or wrong.

I'm not a linguist, and you being a linguist are entitled to silence me :) That said, I'll try to make some adjustments:\n\n* My metaphor wanted to convey the idea that *resemblance* does not *imply* relateness. Two similar pebbles *can* of course be related to the same rock, but - and that is my point - they don't **have** to.\n\n* the thing with the verb 'to be' is more a matter of my pedantry. On a big picture, of course you can cite the universal and the principles of economy - but in my point of view it is wrong to say English *developed* different forms of the verb to be when it just retained more forms than other verbs, but dropping for instance *beest*, *art*, *wert*. As you say, there are **still** different stems for the verb. Something that in English is way exceptional but in other languages is not. But it's just a point of view: you may rightly say that IE languages developed, for their many kinds of copulae-like verbs, complex systems incorporating different stems; English inherited that system and kept it to some extent. This linguistic variation of course follow linguistics universals.\n\n&gt; I know the sprachbund theory. But to be honest, I am rather sceptical about it. It might be a useful construct but in general, it appears to come up with some very questionable claims. Like German being more closely related to French than to English.\n\n* I understand your concerns about the *Sprachbund* but I don't understand what do you mean by 'related'. Sprachbund posits that **unrelated** languages develop similar traits due to contact. French-German example does not work well? The Balkan Sprachbund is easier to accept, I think.\n\n&gt; \u200bAnd by single words having \"merged\" in representation and meaning I am refering to concepts like phono-semantic matching (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phono-semantic_matching\n).\n\nI did not know that thing had a name, thank you! Of course that happens and there are some examples. But that happens mainly in borrowings, giving birth to folk etymologies. There are a few examples of something you look for (if I have understood it of course)\n\n* the *dormouse* is attested in ME as *dormous*; one known hypothesis posits the origin to an Old French *dormeuse* \"the sleeping one\", reinterpreted to match the native \"mouse\" part; but apparently there is no trace of that word in Old French - nor referring to dormice, and it could come from ON - d\u00f3r + mous. It *could* be a mix of the two\n\n* Sorry for gettin vulgar: Italian *guaina* \"sheath\" comes from Latin *vagina* \"sheath\"; native Latin words beginning in /w/ (&lt;v&gt;) usually yield It. /v/: *vallis* &gt; *valle*; /w/ from Germanic borrowings, on the other hand, became It. /gw/: *guerra* \"war\", *guanto* \"glove\", *Gualtiero* \"Walter\" (a joke: it's still productive, my father cannot pronounce whiskey and says /gwiski/! ). In *guaina*, the Latin /w/ got the Germanic treatment.\n\n* It has been proposed (Fanciullo 1996 I think) that the Sicilian vowel system, which raises closed /o/ and /e/ to /i/ and /u/ (It. *pelo* \u2013 Sic. *pilu*) has arisen from influence of similar Byzantine Greek vowel raising\n\nSo yes, phonological evolution can be the result of mixed traditions, but we can *see* it. In the case of much and day, we are sure that the similar words are unrelated, since true cognates would have different forms.\n\n&gt;I am well aware as a linguist, what linguistics deals with. ;-) But as the philosophy of this science tells us, its claims must hold true in all cases to a certain degree (not absolutive). And saying etymology wasn't about words is a bit of a stretch\n\nWait. I said \"Don't be too fixated on the single words - historical linguistics deals with the big picture\" - meaning that historical linguistics want to explain regularity in change, not look for the \"true form and meaning\" of the word - like old etymology claimed to aim to.\n\n&gt;You are talking about the words for foot in English and French. But that is not that easy: the English foot derived from the Germanic word, whereas piede derived from the romanized word. Saying that the starting and end point of this etymological process is summing things up is leaving out some of the most valuable information about etymological processes: Whereas the stem for foot comes from the Germanic languages and piede comes from roman languages, the English word head comes from French tete, but not from German Kopf.\n\nIn English and Italian. And why is it not that easy? The point is that these words, which happen to still retain the same meaning, are related since we can trace a chain of regular changes from a common original stem.\n\nEnglish *head* and French *t\u00eate* are unrelated. What do you mean with that?\n\n&gt; Isn't the truly valuable information here, how these two parts of the human body came to have two different heritages is as important as working out where they came from. So, in a sense, saying that etymology is not similarity nor meaning, but regularity in change, doesn't do etymology justice. It must also be about the motivation for those changes, not just the changes itself.\n\nOk, but motivation is a bit too big word, isn't it? Linguistic change happens for a lot of reasons, and I think Trask gives a fair account of them. But of course it's the step further. Most changes follow the principles of economy (the -ch- sound arose in much and mucho because palatalization is a way of economising articulation) and specificity (to be); some are influenced by contact (calques, loanwords, the w of *guaina*) and so on. For some of the false cognates we can very well imagine semantic calque helping the match between the meanings (maybe *have* and *habeo*, or even *day* and *dies*)\n\nMy point is that *false cognates* are less meaningful than they happen to be because of our cognitive bias of \"refusing coincidences\": two pebbles may very well look similar without having the same origin.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid we did not understand each other.

On a big picture, of course you can cite the universal and the principles of economy - but in my point of view it is wrong to say English &lt;em&gt;developed&lt;/em&gt; different forms of the verb to be when it just retained more forms than other verbs, but dropping for instance &lt;em&gt;beest&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;art&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;wert&lt;/em&gt;. As you say, there are &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; different stems for the verb. Something that in English is way exceptional but in other languages is not. But it&amp;#39;s just a point of view: you may rightly say that IE languages developed, for their many kinds of copulae-like verbs, complex systems incorporating different stems; English inherited that system and kept it to some extent. This linguistic variation of course follow linguistics universals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I know the sprachbund theory.

Would you think they have to come from the same rock? or even from the same beach?\n\n* But yes - Frequent words have particular histories - on one hand they change at a rapid pace - on the other they resist analogy. The result is that they usually end up having a less regular etymology than other words.\n\n The only thing is, don't think of linguistic change as a programmed evolution. We did not \"develop\" more forms of the verb \"to be\" rather than \"drink\" or \"eat\", but the opposite: It happened that English washed down personal endings and irregularities in most verbs; as I said, frequent words resist analogy; and \"to be\" retains features other verbs lost.\n\n* There is the concept of [Sprachbund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachbund) or area or linguistic convergence, where languages share features resulting from proximity, independently from being related. But that happens mainly for syntax and morphology.\n\nYou are asking me of single words. I am not sure what do you mean by \"merged\". Take the example of *much* and *mucho*. Their similarity (which is apparent: note also that the vowel has a different sound!) is completely casual: Let's break it down again. You will concede that Lat. *multum* and Protogermanic \\*mekila- haven't much in common.\n\nA. from *multu(m)* to *mucho* only the **m** goes unchanged.\n\n1. Vulgar Latin developed a common hypotethical form, \\*molto, with the loss of final m and the opening of short /u/;\n2. In the Iberian peninsula, the cluster -lt- underwent palatalization, with the /l/ changing to a /j/ : \\*moyto;\n3. Palatalisation triggered the raising of the preceding vowel: o&gt;u, *muyto*;\n4. a second wave of palatalisation merges the sounds /jt/ into /t\u0283/: *mucho*\n\nB. from \\*mekila to *much*, again, only **m** is unchanged.\n1. Palatalisation of /k/ /g/ happens before front vowels (i, e); final *a* is lost; vowel changes are the result of lowering or raising, probably context related (Umlaut): we have OE *micel* / *mycel*;\n2. Middle English [vowel developments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English_phonology#Stressed_vowel_changes) and new spelling: *muchel*\n3. Loss of ending, shift to /\u028c/\n\nOf the apparent similarities between mucho and much, one (the **m** ) is inherited but not that significant - it's one sound! The other, the **ch**, developed in different times and through different processes. In no way one may have pushed the other.\n\nThere are of course exchanges of features in bordering languages - it just works in different ways than these few coincidental false cognates. Don't be too fixated on the single words - historical linguistics deals with the big picture! Also, the key for etymology is **not** similarity nor - or even less - meaning: it's regularity in change. Some of most certain etymology establish connections between words which have no sound in common: the classic *foot* - *piede* relation: both ultimately come from PIE *pod-s but have nothing in common.\n\n* As for the evolution of *day*, actually the shift from /g/ to /j/ is very common and happened independently in many languages. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_\\(sound_change\\)#English) is a brief overview.\n\nIn short, I'd advice you to read some Trask book - they are fun, they are informative, and a good introduction to the main issues of linguistic change", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I do not have English-language up-to-date literature about Indo-European, since I studied in Italy, and also most of my reconstructions are probably outdated since I am not a linguist - only had a few exams.

The result is that they usually end up having a less regular etymology than other words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing is, don&amp;#39;t think of linguistic change as a programmed evolution. We did not &amp;quot;develop&amp;quot; more forms of the verb &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot;, but the opposite: It happened that English washed down personal endings and irregularities in most verbs; as I said, frequent words resist analogy; and &amp;quot;to be&amp;quot; retains features other verbs lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is the concept of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachbund\"&gt;Sprachbund&lt;/a&gt; or area or linguistic convergence, where languages share features resulting from proximity, independently from being related. But that happens mainly for syntax and morphology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are asking me of single words. I am not sure what do you mean by &amp;quot;merged&amp;quot;. Take the example of &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mucho&lt;/em&gt;. Their similarity (which is apparent: note also that the vowel has a different sound!) is completely casual: Let&amp;#39;s break it down again. You will concede that Lat. &lt;em&gt;multum&lt;/em&gt; and Protogermanic *mekila- haven&amp;#39;t much in common.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A. from &lt;em&gt;multu(m)&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;mucho&lt;/em&gt; only the &lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; goes unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vulgar Latin developed a common hypotethical form, *molto, with the loss of final m and the opening of short /u/;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the Iberian peninsula, the cluster -lt- underwent palatalization, with the /l/ changing to a /j/ : *moyto;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Palatalisation triggered the raising of the preceding vowel: o&amp;gt;u, &lt;em&gt;muyto&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a second wave of palatalisation merges the sounds /jt/ into /t\u0283/: &lt;em&gt;mucho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B. from *mekila to &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;, again, only &lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; is unchanged.\n1. Palatalisation of /k/ /g/ happens before front vowels (i, e); final &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is lost; vowel changes are the result of lowering or raising, probably context related (Umlaut): we have OE &lt;em&gt;micel&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;mycel&lt;/em&gt;;\n2. Middle English &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English_phonology#Stressed_vowel_changes\"&gt;vowel developments&lt;/a&gt; and new spelling: &lt;em&gt;muchel&lt;/em&gt;\n3. Loss of ending, shift to /\u028c/&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of the apparent similarities between mucho and much, one (the &lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; ) is inherited but not that significant - it&amp;#39;s one sound! The other, the &lt;strong&gt;ch&lt;/strong&gt;, developed in different times and through different processes. In no way one may have pushed the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are of course exchanges of features in bordering languages - it just works in different ways than these few coincidental false cognates. Don&amp;#39;t be too fixated on the single words - historical linguistics deals with the big picture! Also, the key for etymology is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; similarity nor - or even less - meaning: it&amp;#39;s regularity in change. Some of most certain etymology establish connections between words which have no sound in common: the classic &lt;em&gt;foot&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;piede&lt;/em&gt; relation: both ultimately come from PIE *pod-s but have nothing in common.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As for the evolution of &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt;, actually the shift from /g/ to /j/ is very common and happened independently in many languages. &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatalization_(sound_change)#English\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a brief overview.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, I&amp;#39;d advice you to read some Trask book - they are fun, they are informative, and a good introduction to the main issues of linguistic change&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_9rrnwx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/linguistics/comments/9rrnwx/are_there_cognates_in_the_english_language_for/e8jxxo7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/9rrnwx/are_there_cognates_in_the_english_language_for/", "name": "t1_e8jxxo7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linguistics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1540657312.0, "created_utc": 1540657312.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/9rrnwx/are_there_cognates_in_the_english_language_for/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rm3n", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Vacant Plate - Puck magazine after WW1", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 13, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "PropagandaPosters", "link_author": "gharmonica", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "e8jtqw8", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "dyskolos", "num_comments": 33, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_e8jqhw1", "score": 13, "author_fullname": "t2_5sh17", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I found the date of the cartoon!

sound comes from the cluster -lt-, which is preserved in It. *molto*; ir turns to &lt;it&gt; in Pt. *muito*, and so did in the Old Sp. *muito* which then split into the reduced form *muy* and the palatalized *mucho*;\n\nFrom Alkire-Rosen (2010:84):\n\n&gt; m\u016dltu \u2018much\u2019 &gt; [molto] &gt; [mojto] &gt; [mujto] &gt; [mu\u02a7o] *mucho*\n\nThe passage of -lt- (and -ct-) to -ch- is a regular evolution of Latin to Spanish:\n\n\nLatin| Spanish\n---|---\nmultum| mucho\nauscultat| escucha\nluctat|lucha\n\n\n\n* **much** on the other hand comes through Middle En. *muchel* from Old En. *micel* which sounded something like /\u02c8mit\u0283el/, from a PGm. form \\*mekila- (Kroonen 2013:361). Ultimately a suffixated form \\*me\u0123-el- of the PIE root \\*me\u0123-; so *much* is a far cognate with Gr. *megas*, Lat. *magnus*.\n\nTo sum up, \n\n\\*m(o)l-to- &gt; *multu(m)* &gt; /molto/ &gt; /mojto/ &gt; /mujto/ &gt; *mucho*\n\nBUT\n\n\\*me\u0123-el- &gt; \\*mekila- &gt; *micel* &gt; *muchel* &gt; *much*\n\n\nBoth development follow different and independent patterns. You can see that the -ch- sound is, in English, the result of Pgm /k/ before /i/; in Spanish, the result of a consonant group, -lt-, and is independent from the following vowel.\n\n\n**DIES and DAY**\n\n* **dies** comes from PIt. \\*di\u0113, ultimately from the root \\*di-. The etymology is here very complicated, with the OIE root combining with suffixes and changing vowels (the Ablaut), so I'll just give the basics; (see (de Vaan 2008: 167,170,315)\n\n1. *dies* is backformed from accusative *diem*, from PIt. \\*dij\u0113m, from PIE \\*di(i)eu-m, accusative of \\*di-eu-s; in *dies* the stem \\*dij\u0113 was generalised.\n2. \\*di-eu-s is the name of the God of Sky, *Iupiter*, originally \\*Ieu-pater (father Jove), gen. *Iovis*; cognates are Gr. *Zeus*, Skt. *dya\u00fa\u1e25-pit\u0101*; the stem \\*djow- was generalised.\n\n3. the same root gave *deus*, from PIE \\*dei-u-o , cognates with Skt. dev\u00e1- and Protogermanic \\*Tiwaz, proper name the war god, which in Old English was named *Tiw*; his day *tiwesd\u00e6g* is our current Tuesday.\n\n* **day** comes from Old En. *d\u00e6\u0121*, from PGm. \\*daga-, ultimately from PIE \\*d\u02b0o\u0123\u02b0-o- (Kroonen 2013:86). (This PIE root *could* be related to Lat. *foveo* \"to warm\", from PIE *d\u02b0ogw\u02b0-eie- but I couldn't find a reference to that now).\n\nIn short:\n\n\\*di-(i)e(u)-m &gt; \\*dij\u0113m &gt; *diem*\n\nBUT\n\n \\*d\u02b0o\u0123\u02b0- &gt; *\\daga- &gt; *d\u00e6\u0121* &gt; *day*\n\nHere again the convergence is coincidental. the initial d's come from different sounds: as the Law of Grimm found out, English &lt;d&gt; comes from PIE d\u02b0, not from PIE, which as a rule yields English &lt;t&gt;: see the correspondences *dens-tooth, deus-Tiw, decem-ten*); English also lost an etymological -g- which Latin never had.\n\nYou may ask finally *how* such coincidence of meaning and form can happen; I cannot answer to that but I guess that big numbers allow for coincidence: between a lot of unrelated words with similar form, and a lot of unrelated words with similar meaning, a few, (especially if short) will be false cognates.\n\nWe can also ask ourselves if some convergence was helped in *particular cases*- for example, if the adoption of *have* for the present perfect was helped by the similar function of the descendants of *habeo* - the general meaning and form developing indipendently of course!\n\n\n\nBibliography:\n\n* Alkire-Rosen 2010: Ti Alkire, Carol Rosen, _Romance Languages: a historical introduction_, Cambridge 2010.\n* de Vaan 2008: Michiel de Vaan, *Etymological Dictionary of Latin\nand the other Italic Languages*, Leiden-Boston 2008.\n* Kroonen 2013: Guus Kroonen, *Etymological Dictionary\nof Proto-Germanic*, Leiden-Boston 2013.\n\nNote that quick, and roughly correct, etymologies can be found in Wiktionary.\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MUCH and MUCHO&lt;/strong&gt;\nLet&amp;#39;s start with the etymology of the single words:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mucho&lt;/strong&gt;  /\u02c8mut\u0283o/ comes from Lat. multu(m), from PIE *m(o)l-to- (de Vaan 2008:394) ultimately from a IE root *mel;the &amp;lt;ch&amp;gt; sound comes from the cluster -lt-, which is preserved in It. &lt;em&gt;molto&lt;/em&gt;; ir turns to &amp;lt;it&amp;gt; in Pt. &lt;em&gt;muito&lt;/em&gt;, and so did in the Old Sp. &lt;em&gt;muito&lt;/em&gt; which then split into the reduced form &lt;em&gt;muy&lt;/em&gt; and the palatalized &lt;em&gt;mucho&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From Alkire-Rosen (2010:84):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;m\u016dltu \u2018much\u2019 &amp;gt; [molto] &amp;gt; [mojto] &amp;gt; [mujto] &amp;gt; [mu\u02a7o] &lt;em&gt;mucho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The passage of -lt- (and -ct-) to -ch- is a regular evolution of Latin to Spanish:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Latin&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Spanish&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;multum&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;mucho&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;auscultat&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;escucha&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;luctat&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;lucha&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand comes through Middle En. &lt;em&gt;muchel&lt;/em&gt; from Old En. &lt;em&gt;micel&lt;/em&gt; which sounded something like /\u02c8mit\u0283el/, from a PGm. form *mekila- (Kroonen 2013:361).
