down, be honest with yourself, and make a plan.  Decide what your short term goals are (you need food, water, shelter, etc.), decide what your long term realistic goals are (maybe getting a job at a stock exchange?), decide what your dreamy goals are (maybe being an actual stock trader?), then plan your middle term *actions* to get there.  This is your strength; you are good at planning.  Then *do it*.  Be honest about how much work you need to do, how much it will cost, etc.  Get a real plan together, with emphasis on every little last detail.  Don't just say, \"I need to go to college,\" say, \"I need to go to one of these three colleges,\" and name them.  Don't stop there.  Once you've got the plan outlined, do research.  Find out exactly what major at each of them is best for your goal.  Find out the names of the classes you would need to take.  Find out the names of the professors you will have; look at their photos for a few moments.  Decide when you will apply for school.  Decide how hard you will work / how much you will party.  (The correct solution is rarely 100% working.)  The point here is to have a *real* plan, one with details, one with small actionable steps that you understand.  \n\nThe difference between my high school friends who \"were going to work for a while then go to college\" or \"were going to go to community college for two years then transfer\" and didn't &amp; my high school friends who funded their way to college is that the latter had an actual plan with exact details while the first just had the general goal of \"surely something better will come along; this will just fall into place.\"  No.  You must place it.  Plans are where we draw our motivation.  Once you have *that*, your job as a waiter will be much more tolerable because it will be a step in the plan.  \n\nA lot of younger people have a problem because they don't *really* know what they want to do.  If that's you, then just adjust the plan accordingly but maintain the level of detail; actually, you need to increase it.  Study every major a university has to offer, talk to anyone willing, find career counselors at universities and see if they will help you choose a path that allows for change if you decide something isn't right after a semester.  You want to find a career that offers you three things: 1) I enjoy it, 2) I am good at it, 3) Someone will pay me money to do it.  No one of these three is less important than the others if success is to be had.\n\nIn short, if you don't really want to do the waiter job (but have to for short term money needs), make it a step in a larger detailed plan.  That way, you'll properly understand its place which will making dealing with the hard parts much more doable.  When some customer is angry and wrong, you'll be able to step outside of it because this is just short term - a la \"I don't need to prove I'm right; just take the free dessert and get out of my life because I'm moving on to better things and you've got no one to take your anger out on then a waiter.\"\n\nBest of luck to you.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know exactly where you are in life, so adjust the following to fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find a time where you have a few free hours, go somewhere you can think, sit down, be honest with yourself, and make a plan.  Decide what your short term goals are (you need food, water, shelter, etc.), decide what your long term realistic goals are (maybe getting a job at a stock exchange?), decide what your dreamy goals are (maybe being an actual stock trader?), then plan your middle term &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; to get there.  This is your strength; you are good at planning.  Then &lt;em&gt;do it&lt;/em&gt;.  Be honest about how much work you need to do, how much it will cost, etc.  Get a real plan together, with emphasis on every little last detail.  Don&amp;#39;t just say, &amp;quot;I need to go to college,&amp;quot; say, &amp;quot;I need to go to one of these three colleges,&amp;quot; and name them.  Don&amp;#39;t stop there.  Once you&amp;#39;ve got the plan outlined, do research.  Find out exactly what major at each of them is best for your goal.  Find out the names of the classes you would need to take.  Find out the names of the professors you will have; look at their photos for a few moments.  Decide when you will apply for school.  Decide how hard you will work / how much you will party.  (The correct solution is rarely 100% working.)  The point here is to have a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; plan, one with details, one with small actionable steps that you understand.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference between my high school friends who &amp;quot;were going to work for a while then go to college&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;were going to go to community college for two years then transfer&amp;quot; and didn&amp;#39;t &amp;amp; my high school friends who funded their way to college is that the latter had an actual plan with exact details while the first just had the general goal of &amp;quot;surely something better will come along; this will just fall into place.&amp;quot;  No.  You must place it.  Plans are where we draw our motivation.  Once you have &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, your job as a waiter will be much more tolerable because it will be a step in the plan.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of younger people have a problem because they don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know what they want to do.  If that&amp;#39;s you, then just adjust the plan accordingly but maintain the level of detail; actually, you need to increase it.  Study every major a university has to offer, talk to anyone willing, find career counselors at universities and see if they will help you choose a path that allows for change if you decide something isn&amp;#39;t right after a semester.  You want to find a career that offers you three things: 1) I enjoy it, 2) I am good at it, 3) Someone will pay me money to do it.  No one of these three is less important than the others if success is to be had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, if you don&amp;#39;t really want to do the waiter job (but have to for short term money needs), make it a step in a larger detailed plan.  That way, you&amp;#39;ll properly understand its place which will making dealing with the hard parts much more doable.  When some customer is angry and wrong, you&amp;#39;ll be able to step outside of it because this is just short term - a la &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t need to prove I&amp;#39;m right; just take the free dessert and get out of my life because I&amp;#39;m moving on to better things and you&amp;#39;ve got no one to take your anger out on then a waiter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_oiv7v", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/intj/comments/oiv7v/need_your_help_to_push_me_over_the_edge/c3hp5yk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/oiv7v/need_your_help_to_push_me_over_the_edge/", "name": "t1_c3hp5yk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/intj", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1326716155.0, "created_utc": 1326716155.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/oiv7v/need_your_help_to_push_me_over_the_edge/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm4e", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Is horizontal gene transfer possible?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "askscience", "link_author": "arethnaar", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c3hk759", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Stereotypical_INTJ", "num_comments": 9, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_oil5n", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_4rkh5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Downvoted because you can simply google this and read the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer) article for a great explanation.
