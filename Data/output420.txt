Insurance companies have never run at &amp;quot;huge profits&amp;quot;.  They&amp;#39;re very bad investments in general compared to other companies.  You know so little about insurance, you don&amp;#39;t even know their funding mechanism.  Holy hell, open a book before you speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is incredibly unlikely that they would ever be in a position where they couldn&amp;#39;t increase the rates fast enough to cover upcoming unexpected payouts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not how insurance works....at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look, it&amp;#39;s been hilarious, but with each reply you make it 100% clear you have no idea what insurance is, how it operates, or even the basic mechanisms of it.
