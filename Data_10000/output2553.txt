So I wonder if instead of doing in-situ analyses we should be spending our time trying to improve the seismology toolkit to get an actual high resolution picture of what&amp;#39;s below a volcano? Heck we might not even need to improve the toolkit as much as spend way more money on seismometers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I am not a seismologist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PPS: The selection bias in geochemistry is enormous and no one gives a full accounting of their sample vs the things they&amp;#39;ve just selected. I would bet a lot of analyses also go unreported because they contradict the story the authors are trying to tell. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_a2hwnw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/science/comments/a2hwnw/supervolcanoes_can_warm_up_and_go_off_in_less/eb04me0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/a2hwnw/supervolcanoes_can_warm_up_and_go_off_in_less/", "name": "t1_eb04me0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/science", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1543850582.0, "created_utc": 1543850582.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/2018/12-01/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mouw", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Supervolcanoes can warm up and go off in less than 10 years, not thousands.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "science", "link_author": "OldCoderK", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eaz557y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "fastparticles", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eayieif", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_48w9h", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree I think most of the evidence that is marshaled for quick melting of reservoirs is seriously misinterpreted.
