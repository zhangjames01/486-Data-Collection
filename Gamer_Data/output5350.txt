Ideally something that can help with combat which was kinda lacking in your build:\n\n* [Galadriels Handmaiden](https://ringsdb.com/card/08117) is a great ally. 2WP for 2 cost is always useful and the threat reduction is icing on the cake.\n\n* [Treebeard](https://ringsdb.com/card/08146) has awesome combat stats and can ready himself every 2nd turn. Yes he enters play exhausted, but he's more than worth it in the long run.\n\n* [Northern Tracker](https://ringsdb.com/card/01045) is a classic and can help with location lock. Also decent combat stats.\n\n* [Faramir](https://ringsdb.com/card/01014) can add *a lot* of questing power (especially once you have a couple of Weavers or Handmaidens). You can hold his ability until after you've revealed the encounter cards and then decide whether you need the willpower or maybe better use him to defend or finish off an enemy.\n\n* [Orophin](https://ringsdb.com/card/08114) mostly because I wanted another leadership ally and for his flexible 2WP/2ATK. His *Response* can also bring back a Weaver or Handmaiden if you had to discard one during the 2nd quest stage.\n\nYou could also test Guardian of Arnor or Warden of Helms Deep if you want additional defenders.       \nThe Galadrim Weavers can quest and are a cheap sacrifice for the 2nd stage. Try using them to shuffle Gandalf, Sneak Attack or Test of Will back into the deck if the opportunity comes up, but that's more of an extra than a priority.\n\nLet's talk attachments and events:\n\n* [Celebrians Stone](https://ringsdb.com/card/01027) for Aragorn. Mostly for the +2WP, but the spirit resource icon is also useful in combination with Steward.\n\n* 2x Unexpected Courage, but only 1x Heir of Mardil - It's a classic spirit card for a good reason and should go on Aragorn. I mostly used it to quest (*once [Cold from Angmar](https://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Cold-from-Angmar-TLR?Lang=EN) disables his ability - happened in almost all my games during stage 1*) or ofc during the combat phase. Courage costs 1 extra resource, but is easier to use imho.\n\n* I dropped [Silver Harp](https://ringsdb.com/card/10090) as you generally only discard [Elven-light](https://ringsdb.com/card/10145) anyway. \n\n* 3x [Test of Will](https://ringsdb.com/card/01050). The treacheries are just nasty and this can prevent an instant gameover for little cost.\n\n* 3x [Sneak Attack](https://ringsdb.com/card/01023) is a must-have in leadership decks (at least with a smaller card pool).      \nSneak Attack + Gandalf can solve so many problems: His direct damage can kill most enemies (especially the annoying [White Wargs](https://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/White-Warg-TWoE?Lang=EN)), he can help keep the threat in check or you can use him to draw cards in a pinch (mostly only if you didn't manage to find Elven-light yet).      \nAnd you get his awesome stats for combat or a quest push.           \nYou can also use Sneak Attack with Faramir (to activate his ability) during the quest phase or to get an emergency defender in a pinch. But mostly you want to hold it for Gandalf.\n\n* 2x Galadrims Greeting for the threat reduction. Stage 1 can take longer than you'd like (which isn't necessarily a bad thing - Use the time to establish your board and then rush through the other stages) and that threat increase will add up.\n\n* I dropped [Ranger Summons](https://ringsdb.com/card/09007). It's a fun card, but mostly for multiplayer. It's too random for solo play and as we're already struggling it's probably a bad idea to include gimmicks like this.\n\n* Dito for [Dunedain Message](https://ringsdb.com/card/10056) and the player side quests. They don't really work well for this particular quest imho (as the Day/Night mechanic means you can only clear quests every 2nd turn and then there's a [nasty treachery](https://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Weight-of-Responsibility-TLR?&amp;Lang=EN)). I left Gather Information in the deck 'cause it's easily the best of them, but I actually only cleared it once during my test games.\n\n\n***\n\nAnother thing you could try: You could swap to tactics Aragorn! (You don't have to increase your threat if you change to a different hero version)  \n     \nYou'd lose Steward and Sneak Attack, but gain useful events like Feint and the tactics ents would pair nicely with Treebeard.      \nI tested that for a bit, but [Cold from Angmar](https://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Cold-from-Angmar-TLR?Lang=EN) kinda ruined my Ent strategy and overall the leadership version seemed to work a bit better.\n\nEDIT: I totally forgot that his card exists, but 1-2 [Power of Orthanc](https://ringsdb.com/card/07014) could help with that.\n\n***\n\n&gt; So, are there any house rules to adjust this scenario for true solo players?\n\nHave you tried the official \"Easy Mode\"?      \nNot a fan of the name (\"Easy\" my a\\*\\* ) but the extra starting resources do help to get a footing and it removes some (extra copies) of particularily nasty encounter cards.\n\nOr you can do what the community calls \"sleazy mode\" - Just start with one additional resource on each hero. \n\n***\n\nUgh this turned out to be more text than I planned lol. I hope my rambling is at least somewhat useful!\n\nEDIT2: Also check out the awesome [Vision of the Planatir scenario analysis](https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/10/22/the-wastes-of-eriador/) for strategy tips, common pitfalls and an explanation of all the special quest rules!", "edited": 1666667709.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "sphere tactics", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using this deck &lt;a href=\"https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/370786\"&gt;https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/370786&lt;/a&gt; which did wonders for the first three scenarios, but at this one I just can&amp;#39;t beat the first stage&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I playtested your hero lineup with a couple of tweaks:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/32728/deckfeedbackangmarawakenedsolodeck-3.0\"&gt;https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/32728/deckfeedbackangmarawakenedsolodeck-3.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t claim that this is the ultimate, super optimized deck or anything, but it should have a decent shot at winning.&lt;br/&gt;\n(Won 3/lost 2 with my final build during testing and I had some nasty draws)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mostly changed the allies to include a couple of staple power cards.

The invincible Balrog is looming in the staging area and grows ever stronger. You'll be digging through various quest stages in random order looking to find a way out.\n          \nOverall it's very Tolkien and quite fun, but also not very unique as there's a couple of other quests with a similar vibe. You'll revisit Moria during the saga campaign and the *Dark of Mirkwood* scenario pack also heavily features caves and goblins (and also borrows the Cave Torch mechanic).\n\n\nThe Sands of Harad has us stranded in the far away Umbar and the surrounding desert lands.           \nIt features Haradrim enemies and allies, the city streets of Umbar and scorching hot desert, sand worms and other exotic creatures...\n\nIt's a fresh, new theme and well executed, but the more exotic nature might not be for everyone.\n\n* *Escape from Umbar*: A fun quest that requires a balanced mix of questing and combat and has a special loss condition. You better start fast or you'll get cought on the first turn! Difficulty-wise it's pretty fair, though.       \nAlso a popular deck testing quest for more experienced players (Quick to set up, no overcomplicated mechanics, tests all areas of your deck equally)\n\n* *Desert Crossing*: Another fast-paced quest with the unique temperature mechanic. Get moving or you'll suffer in the sun as enemies and locations get ever stronger! Also sand worms. (No Spice though)\n\n* *The Long Arm of Mordor:* I'm using the word \"unique\" quite a lot here, but for this one it's really warranted. Capturing one hero is for amateurs as this time you'll lose all of them! But don't worry - Unlike *Escape from Dol Guldur* it's actually fun. You get to choose one of several objective heroes (yes, that's a thing) with different stats and abilities. It starts kinda slow as you free your other heroes and ends with a big, nasty boss fight.\n\n\nDifficulty-wise *Khazad-Dum* is overall easier, but also a bit more swingy.     \n(Nasty cancel-or-die treacheries with only 1 copy in the deck, 1-2 strong boss-type enemies in a large encounter deck - Maybe you'll see them, maybe you won't and that causes variance in the difficulty)\n\n*Sands of Harad* is newer and imho better designed, but also more difficult and the various unique mechanics that make this box (and cycle) so enjoyable for experienced players might be a bit overwhelming for newer players.      \n(Though I think there's nothing too complicated in the deluxe box and it's generally well explained.

I need to finish my deck writeup at some point, but basically the idea was to take the Rohan starter deck and boost it with some cards from just the first ALeP box while keeping close to the original gameplan. (So no Dunhere/Fastred or Thengel.)\n\nTurns out it just needs a few extra cards and it can really show the strength of Rohan!\n\n[Herubrand](https://ringsdb.com/card/300004) is a great replacement for the overused tactics Eowyn *(Don't get me wrong - She and her art are awesome, but she's basically the default tactics hero at this point)*. [Light-footed Steed](https://ringsdb.com/card/300016) is the generic mount that Steed of the Mark could've/should've been and works great. And thanks to [Deeping Defender](https://ringsdb.com/card/300009) there's finally a good defensive option.\n\n***\n\nMy current \"project\" is a full playthrough of the Dreamchaser cycle with Pirate Brahms awesome [**BearEstor Recurs Redundantly**](https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/28502/bearestorrecursredundantlyagain-1.0) deck (with some small tweaks).\n\nA very unique take on the Noldor discard theme (No \"To the Sea!\" and the usual strong Noldor allies) and it's a really fun, reliable combo. Also very thematic... I'm pretty sure that bears can swim, right? :D\n\n[**Beorn and friends crushing Raid on Grey Havens.**](https://i.imgur.com/uTU4nef.png)\n\n\n***\n\n&gt; **Weekly Question**\n\nDuring the last COTR episode they were reviewing/tardy taking Erestor and someone mentioned that he's so fun to play 'cause he gives you so many options and that you don't have to dedicate so much of your deck space to \"boring\" card draw when you play with him. \n\nJust paraphrasing from memory and I don't recall who actually said it, but it stuck with me and got me thinking.\n\nSo yeah my QOL feature would be more or better build-in card draw each turn.       \nMaybe just two cards per turn or something like \"draw three, choose one\". I played an online CCG ages ago called Duelyst and afair they had a \"replacement\" mechanism at some point where you could shuffle back and redraw one card per turn.\n\nI know it wouldn't really work with the current game balance and card pool, but it could be interesting and would allow you to run more situational cards.

I need to finish my deck writeup at some point, but basically the idea was to take the Rohan starter deck and boost it with some cards from just the first ALeP box while keeping close to the original gameplan. (So no Dunhere/Fastred or Thengel.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turns out it just needs a few extra cards and it can really show the strength of Rohan!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://ringsdb.com/card/300004\"&gt;Herubrand&lt;/a&gt; is a great replacement for the overused tactics Eowyn &lt;em&gt;(Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong - She and her art are awesome, but she&amp;#39;s basically the default tactics hero at this point)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=\"https://ringsdb.com/card/300016\"&gt;Light-footed Steed&lt;/a&gt; is the generic mount that Steed of the Mark could&amp;#39;ve/should&amp;#39;ve been and works great. And thanks to &lt;a href=\"https://ringsdb.com/card/300009\"&gt;Deeping Defender&lt;/a&gt; there&amp;#39;s finally a good defensive option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current &amp;quot;project&amp;quot; is a full playthrough of the Dreamchaser cycle with Pirate Brahms awesome &lt;a href=\"https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/28502/bearestorrecursredundantlyagain-1.0\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BearEstor Recurs Redundantly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deck (with some small tweaks).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A very unique take on the Noldor discard theme (No &amp;quot;To the Sea!&amp;quot; and the usual strong Noldor allies) and it&amp;#39;s a really fun, reliable combo. Also very thematic...
