I think if you especially spend too much time online talking to other men, it's hard to grasp this because there's a large amount of projecting involved.\n\nLike I can already tell based on your title that (and you seem to be used to this), people probably don't care about you enough to read or be empathetic to your post, instead spout their own personal views and complaints about the matter and then leave.\n\nI too, can also probably tell that while you don't mean this to be a pity... you did write the post, and it's not like it was a short one.

Once again, no judgement, and I could very well be off base.

Maybe you should realize too, that maybe you might not necessarily be as good of a friend as you think you are, based on where your core motivations lie. I'm not saying one is better than the other, but I'd just say notice if you actually miss say, a specific friend... or do you just hate that they aren't spending time with you when you want it, and do you just not like like you don't have anyone around now to tell people about the great things that are going on in your life?
