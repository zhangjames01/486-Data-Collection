The extremes to my mind are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A critique of the patriarchy and how it drags us all down. The MC is a wage slave who has to go to a staff event where she gets treated like arm candy. In the process of that she is disabled and made unemployed. She is then forced to fight back against all the adversity, realising that some of the stuff she is doing makes her a morally worse person but that this is a function of the system and a system she is trying to fight. In this interpretation the book is a pastiche on the traditional superhero line where the superheroes are actually the bad guys. Its about her rise in becoming a supervillain and in doing so she becomes a stereotypical villain. Her disability is part of this cliche of villainy. This is not ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A satire of modern society and of the way we think of ourselves as victims and in doing so ignore the hardships of others. In this perspective, the MC considers herself a wage slave despite renting an apartment, having a driver and having money for luxuries. She goes to a work event which involves the torture of a child which she does nothing to stop. She comes out of this disabled which she blames on others. She proceeds to ruin other peoples lives which she thinks is ok because she is the real victim. In this interpretation the disability goes hand in hand with her decent into villainy and in many ways is a turning point in her becoming a worse person. This is not ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For me the book only makes sense if you consider it from the second perspective. Either way, its not ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1091vrf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Fantasy/comments/1091vrf/books_about_the_condition_of_chronic_pain_or/j40hnk9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1091vrf/books_about_the_condition_of_chronic_pain_or/", "name": "t1_j40hnk9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673514414.0, "created_utc": 1673514414.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1091vrf/books_about_the_condition_of_chronic_pain_or/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Books about the condition of chronic pain or character depictions of chronic pain", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Fantasy", "link_author": "BigBagZiv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j3ybm6c", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "bamspoozle", "num_comments": 144, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j3xt3b3", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g3d6w", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sure, for the record, I like antiheroes I object to\n* Disability being a punishment for an immoral act\n* Disability being a sign of moral corruption\n\nThere are many morally grey disabled characters, e.g. GOT spoiler &gt;!Jaime Lannister!&lt;", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, for the record, I like antiheroes I object to\n* Disability being a punishment for an immoral act\n* Disability being a sign of moral corruption&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many morally grey disabled characters, e.g. GOT spoiler &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Jaime Lannister&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1091vrf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Fantasy/comments/1091vrf/books_about_the_condition_of_chronic_pain_or/j3ybm6c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1091vrf/books_about_the_condition_of_chronic_pain_or/", "name": "t1_j3ybm6c", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673475341.0, "created_utc": 1673475341.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1091vrf/books_about_the_condition_of_chronic_pain_or/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Books about the condition of chronic pain or character depictions of chronic pain", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Fantasy", "link_author": "BigBagZiv", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j3xq2hw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "bamspoozle", "num_comments": 144, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j3wx136", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_g3d6w", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 1, "body": "Hench is a weird one.
