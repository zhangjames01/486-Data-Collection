It is not fair to anyone that men are assigned roles are protectors/warriors/etc. while women were assigned roles as chattel/caregivers/etc. I am hard-pressed to see how women &lt;em&gt;benefitted&lt;/em&gt; from that status, unless you count &amp;quot;being treated as an object and barred from difficult/dangerous tasks&amp;quot; as a benefit, which is not a benefit when it comes from a patronizing, &amp;quot;no, sweetheart, let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; handle that&amp;quot; position. Any &amp;quot;advantage&amp;quot; stemming from systemic oppression is not an advantage, but an extension of that oppression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to equate oppression of women with LGBTQ+ or any other type of oppression. We all agree that LGBTQ+ people have been shit on by pretty much all of history, but playing &amp;quot;who has it worse????&amp;quot; is a lose-lose situation. Stirring up that particular shitstorm was not my intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also not sure what you&amp;#39;re saying with the last sentence. I was arguing that we can&amp;#39;t take every social movement and put them together, but not that there aren&amp;#39;t connections between them. Most oppression has stemmed from the same source-the assumption that the white, heterosexual male was king, all other people to the left. For that reason, these movements can &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; from cooperating, which is why most modern feminists side-eye the shit out of anyone claiming to be a feminist but ignoring everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1hw1yk", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hw1yk/its_completely_counter_intuitive/cayod8c/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hw1yk/its_completely_counter_intuitive/", "name": "t1_cayod8c", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AdviceAnimals", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1373338359.0, "created_utc": 1373338359.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://imgur.com/n6iyGqL"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Its completely counter intuitive", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 67, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "caymyrg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "ImStillAwesome", "num_comments": 901, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_caymg97", "score": 67, "author_fullname": "t2_5eqb1", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "While I agree that men shouldn't necessarily be raked over the coals for the existence of the patriarchy, I think it's vital that they admit it exists and that they are benefitting from it.
