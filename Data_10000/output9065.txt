There's many of us who have been to this dark place. My wife suffered, was hospitalized for weeks after a flare up. Her initial entyvio dose didn't have enough pre-med, and she even had a severe reaction and had to be hospitalized on her first infusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I can say is that:\n\n1) Entyvio is a great, powerful drug, and you want to try to stay on this compared to others if you can tolerate it\n\n2) Aggressively read medical journals, and manage your diet strictly. For my wife, there's a pretty summarized list of trigger foods for her: most of the foods in the ragweed pollen category (Banana. Cantaloupe. Cucumber. Honeydew. Watermelon.White potato. Zucchini, Sunflower seeds.), along with raw salad, raw tomatoes, lactose-containing foods, and high flour content (ie not too much noodles/pasta, roughly 50-75% of the normal serving size that others of her size would eat is the max max she should ever go to). There are many GI docs who claim food and a bunch of other stuff are non factors. GI and many doctors have very little responsibility to society after graduating - as I'm sure any IBD/crohn's sufferer is aware having most of their tummy pains dismissed by doctors for their entire lives. \n\n3) Stress and anxiety - meditate often, and get physical exercise. You may need some motivation podcasts, but carve time to be outside every day, and walk around. You want sunlight and fresh air. You want to listen to a lot of podcasts - my wife is always listening to something to manage anxiety. If you have any favorite tv shows, download them and have them play in the background when you're doing tasks. Familiar shows, familiar episodes can help you feel more in your element at ease during day-to-day tasks.\n\n4) Start looking into some of the more exploratory theories, specifically having to do with light, water and magnestism (I know, sounds like hocus pocus) but [I'll give you a link here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6859693/) Long story short: reduce blue light at night, increase red light at night, and expose your body/abdomen to as much as sunlight as you can.

You came to the right place. There are many very nice and generous folks here - and unlike many other groups where people have self-diagnosed themselves and tell fictitious stories, just about every person in here has been hospitalized, been or fought for a diagnosis, gone through the entire difficult process of getting on a good med and managing their life. At least, you have been able to get on entyvio as a first med - this is a solid step. how did you manage this? Are you in the USA? Entyvio, for many people in the US, is specifically not allowed as a first treatment as it is so expensive. The manual for insurance companies specifically state that you have to fail alternative methods of treatment before being able to qualify for entyvio.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re in the right place. There&amp;#39;s many of us who have been to this dark place. My wife suffered, was hospitalized for weeks after a flare up. Her initial entyvio dose didn&amp;#39;t have enough pre-med, and she even had a severe reaction and had to be hospitalized on her first infusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I can say is that:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Entyvio is a great, powerful drug, and you want to try to stay on this compared to others if you can tolerate it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Aggressively read medical journals, and manage your diet strictly. For my wife, there&amp;#39;s a pretty summarized list of trigger foods for her: most of the foods in the ragweed pollen category (Banana. Cantaloupe. Cucumber. Honeydew. Watermelon.White potato. Zucchini, Sunflower seeds.), along with raw salad, raw tomatoes, lactose-containing foods, and high flour content (ie not too much noodles/pasta, roughly 50-75% of the normal serving size that others of her size would eat is the max max she should ever go to). There are many GI docs who claim food and a bunch of other stuff are non factors. GI and many doctors have very little responsibility to society after graduating - as I&amp;#39;m sure any IBD/crohn&amp;#39;s sufferer is aware having most of their tummy pains dismissed by doctors for their entire lives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Stress and anxiety - meditate often, and get physical exercise. You may need some motivation podcasts, but carve time to be outside every day, and walk around. You want sunlight and fresh air. You want to listen to a lot of podcasts - my wife is always listening to something to manage anxiety. If you have any favorite tv shows, download them and have them play in the background when you&amp;#39;re doing tasks.
