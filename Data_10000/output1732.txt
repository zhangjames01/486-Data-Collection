IMHO yes. I don't think there's anything to the story and the videos are garbage. The main promoters of the story appear to be promoting a hoax, maybe knowingly.

I have never even looked at the automod. I fail to see how you can know it won&amp;#39;t be changed at some point? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was busy manning a far more relevant and consequential forum that hasn&amp;#39;t fallen victim to feckless mods. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which one would that be? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;re not interested in moderating here because it is so bad, you should stop accessing the moderation tools, don&amp;#39;t you think? Isn&amp;#39;t your behaviour a tad hypocritical? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m unhappy that for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; users have complained to me that the modding at &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ufos/\"&gt;r/ufos&lt;/a&gt; is a shitshow. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The impression I get is that people who are prone to believe in hoaxes are complaining that their beliefs are no longer validated on this sub. I don&amp;#39;t see any rational arguments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I came on we were expressly asked to cut out the garbage. We did. These days we have solid, rational discussion to the point that actual UFO researchers, you know, the real ones, post here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing with conspiracy thinkers is, they actually want to believe that someone is in charge of things, even if it is some evil manipulator, because they don&amp;#39;t want to accept that everything is just random and not controlled by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have the moral high ground when you are rabble rousing on another sub and basically causing more drama. How can you imagine you have clean hands? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to speak from moral authority, unmod from the sub. It is totally hypocritical to take no part in the daily operation of the sub and then to barge in to interfere with the automod scripts and misrepresent the actions going on here, when you don&amp;#39;t even know what went on or who really did what. The only one abusing their power is you, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium":
