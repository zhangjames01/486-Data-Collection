As a 6th grader, I helped my mom earn her GED so she could apply for a job at Wal-Mart, where she worked for the next 27 years until she retired. I am the first person in my family to earn a degree. It was paid for mostly by a Wal-Mart scholarship which I competed against thousands of kids in east Texas and Louisiana to receive. \n\nMy degrees are in music performance (oboe) and all-level vocal education. Its a silly degree, but it did certainly open up doors for me that would not have been available without that piece of paper. I started playing organ at age 7 and flute in school band. I picked up guitar at 13 but quit before long because the teacher wanted me to sing and I was painfully shy. It gave me a foundation to pick up bass so I could join the high school jazz band, though. Playing bass and singing are how I made my living for years after college. \n\nI was date-raped at 17 and hid my shame and trauma over it for 10 years. Subsequently, the fear and internal brokenness that comes with that kind of secret caused me to make all sorts of horrible decisions in that time period, including marrying my abusive middle-school sweetheart (not the rapist - more like the devil you know vs a big scary world of raping men).\n\nWe moved to Nashville where we both made a good living playing and/or teaching music. He was on the road a lot, which helped us last as long as we did. I finally woke up, crawled out of my self-inflicted hell and divorced him at 29. He was savant talented. Sometimes I miss singing and playing music as we did together every single day. Although I would never re-pick them for myself, I do not regret the experiences of that marriage. They helped hone me into someone I really like. \n\nIn June of 2001 I moved to Columbus, Ohio for the summer to get my feet back under me by staying with extended family. 13 Years later, I'm still here (although no longer living with relatives). I continue to be surprised by how much I really like Columbus. \n\nI was working at a small regional airport on 9/11. I was meditating on my bed that morning when the first plane hit. I swear to you that I was shoved out of my meditation by a wave of energy that made me want to vomit for no known reason at the moment of impact. The day is forever etched into my memory. I still sob at the mere memory of it even though I didn't know a single person lost. \n\nI married a second guy who I was having a summer fling with a few years later. He was fun and funny and a good companion - the polar opposite of the 1st husband. We traveled to India together in November 2004. On Thanksgiving day we awoke to singing at 5am from a nearby mosque and our hearts were quiet and at peace in the dark stillness sipping instant coffee together. Later that day traveling from Agra to New Delhi, we watched a man take his dying breath in a pool of blood from an auto accident and understood what it really means to be thankful.\n\nHusband #2 turned out to have some pathological fidelity issues that were ultimately more important to him than our relationship. I accepted this about him but didn't pick it for myself, so we divorced. We are still friendly although rarely in contact. \n\nI drive a 2004 Kia. I used to drive a new BMW every 6-12 months until I was laid off from a job with golden handcuffs. The BMWs drove like butter. I like my Kia just fine. I'm hoping to be able to give it to my step-daughter when she starts driving in 2.5 years. \n\nMy friends call me the 'Whore of Babylon' because I think everyone old enough to live with the consequences of sexing should be fucking someone, regardless of relationship status (meaning that not having an SO does not equate to not having a sex partner). Also, after years of making my living on stage playing and singing, I am an indiscriminate flirt. I've had all of 22 partners since the age of 19 when I became sexually active. I have all of their names, the date we first had sex, and whether or not it was penetration sex or some other creative fun written in a diary with a fuzzy cover and a silver foil unicorn on the front that I've had since I was 13. I did this because my gay uncle died from AIDS when I was in college, and I wanted to make sure I could remember who the hell I'd been sexing if I ever *needed* to remember who I've been sexing. The list hasn't needed to be updated in 6 years. Apparently 22 is my lucky number. \n\nI suffer from chronic bitch face and have been told that I appear to be mean and unapproachable unless I'm actively making an effort to light my face up (yay performance background!).\n\nI had 9 pregnancies and 10 miscarriages over the course of 15 years and 3 marriages. The last one was twins, lost separately. (I haven't taken birth control pills since age 20 - they worked great for birth control since they altered my hormones to the point that I didn't even want to hold hands, let alone fuck anyone!) After 30 years of suffering through debilitating periods for no good reason, I finally found a doctor who performed an endometrial ablation and tubal ligation last summer. OMG BEST DECISION EVAR! I can now sex my favorite person as much as I want without ever having to worry about the heart-breaking consequences again.\n\nLucky for me, lucky #22 has 2 children from his 1st marriage. I've been in their lives since the teenager was 2 because their dad and I worked together and became business partners long before our divorces from our respective spouses. As I tell them often, I could not love those children more if they'd come out of my own hoo ha. \n\nWe have a dog and a cat and a business and week on / week off custody. It is amazing because we get to be a family for a week and then a couple for a week.\n\nI talk to my parents in Texas on the phone almost every day. They're in her mid-70s. The clock of their mortality ticks loudly in my ears on the days I don't call. Even though most of our conversations involve the same thing we talked about yesterday and the day before, they are sweet and I wouldn't trade their rambling repetitive sameness for anything but the ability to visit more often.\n\nAs for #22, he is my best friend. My moon and stars. Younger and less jaded than I (I am his #2), I get to experience things anew through his eyes. He accepts and even seems to appreciate the special brand of crazy that comes with my history, and he inspires me to want to be my best self. We are yin and yang and fit so perfectly together in everything that we do that I can now fully understand the concept of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Really. It all sounds trite. There are not words to convey the special level of awesome that we've found in ourselves with one another, even to our closest friends. There will never be enough days with him on this planet.\n\nTL;DR - 42 y/o female with chronic bitch face who seems to have lived 3 lives already, most of them traumatic, is insanely happy with how her life is turning out because loving herself frees her to love others and be loved in return.
