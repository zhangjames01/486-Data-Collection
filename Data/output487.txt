I'll give you a bullet point summary, rounded to centuries/eras to keep things simple.\n\n*  Around 2100 Earth develops the protium fusion reactor and the Kearny-Fuchida Drive (also known as the K-F drive) which enables faster than light travel and coupled with cheap, accessible energy, humanity rapidly colonizes nearby solar systems.\n\n* Around 2200 the colonies revolt against the oppressive Terran Alliance, where the colonies further than 1 jump (30 light years) were able to break free.\n\n* Around 2300 the terran alliance corruption lead to a civil war, with Admiral James McKenna conducting a coup and forming the terran hegemony. The expansion/aggression of the hegemony against the former colonies lead to the colonies establishing defense treaties or outright conquering their neighbors to counter the terran hegemony. These efforts eventually snowballed into the creation of the great houses of the inner sphere.\n\n* In 2400 the conflicts between the terran hegemony, the great houses and smaller regional powers began what's referred to as \"the age of war\". At this point in history, faster than light travel is possible, but faster than light communication is not. So conflicts revolve around WarShips, massive K-F drive equipped starships that would drop into a system and proceed to either conquer or glass a planet from orbit. This caused a chain reaction of preemptive and retaliatory strikes, where habitable worlds were rendered radioactive wastelands. This gave rise to the Ares Convention, which limited orbital bombardment and promoted conventional arms. The battlemech was created in this era, and the Ares Convention is what made the battlemech the dominant war machine. It complied with the terms of the Ares Convention, but brought a level of firepower, flexibility, durability and ease of repair/salvage that hadn't been seen before on the battlefield.\n\n* 2600 formation of the Star League and the HPG network. The Terran Hegemony, through technologically advantage, military might and diplomacy managed to form an interstellar coalition with the Great Houses called the Star League. The Star League is ruled by the Cameron line and managed to usher in what many consider the zenith of human civilization. This dovetails with the Hyperpulse Generator Network (HPG), Where ftl communication becomes possible.\n\n* Late 2700's While the Stat League Defense force is fighting on the outer rim, Stephan Amaris stages a coup on Earth and assassinates the entire Cameron line. Kerensky, the General in charge of the SLDF, refuses to accept Amaris and wages a war against those that pledged to Amaris, beginning in the outer rim and finishing on earth. Kerensky wins, but there's no clear leadership for the star League as the Great Houses can't agree. Rather than getting dragged into yet another war, Kerensky leaves Jerome Blake in charge of the HPG network and Earth and they agree that earth and the HPG network should remain neutral (along with a secret allotment of Star League weapons). The \"neutral\" organization Blake forms is named ComStar. Kerensky then takes the SLDF into deep space to form new colonies. This proceeds to kick off the first succession war.\n\n* 2800-2900 Succession wars 1 and 2. House Kurita kicks off the succession wars and all the great houses join in. WarShips dropping in and laying waste to entire planets. Wholesale destruction of research facilities, orbital manufacturing plants and entire cities dedicated to manufacturing. The manufacturing and material losses over the next century were so great that technology regressed several centuries.\n\n* 2900-3025 Third succession war. Things have cooled down, mostly because there's really no WarShip fleets remaining and the great houses are more reluctant to commit their armies. Mercenary Companies have grown in importance, as they provide access to battlemechs in significant numbers to worlds that lack the ability to field and maintain them.
