The benefits of undergoing a contrast MRI far, far outweighed the risks for me, and allowed me to not only get my venous sinus stenosis diagnosed, but also treated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would suggest voicing your concerns perhaps to &lt;a href=\"/r/radiology\"&gt;r/radiology&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"/r/mri\"&gt;r/mri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11uxlwg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/11uxlwg/has_your_experience_with_long_covid_changed_your/jctgy45/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/11uxlwg/has_your_experience_with_long_covid_changed_your/", "name": "t1_jctgy45", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/covidlonghaulers", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679231398.0, "created_utc": 1679231398.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/11uxlwg/has_your_experience_with_long_covid_changed_your/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wizt3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Has your experience with Long Covid changed your opinion of doctors/healthcare in general?

No regrets. I am no longer in research/academia, but I do work in Government in a field directly related to my PhD, and was fortunate enough to land this position in Adelaide thanks to remote-working. Marine biology is a broad field and it is going to depend *heavily* about which ecosystem you wish to work in. I really enjoyed being at Flinders but I went through a uni-wide restructure which was pretty tough. Thankfully that has settled down now and it appears Adelaide Uni/UniSA are going to go through something similar, so something to keep in mind. Also Flinders tends to do more of the boat work, Adelaide Uni tends to do more of the diving work. \n\nIf you wish to work in temperate ecosystems, Flinders and Adelaide Uni are both good here, along with Uni WA if you ever head west. If you wish to work in polar seas, UTAS is best. JCU and some of the Sydney Unis for your tropical and subtropical work. \n\nAs people have noted, it isn't a field that is brimming with jobs and is exceptionally competitive. You *will* have to do Honours afterwards, and possibly even a PhD (Masters maybe) to get a foot in the door, even for non-academic jobs or for long-term career progression. I work in Government now and even so, nearly everyone in my team has a Masters or PhD, even though the minimum Degree required was just a Bachelors for non-academic work. Academia is pretty tough in all fields, so have a back-up plan in place if staying in research long-term (i.e., postdoc and beyond), because statistically you will be an adjunct for a long time. That's a global academia problem in nearly every single field.\n\n I did environmental marine consulting for a bit before I joined Government. There is also SARDI, PIRSA and DEW, other local, state and federal government agencies, some of the NGOs (i.e., Nature Conservancy), environmental consultancies, education and outreach, ecotourism, and natural resource management (i.e., fisheries and aquaculture) in terms of job opportunities if you don't stay at the research institutions long-term. \n\nMarine biology is also a science, so be prepared to do science. That is, a lot of experimental design, statistics, and even programming. Writing scientific papers, presenting at conferences, obtaining grants. The fun field and lab work is only a very small part of the job. if you want to be SCUBA-diving all the time; this is not the career path to choose (go be a SCUBA instructor instead).

I really enjoyed being at Flinders but I went through a uni-wide restructure which was pretty tough. Thankfully that has settled down now and it appears Adelaide Uni/UniSA are going to go through something similar, so something to keep in mind. Also Flinders tends to do more of the boat work, Adelaide Uni tends to do more of the diving work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you wish to work in temperate ecosystems, Flinders and Adelaide Uni are both good here, along with Uni WA if you ever head west. If you wish to work in polar seas, UTAS is best. JCU and some of the Sydney Unis for your tropical and subtropical work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As people have noted, it isn&amp;#39;t a field that is brimming with jobs and is exceptionally competitive. You &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have to do Honours afterwards, and possibly even a PhD (Masters maybe) to get a foot in the door, even for non-academic jobs or for long-term career progression. I work in Government now and even so, nearly everyone in my team has a Masters or PhD, even though the minimum Degree required was just a Bachelors for non-academic work. Academia is pretty tough in all fields, so have a back-up plan in place if staying in research long-term (i.e., postdoc and beyond), because statistically you will be an adjunct for a long time. That&amp;#39;s a global academia problem in nearly every single field.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did environmental marine consulting for a bit before I joined Government. There is also SARDI, PIRSA and DEW, other local, state and federal government agencies, some of the NGOs (i.e., Nature Conservancy), environmental consultancies, education and outreach, ecotourism, and natural resource management (i.e., fisheries and aquaculture) in terms of job opportunities if you don&amp;#39;t stay at the research institutions long-term. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marine biology is also a science, so be prepared to do science. That is, a lot of experimental design, statistics, and even programming. Writing scientific papers, presenting at conferences, obtaining grants. The fun field and lab work is only a very small part of the job. if you want to be SCUBA-diving all the time; this is not the career path to choose (go be a SCUBA instructor instead). But I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had it any other way and I loved my time at Flinders. All the best!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11tnnhy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Adelaide/comments/11tnnhy/anyone_have_any_experience_studying_marine/jcnnap7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/11tnnhy/anyone_have_any_experience_studying_marine/", "name": "t1_jcnnap7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Adelaide", "author_flair_text": "SA", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679110880.0, "created_utc": 1679110880.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/11tnnhy/anyone_have_any_experience_studying_marine/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_6zlggw", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom X Avatar: The Last Airbender (credits to @himawarrior on Twitter)", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "tearsofthekingdom", "link_author": "huzuhu_10", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcjiufv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Neyface", "num_comments": 15, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcfpr2g", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6q469", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "BRB calling guardians \"sparky sparky boom men.\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRB calling guardians &amp;quot;sparky sparky boom men.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11stjrb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/11stjrb/the_legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom_x_avatar/jcjiufv/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/11stjrb/the_legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom_x_avatar/", "name": "t1_jcjiufv", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tearsofthekingdom", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679041075.0, "created_utc": 1679041075.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/11stjrb"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2saf4", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Potential start of long term visual snow?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "tinnitus", "link_author": "EmergencyEgg101", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcc01mq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Neyface", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcbxwk8", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_6q469", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yep.
