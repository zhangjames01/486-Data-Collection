That is a wild misinterpretation of the law. Moreover, the Canadian Human Rights Act only has force in the federal jurisdiction (which is relatively limited) and the fear-mongering he engaged in hadn't applied to him or anyone else when the very same standards were applied provincially in Ontario. He cited an incident that happened at a university in Ontario as validating his arguments at the outset when the ultimate outcome is that he was not only proven wrong but the law had no force at Ontario universities.\n\nTo the extent that respecting someone's pronouns is concerned, it's no more compelled speech than when people use the term \"African American\" in lieu of \"black person\" or, worse, a slur. There's myriad analogous situations, but even assuming the law would apply \"compelled speech\" amendments to federal jurisdiction, the Ontario Human Rights Code would have already enforced this standard back when gender identity was included into its text in 2012. So if he was concerned about encroachments on freedom of expression and compelled speech, he was several years too late to influence his freedoms as an academic. Moreover, as gender identity had been read under sex in several precedent setting cases, it was more an amendment that reaffirmed the precedents already set.\n\nTo cap that off, the human rights laws in Canada largely present a strictly civil claim. The exception is criminal offences falling under the umbrella of hate speech (which is rarely enforced and ample opportunities are generally afforded to prevent any sort of sentencing). C-16 wasn't what he portrayed it to be, he was already subject to stricter standards under provincial legislation, etc. \n\nThe bulk of what he had to say was off the mark and rooted in fear-mongering. There are ways to avoid pronoun use other than adopting neologisms as some have.

That is a wild misinterpretation of the law. Moreover, the Canadian Human Rights Act only has force in the federal jurisdiction (which is relatively limited) and the fear-mongering he engaged in hadn&amp;#39;t applied to him or anyone else when the very same standards were applied provincially in Ontario. He cited an incident that happened at a university in Ontario as validating his arguments at the outset when the ultimate outcome is that he was not only proven wrong but the law had no force at Ontario universities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the extent that respecting someone&amp;#39;s pronouns is concerned, it&amp;#39;s no more compelled speech than when people use the term &amp;quot;African American&amp;quot; in lieu of &amp;quot;black person&amp;quot; or, worse, a slur. There&amp;#39;s myriad analogous situations, but even assuming the law would apply &amp;quot;compelled speech&amp;quot; amendments to federal jurisdiction, the Ontario Human Rights Code would have already enforced this standard back when gender identity was included into its text in 2012. So if he was concerned about encroachments on freedom of expression and compelled speech, he was several years too late to influence his freedoms as an academic. Moreover, as gender identity had been read under sex in several precedent setting cases, it was more an amendment that reaffirmed the precedents already set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To cap that off, the human rights laws in Canada largely present a strictly civil claim. The exception is criminal offences falling under the umbrella of hate speech (which is rarely enforced and ample opportunities are generally afforded to prevent any sort of sentencing).
