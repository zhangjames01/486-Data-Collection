You&amp;#39;re almost there!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One way to REALLY see regrowth (if your hair is long enough and you haven&amp;#39;t gotten it cut since the re-growth started) is gently pull/hold back the hair at your hairline (your hand should be a couple inches behind your hairline holding your hair back) then with the opposite hand/fingers tease the hair between your hairline and your hand in the opposite direction (so toward your forehead). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll prob see a couple or a bunch of shorter hairs come out from your hairline. This is all new hair growth! It may still be a little early to see it but do not worry your hair is growing back! You&amp;#39;re almost there my friends!
