On psvr2 for example, the panel takes up 110 degrees of your field of vision. A typical pc monitor setup will be way less than that, probably at least half.  So your are going to lose a lot of tracking resolution. If say your eye tracking can distinguish eye position in 1 degree increments, that same 1 degree will be a lot more pixels on the desktop display vs a vr headset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then you have the problem in the opposite direction, the eye itself can see many more pixels in the desktop in focus, meaning the area of the display that must be rendered in high res is much higher, so your savings (the amount you can render in lower resolution) is going to be comparably lower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might end up in a situation where current variable res shading techniques already accomplish the majority of what foveated rendering would achieve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11dkwog", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/pcgaming/comments/11dkwog/do_you_think_that_desktop_eye_tracking_could_be/jab22kk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/11dkwog/do_you_think_that_desktop_eye_tracking_could_be/", "name": "t1_jab22kk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pcgaming", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677554766.0, "created_utc": 1677554766.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/11dkwog/do_you_think_that_desktop_eye_tracking_could_be/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfg", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "From Mindfactory data, the cost of a graphics card increased by a factor of two between 2020 and 2023", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "pcgaming", "link_author": "hpstg", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j9owlls", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ahnold11", "num_comments": 130, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j9l4i9k", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4zc6z", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Costs have gone up, I think I remember seeing maybe 15-25% rumoured.
