Passing off a counterfeit card as a real one with the intention of tricking someone out of their money is bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proxies aren&amp;#39;t meant to be passed off as real cards. Magic is an expensive game, and cEDH especially so. Many of the strongest cards in the format are on the reserved list, and many people aren&amp;#39;t able to afford putting the equivalent of a down payment on a house to purchase [[Gaea&amp;#39;s Cradle]], [[Mox Diamond]], [[The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale]], [[Timetwister]], all the ABUR duals, etc. just to get on an even playing field. &amp;quot;Play against the player, not their wallet&amp;quot; is a pretty common saying here, since the game can get pay-to-win really quickly if you don&amp;#39;t allow proxies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_wmjm03", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CompetitiveEDH/comments/wmjm03/tips_for_moving_into_cedh/ik1qply/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveEDH/comments/wmjm03/tips_for_moving_into_cedh/", "name": "t1_ik1qply", "author_flair_template_id": "2237413a-3fcf-11e3-bd1f-12313d184137", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CompetitiveEDH", "author_flair_text": "Plays Karador in [current year]", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1660339154.0, "created_utc": 1660339154.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveEDH/comments/wmjm03/tips_for_moving_into_cedh/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34o9s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How I see the USA as a Mexican starter pack", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "starterpacks", "link_author": "xJavier_Escuellax", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ijt8qpn", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Sakatsu_Dkon", "num_comments": 5474, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ijt0znb", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_8gb82", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; The problem is that the other side isnt willing to debate about at what age \u201cgender affirming care\u201d is even appropriate.\n\nThat's because *it's already been settled*.
