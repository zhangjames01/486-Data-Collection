Voting record wise she is to the left of sanders and technically Kamala was the senator with the most progressive voting record (though yes those are skewed statistics since they are newer senators they didn\u2019t have things like voting for the war on terror or the crime bill placed on their record like Bernie did which knocked him)\n\nEveryone just assumed she was bad for \u201cbetraying M4A\u201d, but I went and read her proposal and the \u201cbetrayal\u201d was splitting the M4A bill into 2 parts, a public option to be enacted immediately as a transition for 2 years, and then the full M4A to be pushed for in the much more democratically favored 2022 electoral map (which pre Covid and pre coup made sense as a strategy). Since it had the words public option in it everyone flipped and said she turned her back. Even though that is politically a very viable plan, messaging is one of Warren\u2019s major weaknesses. And a wonky but viable plan means Dick if you can\u2019t sell it.\n\nWhat made refuting this difficult was that, frustratingly but also smart politically, Sanders was very, very vague on *how* his agenda would be passed, similar to the Obama strategy. Sander\u2019s always just released \u201coptions\u201d so no one could attack him too hard for, say, raising taxes a huge percentage cause \u201cwell that\u2019s just one option we\u2019re looking at it\u2019s not something we are committed to\u201d was his usual reply. The reason I bring this up was one of these \u201coptions\u201d by sanders was a 4-6 phase in via a public option while the Medicare age was dropped by 10 every 2 years and paid for by a payroll tax. Warren\u2019s was a 2 year phase in paid fully by raising her wealth tax proposal from 2 to 6 percent. Policy wise, hers was more progressive, but combining her poor messaging, erratic campaign management direction, Sander\u2019s domination as essentially the incumbent for the de facto left wing, the petty grade school drama between her and Bernie that got blown up waaaaay too large, and her egregious doubly down of the Native American ancestry thing instead of admitting that she was told a lie as a kid and just went with it too hard, that is more than enough fuel on the fire to kill a campaign.\n\nAnyways, this is a very long winded way of saying; the 2020 field was actually much richer and much more nuanced than social media echo chamber made it out to be.

Voting record wise she is to the left of sanders and technically Kamala was the senator with the most progressive voting record (though yes those are skewed statistics since they are newer senators they didn\u2019t have things like voting for the war on terror or the crime bill placed on their record like Bernie did which knocked him)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone just assumed she was bad for \u201cbetraying M4A\u201d, but I went and read her proposal and the \u201cbetrayal\u201d was splitting the M4A bill into 2 parts, a public option to be enacted immediately as a transition for 2 years, and then the full M4A to be pushed for in the much more democratically favored 2022 electoral map (which pre Covid and pre coup made sense as a strategy). Since it had the words public option in it everyone flipped and said she turned her back. Even though that is politically a very viable plan, messaging is one of Warren\u2019s major weaknesses. And a wonky but viable plan means Dick if you can\u2019t sell it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What made refuting this difficult was that, frustratingly but also smart politically, Sanders was very, very vague on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; his agenda would be passed, similar to the Obama strategy. Sander\u2019s always just released \u201coptions\u201d so no one could attack him too hard for, say, raising taxes a huge percentage cause \u201cwell that\u2019s just one option we\u2019re looking at it\u2019s not something we are committed to\u201d was his usual reply. The reason I bring this up was one of these \u201coptions\u201d by sanders was a 4-6 phase in via a public option while the Medicare age was dropped by 10 every 2 years and paid for by a payroll tax. Warren\u2019s was a 2 year phase in paid fully by raising her wealth tax proposal from 2 to 6 percent. Policy wise, hers was more progressive, but combining her poor messaging, erratic campaign management direction, Sander\u2019s domination as essentially the incumbent for the de facto left wing, the petty grade school drama between her and Bernie that got blown up waaaaay too large, and her egregious doubly down of the Native American ancestry thing instead of admitting that she was told a lie as a kid and just went with it too hard, that is more than enough fuel on the fire to kill a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this is a very long winded way of saying; the 2020 field was actually much richer and much more nuanced than social media echo chamber made it out to be.
