Again, this is complicated and nuanced and this is just a bare-bones basic explanation, but take two of the most popular examples of satire, Weird Al and Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nWeird Al doesn't legally need permission to make his songs because they are transformative. He may be playing the same musical composition, but he has made his own arrangement, performed it himself (or with his band anyway), and changed the lyrics to fit. He DOES need permission to do his polka medley covers.\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000 simply adding commentary to the film is not considered transformative even though they are both reviewing the film through the commentary and satirizing it. That's why there's so many \"lost episodes\" of the show as the licenses lapsed and they couldn't officially release them, and why RiffTrax releases JUST the commentary as an audio file and you have to go find the movie yourself. The times RiffTrax does release the movie with commentary, it's either public domain or they have secured a license.\n\nNow when I say this is nuanced, it is because there is no clear legal definition of what is considered \"transformative\" for Fair Use. It's left pretty much up to the discretion of the judge (typically these sort of cases don't go to a jury trial) and it's up to the lawyers to present their cases as to why the work is or is not transformative enough to be covered under fair use.\n\nAlso, I want to point out that \"Fair Use\" is what's called an affirmative defense. It means you're admitting that you did whatever you're being sued for but it was legal. If your only defense is Fair Use and that defense fails, you have lost the case about as badly as you could because, by using Fair Use, you have stated that what you did was a violation of copyright but just happened to be a LEGAL violation. If the judge and/or jury disagree, you've just admitted fault. This is why most IP lawsuits for infringement are structured more along the lines of a legalese version of \"Here's the laundry list of reasons why this isn't infringement, but even if it were infringement (which it's not), here's the argument for why the infringement would be covered under Fair Use (which it isn't infringement but just in case)\".", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parody and satire is considered fair use because it is transformative, meaning that a &amp;quot;new work&amp;quot; is created through the use of parody/satire.

He may be playing the same musical composition, but he has made his own arrangement, performed it himself (or with his band anyway), and changed the lyrics to fit. He DOES need permission to do his polka medley covers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mystery Science Theater 3000 simply adding commentary to the film is not considered transformative even though they are both reviewing the film through the commentary and satirizing it.

However, I can't sue over trademark infringement because I am not the only person with a license to use McDonald's trademarks. However, if I got a license from McDonald's to create toys based on their trademarks (Ronald McDonald, Grimace, Hamburglar, etc.), I still couldn't file a trademark lawsuit if another restaurant called themselves \"McDonald's Diner\" or something, but I could sue if someone else started making toys that violated the trademark if I was granted enforcement authority in the license from McDonald's.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't matter if CGL can or can't sue in this case because nothing they've done is considered legal action. They have not sent a Cease &amp; Desist order, they haven't filed a lawsuit, they weren't involved in arbitration, all they did was contact Vivas and explain the concerns of the rights holder.
