It&amp;#39;s socketed in a K1SPE motherboard and running Windows 11 Pro for Workstations. Initially Windows bitched about some compatibility nonsense but I was able to sidestep that using Rufus and an external SSD. After that it ran very smoothly, and I actually did the development in Visual Studio on the Phi system. I think the Phi/K1SPE CPU+motherboard combos are still available on eBay if you&amp;#39;re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The recording of Task Manager CPU utilization is 100% real, but I have to confess that it is sped up. This is not actually because of any hardware limitation, it&amp;#39;s the averaging period in Task Manager. If I scroll the marquee too fast, then the motion blur makes it impossible to make out the text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was inspired to do this &lt;a href=\"https://bitsum.com/general/the-64-core-threshold-processor-groups-and-windows/\"&gt;after reading that Windows 11 had finally done away with processor groups&lt;/a&gt; (which were an ugly hack to allow &amp;gt;64 processor systems stemming from the ancient decision to make thread processor affinity a bit vector, since 64+ processor systems were unthinkable at the time). Originally I&amp;#39;d planned to do this using MPI, since the OpenMPI reference implementation actually uses busy-wait by default. I figured I could get it done in 20 lines of code. Microsoft had other plans for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, the MSMPI implementation doesn&amp;#39;t use busy-wait. This is a questionable design decision in the first place because MPI is intended mainly for HPC enviroments where the program in question should be the primary workload, and time spent context switching is a lot worse than time spent busy-waiting. Anyway, the threads sleep on wait, so it was necessary for me to add my own no-op busy loop. But the coup de grace was that the whole Windows 11 processor group revamp broke the affinity / processor pinning for MSMPI, so I couldn&amp;#39;t pin the threads to individual processors no matter what I tried. In the end I had to spawn the threads and assign affinity myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Microsoft sucks, rabble rabble rabble.
