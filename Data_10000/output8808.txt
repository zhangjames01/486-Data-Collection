About 2\u00bd weeks after that breakup, she went to visit a former business partner of McFadden\u2019s one evening, and McFadden suddenly started calling and texting the man, asking why he was with her, a police search warrant document says.\n\n\u201cShe stated that (the male friend) was frightened by this, so she decided to go home,\u201d the document says. \u201cWhen she left\u2026 she saw McFadden in a red truck parked near the man\u2019s residence. (She) said he followed her for approximately one mile and turned around.\u201d\n\nLater, McFadden returned to the man\u2019s house to confront him, according to police.\n\nThe woman realized then that McFadden had to have been tracking her with some sort of GPS device. But she searched her car and couldn\u2019t find one, according to the warrant.\n\nOn Dec. 31, the woman told police, McFadden\u2019s close friend Allen showed up at Paws and Pints, a large dog park and bar on 63rd Street on Des Moines\u2019 west side, where she had gone to meet another male friend. She later told police Allen had stood across the park staring at her, talking on his cellphone the entire time.\n\nAfter that incident, McFadden sent the ex-girlfriend flowers, the search warrant document says.\n\nSearching her car again, the woman found a small Invoxia real-time tracking device hidden in the seat pocket behind the passenger seat, the document said.\n\nThe woman told investigators McFadden also had sent her harassing messages, and that she had tried to block his phone number. But he had an app on his phone that would cause her phone's call log to show another number, enabling him to keep getting through to her, the document said.\n\nOn Dec. 31, in coordination with a plan by police, the woman parked her vehicle at the Ankeny Residence Inn with the still-active GPS device inside. Police instructed the hotel staff to notify them if anyone inquired about her being there.\n\nThe front desk clerk called police the next day and said a man had called looking for the woman. When she said no woman with that name was registered there, the caller inquired about whether McFadden's former business partner was there, and she told him the hotel had no guest by that name either. The number the call was placed from tracked to one McFadden used, the search warrant document said.\n\nMcFadden was subsequently charged with one count of stalking, an aggravated misdemeanor, and five counts of stalking with unauthorized use of GPS, serious misdemeanors. Allen was charged with one count of stalking, an aggravated misdemeanor, and third-degree harassment, a simple misdemeanor.\n\nBack in 2015, when McFadden's then-wife Trisha filed for divorce, she obtained a restraining order after filing a petition seeking relief from domestic violence, outlining several instances when he allegedly choked her, assaulted her and threatened to kill her, court documents show. Once, Trisha McFadden wrote in a statement for the court, he choked her on New Year's Eve in front of their two daughters while she was six months pregnant. He does not appear to have faced charges over these allegations.\n\nTrisha McFadden did not return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nThat same year, he was charged with first-degree harassment for allegedly threatening the life of a man who visited Trisha McFadden at their home, court records show. Steve McFadden threatened the man with a baseball bat and told him never to come to the house again, police claimed. He pleaded guilty to third-degree harassment, a simple misdemeanor, and served no jail time.\n\nMcFadden\u2019s arrest in January of this year on the six stalking counts garnered fresh criticism against him on social media. The criticism escalated after Allen was charged with allegedly helping stalk and harass McFadden\u2019s former girlfriend.\n\nTrever Hook, one of McFadden\u2019s attorneys, successfully represented Allen in a 2021 incident after Allen was accused of harassing his own ex-wife. He was found not guilty by a jury in May 2022, court records show.\n\nA landlord and property manager, Allen also was charged last year after allegedly terrifying a woman and her two kids, ages 12 and 8, by banging on their door and yelling at the children to let him come in when the woman wasn\u2019t home. Devolder, his attorney, said Allen pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment. Court records do not indicate the sentence.\n\nIn another case set to go to trial at the end of February, Allen was accused of second-degree harassment for allegedly yelling racial slurs and other derogatory comments over the phone at the daughter of one of his tenants. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHook and Kutmus will represent McFadden when he is arraigned in the stalking case in early March.\n\nAllen tried to have details of his harassment and stalking cases hidden on Iowa's online court system for security reasons, saying he and his family had received death threats because of the case. Judge Becky Goettsch denied that request and ordered him to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet while on supervised pretrial release. Among other reasons, the judge said, the monitoring was necessary because of the nature of the charges against him, his record, and public safety concerns, court documents show.\n\nReached by phone, the woman in the stalking case declined to make any public comments, saying she wanted to lay low while the case goes through the justice system.\n\nWhile McFadden's and Allen's new criminal cases play out, Davis' lawyer, Shannon Archer, has been trying to get McFadden's protective order against Davis lifted. Kutmus said his client wants the protective order to remain intact.\n\nArcher, who specializes in domestic violence cases, is a former assistant Polk County attorney who handled the 2021 assault case against McFadden. Now in private practice, she said, she's concerned that across the nation, too many men use tools like restraining orders and other court maneuvers to control their victims and make themselves look innocent.\n\nTiffany Allison, a victim of domestic violence who has been an advocate for Davis in her court case, said many people in the court system don\u2019t really understand the landscape of domestic violence \u2015 how someone can go from Prince Charming to a monster \u2015 or how lethal cases sometimes can get.\n\nThe founder of a nonprofit called the Soaring Hearts Foundation, Allison said a lethality assessment should be done on offenders, and victims should be notified if that individual is in the same proximity.\n\nNo such assessment was given to McFadden. Iowa doesn't require them, though some other states do, Allison said.\n\nLegislation that would make assessments mandatory passed unanimously in the Iowa Senate in 2018 but failed to advance further. Allison said advocates are looking for a lawmaker to sponsor legislation requiring assessments and GPS tracking for dangerous offenders, at the offenders' own expense.\n\nIn the latest stalking case, only Allen has been put on GPS monitoring so far, court records show.\n\n\u201cWas probation meaningful for an offender of this caliber?\u201d Allison asked of McFadden. \u201cOr did we just slap him on the wrist again and allow him to victimize someone else?\u201d\n\nAs for Davis' behavior, Allison said, it's fairly common for abused women to let offenders back in their lives.\n\n\"When you first go dark from somebody, that is so scary,\" she said. \"It\u2019s normal to allow contact because they are trying to navigate their own safety. ..

And now some advocates are questioning whether Iowa's court system is doing enough to protect victims of abuse.\n\nMcFadden maintained his innocence before and after his conviction last year on a single misdemeanor count of assault causing injury to Davis. He received a deferred judgment, which meant his conviction was expunged after he successfully completed his probation. He declined to comment through his attorneys.\n\nWilliam Kutmus, one of two attorneys representing McFadden in the stalking case, said he will address any allegations against McFadden in the courtroom and that it would be a violation of his ethics as a lawyer to do otherwise. \"You're relying on whoever you talk to,\" he said, calling some allegations against McFadden silly gossip. \"We take the position that the proper forum for Steve's rebuttal is where testimony is taken under oath and subjects them to perjury.\"\n\n\u201c I called Davis and she told me she suffered bruises and scratches, to the back of her head, bruised left elbow, bruises on her back and her left knee. During my phone conversation with Davis, she stated Macfadden entered the room to pick up his belongings to go to a different hotel. Davis said she was locked outside the room while McFadden was picking up his belongings. David said after McFadden left the hotel she went into the room and her purse was missing. On the mail in report, Davis said her purse was worth over $1,000.00, and contained a debit card, a Dior wallet worth over $600.00, her passport, $500.00 in cash and her car/apartment keys. Davis stated the cost of replacing her passport was $250.00 and the cost to replace her keys was $900.00.\u201d\n\nAn excerpt from the report a Key West, Florida, police officer wrote after Victoria Davis alleged Steve McFadden assaulted her during a trip they made together there this past New Year's Eve. No charges have been filed against McFadden.\nKey West Police Department\n\n\nMcFadden's arraignment in the stalking case is set for March 2. He has not yet entered a formal plea. Allen's lawyer, Steven Devolder, said Allen denies committing any offense and is pleading not guilty.\n\n'I remember all of it,' Victoria Davis wrote in a victim's statement about a July 2021 beating\n\nIn a written victim's statement given to a judge before McFadden's sentencing in the assault case last year, Davis, now 26, wrote that McFadden was charming when they started dating, wowing her with \"love bombs\" and gifts. A then-22-year-old waitress at the Grumpy Goat Tavern, one of several establishments he owns, she said he took her on trips to places like Mexico and Jamaica, and she told Watchdog that he had been her best friend.\n\nBut Davis also wrote in her statement that McFadden, whose properties also include Fat Charlie\u2019s, Boomers Bicycle Lounge, Tipsy Crow and Dough Mama Pizza, began physically abusing her after less than a year of dating. She wrote that during one fight after she'd accused him of cheating on her, \u201cYou punched me in the face \u2026 and when I cried about it in the morning, you said, \u2018You're lucky that's all that happened to you.\u2019 I wish that that was as bad as it got.\u201d\n\nDavis acknowledged in her statement the lengths to which she blamed herself for the way McFadden treated her, saying she felt damaged, used, isolated, lost and confused. His rejection, she said, often left her begging for him to treat her better.\n\nBut on the night they fought in July 2021, she wrote, his eyes went black. Davis alleged in the statement that after choking her to the point of unconsciousness and dragging her by the hair to the top of a staircase, he threw her down the stairs, then kicked her in the stomach so hard she passed out again.\n\nOnly after she\u2019d quit breathing, she wrote in her statement, did he halt the beating and try to give her CPR.\n\n\u201cI remember all of it,\u201d she wrote, addressing McFadden. \u201cI never saw you the same after that.\u201d\n\nMcFadden and his attorney denied this assault happened as Davis described; she said she nearly died, and memories of his angry face over hers still flood her nightmares.\n\nSteve McFadden becomes social media target\n\nBy the time McFadden was charged with felony assault in 2021, he had already become controversial in Des Moines' close-knit service industry and other circles. Drawing wide attention in 2017 was his imposition of a dress code at his Tipsy Crow tavern banning clothing such as baggy jeans, plain T-shirts and construction boots \u2015 a rule critics said targeted young Black men. McFadden, citing the closure of a nearby bar that had been the scene of several incidents, said he was just trying to keep his patrons safe.\n\nIn early 2022, he took what\u2019s called an Alford plea in his criminal case with Davis, admitting no guilt but acknowledging there was enough evidence to convict him at trial. The count to which he entered the plea was a misdemeanor, and he was ordered to serve a year on probation.\n\nAfter completing a six-week domestic abuse program later that year, he was released from probation and, under the deferred judgment, the conviction was removed from his record.\n\nThe same year, two salespeople in one of his ventures, a drink truck called Morning Wood Bloody Mary, sued in a still-pending civil case, alleging his company had failed to pay commissions. Also in 2022, McFadden filed 11 defamation lawsuits against people who had criticized him online. His attorney in those cases, David Leitner, said in a July interviewthat the online criticism had negatively impacted McFadden's businesses and caused him \"substantial emotional turmoil.\"\n\nIn the interview, Leitner maintained it's defamatory for critics to call McFadden a domestic abuser.\n\n\"The mere fact he pleaded guilty without admitting a thing isn't an admission of anything,\" Leitner said. \"You can't always rely on such things. If you're going to go around saying terrible things about somebody, you have some obligation to find out if it's true.\"\n\nThe lawsuits said defendants had defamed McFadden and attempted \"to cause him harm in his business.\" But while the lawsuits provided a time frame for the alleged behavior, they did not specify the statements the defendants allegedly made.\n\nDavis said she paid a hefty price for her relationship with McFadden. Now living in Omaha, Nebraska, she said she's been diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress syndrome and has suffered with frequent anxiety and sleeplessness. She said she also lost two of her oldest friends and strained her ties with her mother. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t associate with me because of the relationship,\u201d she said.\n\nDavis files police report in Key West\n\nDavis said she had no idea when she flew to Florida on Dec. 30 with McFadden \u2015she violating the protective order he had against her, and he, his own \u2015 that Ankeny police were investigating new allegations he was stalking his latest ex-girlfriend with Allen's help.\n\nAll she knew is that she found herself again wishing, against all odds, that maybe New Year's in Florida would be a good thing.\n\nDavis said she does not want to make public details of some interactions with McFadden for legal reasons. But she said their fight began after a night of partying on the evening of New Year\u2019s Day at the breezy Paradise Inn Hotel in Key West. Like other arguments they'd had, she said, it started over another woman.\n\nIn the complaint taken by a police officer and obtained by the Register, Davis told police that at 2:30 a.m. Jan. 2 in the hallway of their hotel suite, McFadden grabbed her by the back of the head and hit her in the face, causing a bruised right eye and a nosebleed. Their altercation, she alleged in the report. left bruising on her body and her hair extensions ripped from her head.\n\nThe report said police tried without success to contact McFadden for his side of the story. No charges have been filed against him, according to Key West police.\n\nWhat happened was eerily similar, Davis said, to their worst night, after a breakup, in July 2021 at his posh West Des Moines home \u2015 now on the market for $3.2 million.\n\nDavis, according to the police report, said that after the New Year's fight, McFadden locked her out of a bedroom in their suite while he packed to go to another hotel. She alleged he took her Louis Vuitton purse, her Dior wallet, her keys, her money and her passport, leaving only her identification for her to fly home with.\n\nShe said she ended up the next day on the plane with him, largely in silence. When they touched down in Des Moines, they both were arrested and jailed on contempt charges for violating the no-contact orders. Davis was released after a day, and the charge against her was dropped.\n\nMcFadden, also briefly held, was additionally charged in the stalking case.\n\nNot long after Davis was released, she lost her well-paying job in Omaha, where she\u2019d moved last year, adding to her troubles.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis said she knew she shouldn&amp;#39;t go, that everything in their tumultuous history suggested the trip was a horrible idea.

And now some advocates are questioning whether Iowa&amp;#39;s court system is doing enough to protect victims of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;McFadden maintained his innocence before and after his conviction last year on a single misdemeanor count of assault causing injury to Davis. He received a deferred judgment, which meant his conviction was expunged after he successfully completed his probation. He declined to comment through his attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;William Kutmus, one of two attorneys representing McFadden in the stalking case, said he will address any allegations against McFadden in the courtroom and that it would be a violation of his ethics as a lawyer to do otherwise. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re relying on whoever you talk to,&amp;quot; he said, calling some allegations against McFadden silly gossip. &amp;quot;We take the position that the proper forum for Steve&amp;#39;s rebuttal is where testimony is taken under oath and subjects them to perjury.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c I called Davis and she told me she suffered bruises and scratches, to the back of her head, bruised left elbow, bruises on her back and her left knee. During my phone conversation with Davis, she stated Macfadden entered the room to pick up his belongings to go to a different hotel. Davis said she was locked outside the room while McFadden was picking up his belongings. David said after McFadden left the hotel she went into the room and her purse was missing. On the mail in report, Davis said her purse was worth over $1,000.00, and contained a debit card, a Dior wallet worth over $600.00, her passport, $500.00 in cash and her car/apartment keys. Davis stated the cost of replacing her passport was $250.00 and the cost to replace her keys was $900.00.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An excerpt from the report a Key West, Florida, police officer wrote after Victoria Davis alleged Steve McFadden assaulted her during a trip they made together there this past New Year&amp;#39;s Eve. No charges have been filed against McFadden.\nKey West Police Department&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;McFadden&amp;#39;s arraignment in the stalking case is set for March 2. He has not yet entered a formal plea. Allen&amp;#39;s lawyer, Steven Devolder, said Allen denies committing any offense and is pleading not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;I remember all of it,&amp;#39; Victoria Davis wrote in a victim&amp;#39;s statement about a July 2021 beating&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a written victim&amp;#39;s statement given to a judge before McFadden&amp;#39;s sentencing in the assault case last year, Davis, now 26, wrote that McFadden was charming when they started dating, wowing her with &amp;quot;love bombs&amp;quot; and gifts. A then-22-year-old waitress at the Grumpy Goat Tavern, one of several establishments he owns, she said he took her on trips to places like Mexico and Jamaica, and she told Watchdog that he had been her best friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Davis also wrote in her statement that McFadden, whose properties also include Fat Charlie\u2019s, Boomers Bicycle Lounge, Tipsy Crow and Dough Mama Pizza, began physically abusing her after less than a year of dating. She wrote that during one fight after she&amp;#39;d accused him of cheating on her, \u201cYou punched me in the face \u2026 and when I cried about it in the morning, you said, \u2018You&amp;#39;re lucky that&amp;#39;s all that happened to you.\u2019 I wish that that was as bad as it got.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davis acknowledged in her statement the lengths to which she blamed herself for the way McFadden treated her, saying she felt damaged, used, isolated, lost and confused. His rejection, she said, often left her begging for him to treat her better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on the night they fought in July 2021, she wrote, his eyes went black. Davis alleged in the statement that after choking her to the point of unconsciousness and dragging her by the hair to the top of a staircase, he threw her down the stairs, then kicked her in the stomach so hard she passed out again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only after she\u2019d quit breathing, she wrote in her statement, did he halt the beating and try to give her CPR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI remember all of it,\u201d she wrote, addressing McFadden. \u201cI never saw you the same after that.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;McFadden and his attorney denied this assault happened as Davis described; she said she nearly died, and memories of his angry face over hers still flood her nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Steve McFadden becomes social media target&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time McFadden was charged with felony assault in 2021, he had already become controversial in Des Moines&amp;#39; close-knit service industry and other circles. Drawing wide attention in 2017 was his imposition of a dress code at his Tipsy Crow tavern banning clothing such as baggy jeans, plain T-shirts and construction boots \u2015 a rule critics said targeted young Black men. McFadden, citing the closure of a nearby bar that had been the scene of several incidents, said he was just trying to keep his patrons safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, he took what\u2019s called an Alford plea in his criminal case with Davis, admitting no guilt but acknowledging there was enough evidence to convict him at trial. The count to which he entered the plea was a misdemeanor, and he was ordered to serve a year on probation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After completing a six-week domestic abuse program later that year, he was released from probation and, under the deferred judgment, the conviction was removed from his record.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same year, two salespeople in one of his ventures, a drink truck called Morning Wood Bloody Mary, sued in a still-pending civil case, alleging his company had failed to pay commissions. Also in 2022, McFadden filed 11 defamation lawsuits against people who had criticized him online. His attorney in those cases, David Leitner, said in a July interviewthat the online criticism had negatively impacted McFadden&amp;#39;s businesses and caused him &amp;quot;substantial emotional turmoil.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Leitner maintained it&amp;#39;s defamatory for critics to call McFadden a domestic abuser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The mere fact he pleaded guilty without admitting a thing isn&amp;#39;t an admission of anything,&amp;quot; Leitner said. &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t always rely on such things. If you&amp;#39;re going to go around saying terrible things about somebody, you have some obligation to find out if it&amp;#39;s true.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits said defendants had defamed McFadden and attempted &amp;quot;to cause him harm in his business.&amp;quot; But while the lawsuits provided a time frame for the alleged behavior, they did not specify the statements the defendants allegedly made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davis said she paid a hefty price for her relationship with McFadden. Now living in Omaha, Nebraska, she said she&amp;#39;s been diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress syndrome and has suffered with frequent anxiety and sleeplessness. She said she also lost two of her oldest friends and strained her ties with her mother. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t associate with me because of the relationship,\u201d she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davis files police report in Key West&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davis said she had no idea when she flew to Florida on Dec. 30 with McFadden \u2015she violating the protective order he had against her, and he, his own \u2015 that Ankeny police were investigating new allegations he was stalking his latest ex-girlfriend with Allen&amp;#39;s help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All she knew is that she found herself again wishing, against all odds, that maybe New Year&amp;#39;s in Florida would be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davis said she does not want to make public details of some interactions with McFadden for legal reasons. But she said their fight began after a night of partying on the evening of New Year\u2019s Day at the breezy Paradise Inn Hotel in Key West. Like other arguments they&amp;#39;d had, she said, it started over another woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the complaint taken by a police officer and obtained by the Register, Davis told police that at 2:30 a.m. Jan. 2 in the hallway of their hotel suite, McFadden grabbed her by the back of the head and hit her in the face, causing a bruised right eye and a nosebleed. Their altercation, she alleged in the report. left bruising on her body and her hair extensions ripped from her head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The report said police tried without success to contact McFadden for his side of the story. No charges have been filed against him, according to Key West police.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened was eerily similar, Davis said, to their worst night, after a breakup, in July 2021 at his posh West Des Moines home \u2015 now on the market for $3.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Davis, according to the police report, said that after the New Year&amp;#39;s fight, McFadden locked her out of a bedroom in their suite while he packed to go to another hotel. She alleged he took her Louis Vuitton purse, her Dior wallet, her keys, her money and her passport, leaving only her identification for her to fly home with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said she ended up the next day on the plane with him, largely in silence. When they touched down in Des Moines, they both were arrested and jailed on contempt charges for violating the no-contact orders. Davis was released after a day, and the charge against her was dropped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;McFadden, also briefly held, was additionally charged in the stalking case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not long after Davis was released, she lost her well-paying job in Omaha, where she\u2019d moved last year, adding to her troubles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10z305a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/desmoines/comments/10z305a/woman_allegedly_beaten_by_bar_owner_mcfadden/j81ijc9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/desmoines/comments/10z305a/woman_allegedly_beaten_by_bar_owner_mcfadden/", "name": "t1_j81ijc9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/desmoines", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1676069674.0, "created_utc": 1676069674.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/investigations/readers-watchdog/2023/02/10/steve-mcfaddens-ex-girlfriend-describes-alleged-violence-against-her-des-moines-restaurant-bar-owner/69868012007/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rbt6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Woman allegedly beaten by bar owner McFadden describes going back to him, says it was a mistake", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 29, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "desmoines", "link_author": "Puzzles3", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j81i37j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "elsee28", "num_comments": 31, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10z305a", "score": 29, "author_fullname": "t2_4oh46", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Woman allegedly beaten by bar owner describes going back to him, says it was a mistake\nNew allegations against Des Moines restaurant and bar owner Steve McFadden raise questions about whether Iowa's court system is doing enough to protect victims of abuse.\n\nKey Points:\n\n-\tAn ex-girlfriend previously assaulted by bar owner Steve McFadden speaks publicly for the first time about her allegations of another assault.\n-\tIt's fairly common for abused women to let offenders back in their lives, a domestic violence advocate says.\n-\tThe new assault allegations against McFadden and charges of stalking in a separate case have raised questions about whether Iowa courts are doing enough to protect abuse victims.\n-\tA victim's advocate is calling for lethality assessments of domestic violence offenders and notification if the individual is in the same proximity.\n\n\nVictoria Davis can\u2019t easily describe what convinced her to fly to Florida for New Year's Eve with Steve McFadden.\n\nThe beating she\u2019d taken from her former boyfriend over a year and a half before and the end of their toxic relationship, she said, had left her devastated and feeling helpless, \u201clike my life was completely falling apart.\u201d\n\nMcFadden, 53, a prominent Des Moines restaurant and bar owner, had been vilified on social media over that widely publicized assault.
