The idea that HHV-6 mRNA is only present when the virus is active is also false. \n\nThe actual article does also make some very misleading statements by the investigators, which is highly common in the field. The inherited virus does not show to have any actual affect, and can be a moot point. The authors fail to mention that the drugs used in the study affect all herpesviruses, not just HHV-6, but I understand they were trying to paint the picture in such a way that sounded better for those who are funding their research, HHV-6 foundation. It should be noted that most people have multiple different types of herpesviruses present in their body. Also, the drugs used in the study did exactly what they were supposed to, which is prevent the expression of late replication mRNA, which is what they were using as a marker. There is no data about protein expression, so there is no way to say that the mRNA they are detecting actually has anything to do with the disease in any way. They only looked at 4 patients out of a possible 15,000-20,000 in the USA alone, according to them. \n\nSource: I have in the past and currently work in a herpesvirus lab, which include studies on not just a single type of herpesvirus.

The idea that HHV-6 mRNA is only present when the virus is active is also false. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual article does also make some very misleading statements by the investigators, which is highly common in the field. The inherited virus does not show to have any actual affect, and can be a moot point. The authors fail to mention that the drugs used in the study affect all herpesviruses, not just HHV-6, but I understand they were trying to paint the picture in such a way that sounded better for those who are funding their research, HHV-6 foundation. It should be noted that most people have multiple different types of herpesviruses present in their body. Also, the drugs used in the study did exactly what they were supposed to, which is prevent the expression of late replication mRNA, which is what they were using as a marker. There is no data about protein expression, so there is no way to say that the mRNA they are detecting actually has anything to do with the disease in any way.
