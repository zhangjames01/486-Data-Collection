Bell discovered his famous tests for entanglement 40 years after quantum mechanics was rigorously defined, if we had a more intuitive description of QM, the consequences of entanglement might have been more obvious from the start! Then there are all the cases where pure math finds utility in physics or number theory in cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as a researcher, I think my primary goal was always to build my intuition, and I agree with the other posters that your intuition is your most valuable tool in that role. It saves you a ton of time and energy, which in turn means you actually get stuff done instead of just giving up because it&amp;#39;s too hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_t921ok", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/MachineLearning/comments/t921ok/d_how_do_people_come_up_with_the_solution_to_a/hztevbf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/t921ok/d_how_do_people_come_up_with_the_solution_to_a/", "name": "t1_hztevbf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MachineLearning", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1646729497.0, "created_utc": 1646729497.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/t921ok/d_how_do_people_come_up_with_the_solution_to_a/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r3gv", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[D] How do people come up with the solution to a deep learning problem?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "link_author": "SciBlend", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hztco0p", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "B-80", "num_comments": 48, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hzsmyjb", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_54ad3", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I loved the first half of your comment, but I don't understand why you're so hostile to the idea that intuition is a thing.
