If Winslow improved his all-around offensive ability, particularly shot selection, consistency and range, it would transcend his presence on the floor, as already a plus-defender. \n\nWe can't understate how mature Winslow's defense was in his rookie season. He was robust individually, and fit like a glove in the Heat defensive system. We see some incredible intangibles in Winslow from his defensive performance. It reflects his ability to understand a complex professional team defense, and identify how he can excel within it -- a high bballIQ. This is what gives a lot of us hope for Winslow improving the offensive part of his game. \n\n**The Season**:\nWatching Winslow in the beginning of the season offensively was rough. I think due to the loss of Wade and Joe Johnson from last year's offense, there was residual expectation of filling that offensive void. Wade/Johnson were ball-dominant primary offensive-shot creators, and secondary facilitators. Winslow tried to fill this void. The problem is Winslow is a poor shot-creator, inconsistent shot maker, but above-average facilitator. He looked pretty bad at points, which caused fans to start to lose faith in his developmental potential. There were flashes of excellence, but the Heat were 2-10 at the beginning of the season, and 1-7 later, with Winslow playing major minutes. Clearly Winslow wasn't ready for the role.\n\nThen Winslow goes out ... Waiters comes in. Waiter's skill-set matches up perfectly with what Winslow was trying to fill. This is when we went on a tear. Being an armchair basic analyst, Waiter's was far more effective at working the system. Spacing got a lot better - 3 pa and efficiency went way up. The mix of cutting, spacing, and facilitating just worked better with Johnson, Waiters, and Dragic. \n\n**What's next**:\nNow we don't need Winslow to take the Waiters role. I'm confident that Winslow will learn the Heat system that worked better without him, and find his role within it. I always felt Winslow had better feel for offense than the results showed. Winslow needs to take a more subordinate role to the dynamic playmaking between Johnson/Waiters/Dragic, and he definitely has the athleticism and bballIQ to make smart cuts, and create space. \n\nWe were trying to imagine a future All-Star out of Winslow. By his performance in the drivers seat, I'd say he was far from it. But we know Winslow very is special &amp; unique. He obviously had the trust of the coaching staff giving him the opportunity, and it's from the tremendous intangibles he emits that we can be more optimistic about potential growth. With the Heat coaching staff and system, proven by our magical season, I will be giving my faith and anticipation for Justice Winslow!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retrospective&lt;/strong&gt;: Before this season, we were banking on Winslow&amp;#39;s (and TJ and Richardson&amp;#39;s) individual development.
