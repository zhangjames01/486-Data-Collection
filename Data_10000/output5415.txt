When I was at the peak of my obsession with survivor I only wanted more of what I had liked previously. I took a decent break from watching (seasons 35-39) and noticed that when I returned for WaW that I was no longer incensed by things that annoy other big fans and might have annoyed me in the past too, like fire tokens or Edge of Extinction.\n\nThese days I think my ideal for survivor is for every season to be completely different in terms of format. Sometimes a hit, sometimes a miss. I watch a lot of things, TV shows and movies and such. I don't need perfection from survivor, and I don't want them to focus on making something without flaws. I want it to be surprising and memorable and for each season to justify itself by standing out.\n\nThat's not to say I am open arms for all twists. Having just watched the latest season of Australian survivor, there are a bunch of twists I thought outright made the show worse, most prominently the ones revolving around surviving being voted out. (Also I hate the Ausvivor drawn out format, but thankfully US survivor is if anything moving away from that)\n\nSo we'll see. The show is about the game and strategy of survivor now. If they are going to invest in that side of things, will they enrich it or flood it with noise?

When I was at the peak of my obsession with survivor I only wanted more of what I had liked previously. I took a decent break from watching (seasons 35-39) and noticed that when I returned for WaW that I was no longer incensed by things that annoy other big fans and might have annoyed me in the past too, like fire tokens or Edge of Extinction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days I think my ideal for survivor is for every season to be completely different in terms of format. Sometimes a hit, sometimes a miss. I watch a lot of things, TV shows and movies and such. I don&amp;#39;t need perfection from survivor, and I don&amp;#39;t want them to focus on making something without flaws. I want it to be surprising and memorable and for each season to justify itself by standing out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say I am open arms for all twists. Having just watched the latest season of Australian survivor, there are a bunch of twists I thought outright made the show worse, most prominently the ones revolving around surviving being voted out.
