Now an adult, that's a different story.  They can decide for themselves whether they want to cut their life short.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward, really.  Medically necessary = necessary to prevent further harm to the subject's health, i.e., there is a reason to believe that there is imminent risk of harm, injury, or death to that individual by not performing the procedure.  Medically necessary is not a case of \"we need to prevent the slim chance of something happening 10, 15, or 20 years down the road.\"  It's about imminent risk.\n\nComparing botched circumcisions with botched removal of wisdom teeth is ridiculous.  Wisdom teeth are typically removed only if their growth is causing a problem or the if dentist can see that their continued growth will cause a problem.  Yes, it can be preventative but in those cases it is based on direct evidence of future necessity for that specific individual.\n\nSo there's my first argument, that in nearly every case, infant circumcision is not medically necessary.\n\nMy second argument is that in the absence of a medical necessity, it is wrong to surgically modify someone else's body without their consent.  Furthermore, an infant cannot give consent, and most children and teens cannot reasonably give any kind of informed consent.  So in the case of infant circumcision we have parents imposing their will in such a way as to force an unconsenting and defenseless, living human being to undergo an irreversible body modification surgery for no medical reason whatsoever. Why?\n\nAnd finally we have the issue of pain and suffering.  It is my strong belief that we, as human beings, should avoid causing unnecessary pain and suffering and be working to reduce the overall amount of pain and suffering in the world.  There can be no reasonable doubt that surgically removing the most sensitive part of the male genitalia is a painful procedure that causes suffering.  I had a friend who was circumcised in his 20's and he assured me that it was actually quite painful for some time (in addition to the loss of sensation).  You can try to say \"we don't know for sure because we can't talk with a baby to confirm it,\" but that's simply sticking your head in the sand.  Babies have essentially the same nervous systems as the children and adults do.  If you cut them they feel pain.  If you cut them someplace where they have the highest concentration of nerve endings in the body, they will feel a lot of pain.  A baby doesn't laugh and giggle at it's bris, it cries.  Because getting part of your dick chopped off fucking hurts.  Whether or not the child remembers it 20 years later is irrelevant, and it certainly does not justify the pain.  My little brother kicked me in the nuts when I was little.  I remember the incident, but when I think about it I don't feel pain.  I don't relive the incident in any meaningful way.  Does that somehow mitigate what he did?\n\nMore to the point, why is it incumbent upon the anti-circumcision crowd to justify their positions?  Do you realize how ridiculous it sounds to say that \"unless you can justify why you shouldn't be forced to have a medically unnecessary surgical procedure applied without your consent you're going to have to be circumcised?\"\n\nHere's an idea, how about you explain to me why anyone should be subjected to a medically unnecessary surgical procedure without their consent.  And \"he won't remember the pain\" isn't a valid argument.\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, I wouldn&amp;#39;t allow a child to keep a cancerous leg just so he can play if it would reduce his lifespan.  Now an adult, that&amp;#39;s a different story.  They can decide for themselves whether they want to cut their life short.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty straightforward, really.  Medically necessary = necessary to prevent further harm to the subject&amp;#39;s health, i.e., there is a reason to believe that there is imminent risk of harm, injury, or death to that individual by not performing the procedure.  Medically necessary is not a case of &amp;quot;we need to prevent the slim chance of something happening 10, 15, or 20 years down the road.&amp;quot;  It&amp;#39;s about imminent risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Comparing botched circumcisions with botched removal of wisdom teeth is ridiculous.  Wisdom teeth are typically removed only if their growth is causing a problem or the if dentist can see that their continued growth will cause a problem.  Yes, it can be preventative but in those cases it is based on direct evidence of future necessity for that specific individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s my first argument, that in nearly every case, infant circumcision is not medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My second argument is that in the absence of a medical necessity, it is wrong to surgically modify someone else&amp;#39;s body without their consent.  Furthermore, an infant cannot give consent, and most children and teens cannot reasonably give any kind of informed consent.  So in the case of infant circumcision we have parents imposing their will in such a way as to force an unconsenting and defenseless, living human being to undergo an irreversible body modification surgery for no medical reason whatsoever. Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And finally we have the issue of pain and suffering.  It is my strong belief that we, as human beings, should avoid causing unnecessary pain and suffering and be working to reduce the overall amount of pain and suffering in the world.  There can be no reasonable doubt that surgically removing the most sensitive part of the male genitalia is a painful procedure that causes suffering.  I had a friend who was circumcised in his 20&amp;#39;s and he assured me that it was actually quite painful for some time (in addition to the loss of sensation).  You can try to say &amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t know for sure because we can&amp;#39;t talk with a baby to confirm it,&amp;quot; but that&amp;#39;s simply sticking your head in the sand.  Babies have essentially the same nervous systems as the children and adults do.  If you cut them they feel pain.  If you cut them someplace where they have the highest concentration of nerve endings in the body, they will feel a lot of pain.  A baby doesn&amp;#39;t laugh and giggle at it&amp;#39;s bris, it cries.  Because getting part of your dick chopped off fucking hurts.  Whether or not the child remembers it 20 years later is irrelevant, and it certainly does not justify the pain.  My little brother kicked me in the nuts when I was little.  I remember the incident, but when I think about it I don&amp;#39;t feel pain.  I don&amp;#39;t relive the incident in any meaningful way.  Does that somehow mitigate what he did?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More to the point, why is it incumbent upon the anti-circumcision crowd to justify their positions?  Do you realize how ridiculous it sounds to say that &amp;quot;unless you can justify why you shouldn&amp;#39;t be forced to have a medically unnecessary surgical procedure applied without your consent you&amp;#39;re going to have to be circumcised?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an idea, how about you explain to me why anyone should be subjected to a medically unnecessary surgical procedure without their consent.
