Lady recalls her time spent doing some extremely advanced necromancy at a young age and gets together with Croaker-God to sort of re-experience what went on there in hopes that they'll learn something to help with their daughter.\n\nThere's another short story, The Dark Lord As A Teen that was written after PoS that also deals with necromancy that Croaker-God would have been somewhat privy to and may have been written as a \"Croaker-God would review this event so you get to see it too.\" \n\nIn terms of the \"present\" in PoS, Croaker-God and Lady more or less beam their consciousness into that era. When the first Tides Elba comes back and has black hair and all as Mischievous Rain, The Lady probably believes she sent Tides Elba back as a taken, but she is being possessed by Lady (Lady = Soldiers Live, The Lady = PoS era Ruling Queen). Croaker-God is likely Ankou as Ankou has a third red eye like Shivetya (thus now Croaker). The kids are a mystery but likely something to do with the shadows that are all over the last few books. They could just be some things Croaker and Lady made out of magic that more or less could be considered their children. \n\nThere's a time where Mischievous Rain comes back and the kids say that it's not their mom, probably because she is not currently being possessed, as the future-Lady is their mom, so Mischievous Rain, the Taken that The Lady made, is not their mom when future-Lady is not possessing her. \n\nIt's likely they can only do the full possession thing when PoS-Croaker is around because they're going through his experiences/memories that Croaker-God can access as Shivetya. This would explain why Mischievous Rain had to wait a full day for him to sober up before doing anything that one time. Lady may be able to possess Rain when Rain is near The Lady. I am not sure how much of any of this The Lady is privy to, but I would guess either none at all or all of it, but all the time travel shenanigans I would assume Lady helps Croaker-God figure out how to deceive her old self when they wish. \n\nThere's also a point where Two-Dead completely flips personality and makes some wise-cracks that PoS-Croaker likes. He is probably being possessed by Croaker-God at this point, and of course Croaker likes his own jokes. \n\nThen there's the end where Lady finds Laissa and her son, who is a \"living\" and extremely competent necromancer. PoS-Croaker is present as a conduit for sending their consciousnesses but mind-wiped so he doesn't remember any of it. Lady probably spends this time talking to the son and figuring out what to do with their real daughter frozen in the caves. They go through the effort of letting us know that Laissa could have been totally saved if they knew what they do now, so their daughter can probably be saved with that knowledge once they get it out of the necromancer-son guy. \n\nAlso it is assumed that the two Tides-hunter girls that stick with Croaker and Rain are Shukrat and Arkana. They act pretty similarly and are given extremely preferential treatment, no reason to think otherwise really. \n\nThe other element of this is Lady is using Croaker-God to get some quality, physical time with her husband that she can't now that he's Shivetya. I'm sure she's happy to get to spend time with Croaker as he first caught her interest back when she was The Lady and unable to express any outward affection that didn't also involve mind-rending torture. Kind of sweet in a weird meta-physical-mind-wiping kind of way. They never had much a shot at a normal anything, so the days they spend playing house were probably really nice for her and for Croaker-God to sort of experience/see retroactively. \n\nAs an added bonus, in either Cranky Bitch or the Leta short story, they end up killing a Taken who is almost certainly non-possessed Mischievous Rain. Croaker at some point muses that he cannot for the life of him conjure a clear image of what The Lady looks like, then sees a dead Taken that he thinks is the most beautiful thing imaginable that he feels like he needs to spend his life with to an extreme degree. This taken probably looks like The Lady or at least Mischievous Rain and he realizes that on a subconscious level.\n\nI'm not really sure what happens to all the other Tides Elbas but I don't think we're supposed to worry about that too much. Honestly The Lady, probably killed the ones she didn't Take, and I don't think she Took any besides Rain. \n\nOn the other points, there are plenty of discrepancies that don't really get papered over by \"unreliable narrator.\" Lady's mother is a big one. I am not sure how Soulcatcher being one of the sisters fits in here. I figured they'd mention if she was Taken at this point, but maybe she is Taken and they just don't bother to mention it. Howler seems to be treated pretty normally despite being Taken, so one of the sisters could be and they just didn't mention it outright. \n\nThe Lady's Taken though did survive the Barrowland fight, albeit with all of their powers stripped. So the war amongst the Taken could be a non-sorcery war, as they would be the figures with the most troops under their command with The Lady out of the picture and would probably not be satisfied retreating to a quiet life. It could also be referring to discussing the conflict with Limper.
