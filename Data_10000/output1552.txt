A woman's ex-husband becomes her new boss after her company is sold, and he's determined to make her pay for breaking his heart ten years ago.\n\nI'm normally not very interested in second-chance romance or extended flashbacks, but both things worked really well in this story.

Their present day conflict is told in parallel with their sweet high school love story. I enjoyed the gradual reveal of the reasons Dakota left him, and the balance of messy angst mixed with a tortuous slow burn was perfect. This is actually part one of two, but stopping here because the reviews aren't stellar for book two, and it has a decent enough HFN ending if you don't mind the abrupt stop.\n\n**{River of Shadows by Karina Halle}** \\- 3.5/5.

Hanna's adventures in the first half of the book were interesting, though I wish the lore and characters introduced had more impact on the plot. Death struck a good balance between being a d\\*ck but also showing some tenderness to Hanna. Her 180 from distrust to lust happened too quickly and I wish the tension between them had been drawn out longer. Audiobook narrator Jo Raylon gave a lot of life to Hanna's character, though at times her performance was a little over the top and distracting.

There was oodles of great tension and denial of feelings between Luca and Valentina. Things escalate until one day Valentina finds herself in a bind (unrelated to work), and Luca takes advantage of the situation to make her his wife. The style and pace of this book felt a lot like *The Favor* by Suzanne Wright, but there is one key difference: single versus dual POV. At first I really liked the dual POV because it was fun to watch Luca going nuts over his secretary and not realizing he was hopelessly in love with her. But after he wises up, a lot of the tension in the story is gone\u2014tension that *The Favor* did a better job maintaining because we only had Vienna's viewpoint, and had to read between the lines to know how Dane truly felt about her. By having both leads POV in The Temporary Wife, their various insecurities start to feel tedious because we know exactly how they really feel about each other at all times. I will say that Luca's obsession with his wife and how he flirts with her is super cute, and I liked his groveling and continued commitment to atoning for his mistakes in the first part of the book.\n\nSome other random nitpicks: A few too many smut scenes.
