Unfortunately, for trans patients on antiandrogens for a long time the flare up may actually stimulate more T production that wasn&amp;#39;t there previously, and if previous AA are discontinued it&amp;#39;s not unusual for T levels to rise in general. If you were to continue a small dose of AA alongside the deca you would be generally safe since cypro and deca are generally considered safe as long as the cypro is taken at small doses. See if you can call your doctor for a refill on the cypro.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really despise decap and believe it&amp;#39;s mechanism of action is generally much more intolerable than other simple anti androgens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3rnqmy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/asktransgender/comments/3rnqmy/higher_testosterone_on_decapeptyl_than_cypro/cwpowy7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3rnqmy/higher_testosterone_on_decapeptyl_than_cypro/", "name": "t1_cwpowy7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/asktransgender", "author_flair_text": "biochemistry", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1446749788.0, "created_utc": 1446749788.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3rnqmy/higher_testosterone_on_decapeptyl_than_cypro/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "So what length are your fingers?
