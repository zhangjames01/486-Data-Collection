I understand the people saying \"But if you don't exist, you won't care about not existing!\" I mean, technically that's true, but it has never helped calm me. Here are a few of the things that have helped me cope:\n\n1. The \"Slaughterhouse Five\" defense. \"The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.\nWhen a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is \"so it goes.\"\n\nI have heard this theory in other places and I find it makes a nice sort of sense. All the moments of your life may still exist, in which case, freed from biological constraints, perhaps in death we get to go back to the moments we like best. I also find that this makes a sort of sense for religious theories. If you are a good person, who is motivated by love and is at peace with others, perhaps you have more good moments to return to. Or maybe you are just more open to seeing the good in all the moments you have. People driven by hate and anger may be obsessed with returning to the moments that were upsetting. Maybe all moments seem bad.\n\n2. The idea of transcendence. C.S. Lewis said something like, \"You don't have a soul. You ARE a soul. You have a body.\" So this body is the vehicle through which I experience the world but it isn't the driver. There is a cool article about a DMT experience you can find here https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/  which also talks about how we have difficulty wrapping our heads around this concept. We could find peace if we just realized we were capable of \"getting out of the car.\" We fear death because we cannot fathom the idea that we are more than a body.\n\n3. Anecdotal experiences. When my grandfather was dying he was pretty out of if. So we didn't tell him that his older brother, Tom, had passed away. A few days before he died, he looked up, completely lucid and said, \"Tom! What the heck are you doing here?\" Some people might say this is a trick the brain plays to ease your passing but I don't think so. I know my grandfather. He had a complicated relationship with his older but he adored his younger brother, Mark, who had passed away 2 decades earlier. If his brain had simply wanted to comfort him, he would have seen Mark. He didn't. I now believe that those who go before us come back to guide us along.

I have gone on some trips without my husband but they were more by necessity, and less like vacations (conferences, help my sister move). All  true vacations, we go together. I don&amp;#39;t think either of us would change that. We have pretty similar interests, and even when they don&amp;#39;t line up perfectly we like to share the experiences and see new facets of eachother. I don&amp;#39;t know, I guess I&amp;#39;m very sentimental. I love him with all my heart, he is my best friend, and I want to build up a lifetime of shared memories and feeling like I am missing the chance to do that would hurt in a way I can&amp;#39;t quite express. Going somewhere without him always pales in comparison to being somewhere with him. This is the relationship dynamic that works for us, but I think it would only work if both partners felt the same way so ymmv&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_bxupgo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/bxupgo/women_in_committed_relationships_how_do_you_feel/eq9yt2v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/bxupgo/women_in_committed_relationships_how_do_you_feel/", "name": "t1_eq9yt2v", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskWomen", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1559921138.0, "created_utc": 1559921138.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/bxupgo/women_in_committed_relationships_how_do_you_feel/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What are some serial killer facts/ facts about serial killers that you find extremely interesting?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "zimmy9921", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eq50qjy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Lalaithial", "num_comments": 8725, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eq3o2mh", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_7cmpk", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Right, but statistics aren't usually meant to account for every possible factor.
