Browsing Reddit can easily give you the impression that Muslims think about nothing other than Islam and sharia in minute detail, that atheists are obsessed with religion, and that exmuslims are gagging on bucketloads of white supremacist semen. But it is worth keeping in mind that subreddits are intended to be somewhat focused discussions and that these communities tend to appeal to a certain subgroup within their demographic. That said, most Muslims, even if moderately conservative, generally have a lot on their plate and think about far more than just Islam and sharia. Most are probably fairly practical in their application of Islam to their daily lives. Redditors are usually fairly young, so the demographic of Reddit Muslim tends to be unmarried, late teens to early 30s, and middle class. The \"holier than thou\" image that Reddit Muslims like to present online is about ego and showmanship. For example, I know one of the Salafis from /r/islam in person and like most online salafis, the guy is a total hypocrite IRL. While he spends all his time online condemning people for every minor transgression and pretending that he's God's gift to Islam, IRL he's shagging his Hari Krishna girlfriend in private and getting blowjobs from her at the back of his makeshift market stall where he sells fruit and gives dawah to western tourists. \n\nSimilarly, most atheists and most exmuslims have actual lives and they're too busy living them to be obsessing about religion or how much they might hate Islam and Muslims. What we see is just a very small demographic of the much broader atheist and exmuslim population, those who for one reason or another aren't able to successfully integrate into broader society. \n\nAnother aspect of this is that because subreddits are focused discussions, the culture of a subreddit tends to keep its users focused on the meta or on the primary discussion issue. For example, if you wanted to post about Kerbal Space Program 2 in /r/islam, /r/atheism, or /r/exmuslim, and the post had absolutely nothing to do with the focal point of those communities, that post might get removed, downvoted, or might simply not get much traction. Because we keep the discussions somewhat focused by moderating out unrelated content, that also results in a sense of \"community policing\" in which rank and file members of the subreddit (i.e., not the mods) begin to modulate the culture or the sentiment of the discussions. For example, /r/islam mods might allow progressive content, but the community is decidedly conservative, so they shout down and downvote anything that isn't conservative. /r/atheism mods might allow contents that doesn't demonize religion, but the community is decidedly anti-theist (not just atheist), so they shout down and downvote anything that doesn't reflect their anti-theist views. /r/exmuslim mods might allow content that doesn't demonize Islam or Muslims, but their community is decidedly anti-Islam, anti-Muslim, and perhaps psychologically traumatized. As a result, they shout down and downvote anything that doesn't demonize Islam or Muslims, and they actively look to keep one another in a state of psychological trauma. From a psychiatric perspective, I often worry about the ex-religious subreddits and how they glorify being traumatized.

If anything, the number of religious and non-religious people has increased significantly over the last century as a nature result of population growth. Europe, East Asia, America, and Australia have seen a significant increase in the proportion of their populations identifying as non-religious, although this swing has slowed markedly over the past 15-20 years, with some sources reporting slowed growth, and others reporting a slow negative growth. Oceana, West Asia, and the Middle East, on the other hand, have reported not only rapid population growth, but also a significant increase in their religious demographics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11rtc1r", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DebateReligion/comments/11rtc1r/the_world_would_be_a_better_place_without_the/jcmxx32/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/11rtc1r/the_world_would_be_a_better_place_without_the/", "name": "t1_jcmxx32", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DebateReligion", "author_flair_text": "mod | Will sell body for Vegemite", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679098467.0, "created_utc": 1679098467.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/11rtc1r/the_world_would_be_a_better_place_without_the/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t8su", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "'haram to be friends with the opposite gender' where's the sources?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 9, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "progressive_islam", "link_author": "zeelumango", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcmwxpj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Taqwacore", "num_comments": 67, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jclz4t1", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_5tbme", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Most scholars agree that this means to look lustfully upon a woman, not simply looking at someone who is female.
