I think for those who are comofrtbale with CS already, then it may have been the other way around, but this wasn't the case for me. That being said, I think you will be fine.\n\nHere's my anwers to your questions:\n\n\n1)If you can take someone else besides Van Gelder than I would suggest doing that. Usually this is a process of going to the other section and asking the teacher if there's any more room, be sure to mention you're in the other section. If not, just be sure to set aside some time to go have the TA help you when you get stuck. \n\n2)If you're feeling far behind then there's always resources online to help you. There's plenty of code challenges or simple programs to help you understand a certain language. Again, I'm gonna reccomend going to talk to the TA as they will most likely be able to show you some things will help you a lot. Something I had to learn while at UCSC was how to ask for help and not feel dumb about doing so. Not saying that's where you're at, but certainly don't feel bad about asking a \"dumb\" question.\n\n 3)There's a thing called MSI for CMPS 101 that is essentially a group study session. Usually, it's taught by someone who has taken the class and done well. I highly recommend it because not only do they have some choice advice about the tests, they also should be able to answer any questions that may not be appropriate for class or anything you still don't know.\n\nSomething I do want to hammer home is to talk to your TA (dead horse I know). But so many CS students are either too headstrong to ask for help or too embarrassed to ask for it. You really shouldn't be stuck on a problem for more than a half an hour before you ask for help. If you run into those road blocks very often then it's going to be very helpful to have a TA near you to clear something up and allow you to move on. CS is tough, but if you come at it with the right attitude you can definitely do well.\n\nGood luck this year, it's gonna be fun. PM if you have any more questions.

Not saying that&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;re at, but certainly don&amp;#39;t feel bad about asking a &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)There&amp;#39;s a thing called MSI for CMPS 101 that is essentially a group study session. Usually, it&amp;#39;s taught by someone who has taken the class and done well. I highly recommend it because not only do they have some choice advice about the tests, they also should be able to answer any questions that may not be appropriate for class or anything you still don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something I do want to hammer home is to talk to your TA (dead horse I know). But so many CS students are either too headstrong to ask for help or too embarrassed to ask for it. You really shouldn&amp;#39;t be stuck on a problem for more than a half an hour before you ask for help. If you run into those road blocks very often then it&amp;#39;s going to be very helpful to have a TA near you to clear something up and allow you to move on. CS is tough, but if you come at it with the right attitude you can definitely do well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck this year, it&amp;#39;s gonna be fun. PM if you have any more questions.
