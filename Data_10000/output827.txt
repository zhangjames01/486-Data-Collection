Is the Creator of His Creation still good, if he creates evil men just to be punished?\n\nWhile our perception of our existence is determined through circumstance and free will, it\u2019s actually fundamental that Allah controls everything. Consider the fact that Allah guides whom He wills and lets astray whom He wills. \n\nWhy would the Most-Compassionate and the Most-Merciful create evil men just to be tortured? Consider the example of the Pharaoh. We know Allah uses evil men to educate us on the paths that are astray. From this example, we know not to lose sight of Allah, and we know that to seek Him is to often look beyond our own perceptions. Even, when our perceptions are not even remotely similar to the Pharaoh\u2019s, his failures highlight where our smallest issues could be similar. I myself am struggling with music being haram. How could playing an instrument, or listening to music, be so evil? If I were to justify it to myself, wouldn\u2019t I be sharing the same traits of the Pharaoh?

Yes, Allah creates people who become worthy of punishment. It does not take away from His innate perfection, true justice, and ultimate good. If the question is proposed to slight this, what is the desired response? To critique the Creator\u2019s judgement? How does challenging Allah\u2019s decisions assist oneself? If one walks away feeling like they\u2019ve successfully challenged an Omnipotent Being, then how does that new sense of pride actually benefit that person. Does it improve their morality? Does breaking down a religion over a self-perceived paradox make the ideology\u2019s lessons appear less vital? It\u2019s always interesting that sweeping hypotheticals seem to always ignore that the details of life are vast. Often things are simple, but provide more than what they seem. Putting the Creator into a nutshell just becomes self-serving at some point, when obviously His creation (which we do see everyday) is complex in itself. \n\nThe question shouldn\u2019t trouble you, or lead you to debate.
