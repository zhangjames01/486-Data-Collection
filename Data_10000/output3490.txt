Also, the rankings go back two years and that is mainly because of teams who aren&amp;#39;t located close collegiate tournaments and cant play in a lot of collegiate events so that is why they take a while to adjust but my opinion is that you should only focus on the most current rankings. Things will eventually work out so the better teams, that have been playing well, will be ranked higher than teams that WERE good but no longer compete at the same level. As the older tournaments are no longer used to calculate the rankings things will adjust properly.\nAnd, the NCDGC tournament results have the biggest influence on the rankings so by them beating y&amp;#39;all there it is going to take a few wins for ya&amp;#39;ll to be ranked higher than them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In regards to your post:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand how things can be perceived in text and thank you for apologizing.
