I'm normally pretty shameless on Reddit, but I prefer anonymity when discussing this aspect of my past. \n\nWhen I was between 12 and 16, I was what you would classify as \"otherkin.\" I wholeheartedly and unequivocally believed that I was part werewolf. I can assure you that it is indeed *very* possible to believe that you are some sort of mythical creature. I can't tell you why everyone does, but I can tell you some of the factors that led to my adoption of the idea.\n\nWhen I was younger, I wouldn't exactly call myself very popular-- at least, not how the term is popularly connoted. Most everyone else knew me in the same way that you would \"know\" that one chair that squeaks a bit when you lean back. I was nothing more or less than a quirk in the background noise of reality. I was only approached when people wanted something. That pattern continued until I met my first true friend. We'll call him S.\n\nTo say that S was imaginative is an understatement. He was able to immediately concoct elaborate storylines with a variety of challenges for us to overcome. It was normal enough at first. After all, children regularly role-play as part of their socialization. It's not uncommon for them to play as implausible heroes in impossible situations. It's also not uncommon for particular characters to reoccur often. But after a while, our adventures started taking a turn towards what was retrospectively bizarre but what was, at the time, fantastic: We started to believe that we somehow embodied these characters in a more literal sense. The more we played, the more these personalities solidified in our minds and they eventually emerged as aspects of our actual selves. \n\nI've read through most of the comments in this CMV, so I'm going to address the elephant in the room: \"How could anyone believe that they were actually the people they played?\" Honestly, I couldn't give you a complete answer. What I will do is give you my best theory.\n\nAround this time, S and I started to seriously hit puberty. Our bodies were literally changing at incredible rates. We found ourselves measurably stronger and more adept at certain tasks in a few months time-- a rate that we naively thought was superhuman. We were seemingly converging on the characters that we assumed during play. I can't be entirely sure, but I would bet that our thought process was this:\n\n1) We pretend to be these characters. This means that they exist somewhere in our minds.\n2) We were seemingly growing to a strength that these characters possessed. \nConclusion: The reason we were thinking about them and the reason we were growing to be like them is because we *really* were them. The purpose of our games were congruent to the purpose of young tigers play-fighting: To prepare ourselves for what we would actually become.\n\nI have to stress that this is retrospective because if I didn't it might appear that this conclusion dawned on us like an epiphany. It didn't. It was slowly adopted by our minds. Which is much more dangerous. Time gives the opportunity for falsehoods to solidify through the mounting of improbable \"evidence.\"\n\nThe strength and confidence of being a werewolf is utterly addicting. Remember those moments of awkwardness and uncertainty that came with being a preteen/young teenager? Well that must have been a problem for you, mere mortal, because I had the blood of a fucking monster and monsters don't have to worry about your banal trivialities. I understand how implausible and absurd this line of thought seems, but could you imagine how unbelievably **liberating** it can be? It gave me a way to cope with a reality that I was just struggling to understand. A reality that I was feeling more and more isolated from as every day passed. It was a vicious cycle: The more people rejected me for my other idiosyncrasies (I was a very nerdy kid and my choice of sports was never exactly popular) the more I withdrew into my being a werewolf. The more I withdrew into being a werewolf, the more confident I was in my current idiosyncrasies and the more others started to sneak in. Soon, a small group of people recognized pattern and knew the mechanism, knew that I was a beast. They knew from experience.\n\nThis is where I met some of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life. It turns out that others were just like me. They had \"others\" either inside them or embodied by their minds and souls. They were open with me, included me, and we all felt a sense of kinship. We were a family of outcasts and misfits. You'd be amazed at how many people latched on to this idea or actively enabled it. I met three of my girlfriends through connections in the group and two of them were active participants. And I can assure you that every single person in that was in this group was just as sincere in their beliefs as I was in mine. \n\nAt one point in the comments, I saw the OP and a few others express doubt at the sincerity of some believers due to the fact that they don't embody all the behaviors that their \"trapped\" personalities would ostensibly entail. (I think the example used is that kids aren't flinging themselves into the streets like hedgehogs so they have to at least be aware that they aren't entirely hedgehogs). From my experience, the exact opposite is true. I was *so* sure that I was a werewolf, so committed to the belief, that I did my damnedest to ensure that no one outside the group would find out. I recognized that we were in a human world and if we wanted to survive without being ostracized, we had to act as normally as possible. That meant subduing the more visible aspects of yourself so that you could have as normal a life as possible. Imagine being a transgender individual in a time before it was more socially acceptable. You felt like an outsider unfairly born into a world that would reject your actual self. Many simply repressed themselves to get along as well as they could, but some people were more vocal about it. As such, they were rejected, shunned, and faced threats of violence. Those \"attention seeking kids\" on Tumblr aren't much different. They're bullheaded-- the world ought to accept them for who they are! And then they're subsequently shunned, rejected, and (at least in high school) recipients of very real threats of violence. Some of the more \"visible\" members got picked on relentlessly. They'd get targeted for coordinated harassment campaigns by certain cliques that only thought of them as \"that fuckin' weird kid in my gym class.\" I know people who got the shit beaten out of them because someone would get carried away. In the face of this very real adversity, do you think that most of us would be stupid enough to chase traffic? I would say that we just wanted to be normal, but that's not entirely accurate. The reason that I was first attracted to the seemingly innocent practice to begin with was because I *was* normal. I was just a quirk in the background noise, remember? I think I subliminally recognized that everyone else was too. If normal involved loneliness and uncertainty then I wanted out. I wanted to be the kind of normal that I observed in some adults and pop-culture heroes. I wanted to be confident and unwavering. Everyone in the group was in the pursuit of this idealized normalcy. It would be many years before I realized that there is no such thing as unwavering confidence. That even heroes face hardship and doubt.  \n\n(Again, when I say \"I thought\" and \"I wanted\" it has to be clear that these weren't my contemporaneous conscious thoughts. These phrases are the product of a retrospective analysis. I can be sure of those things now. At the time, I was only sure of what I thought I was and what I actually wasn't: A werewolf trapped in a human world). \n\nI eventually left the idea, but it wasn't exactly easy. I spent a good portion of my developmentally crucial years convincing myself of a fantastical falsehood. It took a lot of time to rewrite myself. To find other means to embody the confidence and assurance that I now realize was the driving force behind my behavior. But not everybody leaves. And of those that do, not everyone manages to return in one piece. \n\nI'm sure you can sit here and diagnose some sort of psychological condition. In fact, I'd be stupid to think that you already haven't. But I can offer nothing more than the most sincere assurance that I was sane. I understood the reality that most people experience and I \"understood\" levels that I thought simply existed beyond it. And please do not use my usage of the term \"beyond it\" as an excuse to debase religiosity.  The wiring is similar but not identical. I knew people who were hardcore Christians that justified there existence through convoluted interpretations of scripture. I knew others that were atheists and just thought that we were special via other rationalizations. (In fact, I can remember a couple of instances where Christian proponents debated Atheist ones. It's interesting to watch a Vampire debate a Monster on the virtues of faith). I can't speak for everyone, but I know that my evolution was probably a product of some twisted form of rationalization (see the part about 1. 2. and Conclusion above). I don't think I was deranged. Stupid? Absolutely. Embarrassingly accepting of the supernatural? You bet. But if you allow for people to believe in the existence of something, anything, that could exist beyond our mortal ken and they are in desperate need of some sort of strength to understand an uncertain world, I would say that it isn't insane, irrational, or some sophomoric attempt to get attention. Sadly, it can make all the sense in the world.\n\n **TL;DR: Coming from someone who would've previously identified as \"otherkin,\" be careful about labeling these beliefs as insincere or insane. Everyone is fighting a battle that you know nothing about. They may not even know much about it themselves.**  ", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to be completely open before I start, I&amp;#39;m using a throwaway account.
