The attendees were sat in folding chairs on the grass. She walked down the aisle alone towards her waiting husband.

They felt that my being there with my nametag on maybe made it ok for the wedding to happen in front of an altar to idols as their parents wanted.

Yet **the marriage itself is still put in place.** How we choose to deliver the package may change, but the delivery still happens, and the package is received.\n\nSimilarly, the covenant of the endowment (and any other covenant) may be delivered differently depending on the understanding and needs of the recipients. Here are some examples:\n\n* Abraham made his first big covenant by performing the ancient ritual of \"I'll cut the cookie, you pick which half you want\" except with livestock. This was a common \"deal making\" behavior for his day.\n* His grandson, Jacob, demanded blessings for himself, and had to climb a ladder of covenants before getting his own version of the endowment.\n* Alma the elder took a ritual washing in \"living waters\" typical for his culture and time period and formalized it into something called \"baptism.\"\n* Joseph Smith found meaning in the rites of the freemasons and borrowed them to teach eternal truths.\n\nThe changes to the ritual dramas we engage in are never ending, but the covenant is still eternal.\n\nGod is flexible with our imperfections. In speaking about the eternal covenant of marriage, the Lord said that marriage is eternal in duration and godlike in quality. There was no possibility of divorce. Yet, as President Oaks has taught:\n\n&gt;In the temples of the Lord, couples are married for all eternity. But some marriages do not progress toward that ideal. Because \u201cof the hardness of \\[our\\] hearts,\u201d the Lord does not currently enforce the consequences of the celestial standard. He permits divorced persons to marry again without the stain of immorality specified in the higher law.\n\nThus, **even the nature of the covenant itself can be changed if the Lord sees that we need it**. The atonement allows him to give us space to be less than perfect, to make less than perfect promises, to receive versions of eternity that aren't our final lessons yet. Because of the atonement the consequences of change, of making mistakes, or \"doing it wrong\" are held back. And we move forward.\n\n**tl;dr:** the covenant is still made, no matter how it is packaged. And even though there is a \"perfect\" ordinance and covenant, we can still get by with our less-than-perfect selves and our less-than-perfect rituals thanks to the atonement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  it's worth noting that God even points out that our ordinances on earth aren't necessarily eternal, but that they are created to mirror and prepare for eternal things. For example, in D&amp;C 128:12, it is revealed that Baptism for the Dead is the eternal ordinance, and that Baptism is just made to \"accord\" with baptism of the dead. \"\\[Baptism\\] was instituted to form a relationship with the ordinance of baptism for the dead,\"", "edited": 1678808207.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about getting hitched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One girl I know had a wedding ceremony in a meadow above a river.
