The quality or mobility may be less than desired. *But* those may be acceptable tradeoffs, depending on the buyer.\n\nThe full Markward suit looks to be about $500, but I don't think I'd make that purchase. The breastplate, shoulders, and elbows all look very restrictive. And armor of that category tends to use thinner metal and weaker suede or bonded leather. The fit is really important for comfort and usability, and mass produced armor never fits anyone well. \n\nYou can get *most* of a really quality suit for about $500. A breastplate, bracers, front greaves, and knees/elbows can be had for about $500. Depending on your game or desired look, that might be enough. Add an extra $300 for riveted maille, and you have a lot of coverage. The helmet, articulated joints, pauldrons, full wrap greaves, and gauntlets are what brings the total to $2000 for good quality full suits. If you don't need or want the expensive pieces, skip em! \n\nRed Snake Armory (Mexico) Forge of Svan (Ukraine) and HBC Armor / Honour Kraft (India) seem to have quality armor that won't make you bankrupt. They're all buhurt armorers, so they're historic-ish. But also very focused on movement, durability, and utility. More fantasy style might have to come from elsewhere. Theres a lot of small scale manufacturers for the SCA and buhurt, but the cost:quality ratio can be wildly different between the shops. \n\nAn alternate category is the mass produced larp armor from places like Mytholon or Get Dressed For Battle. The Markward suit is an example of that. They equip *lots* of larpers because they're affordable and in-stock.  But there are major tradeoffs. Especially with their breastplates, pauldrons, and gorgets, you'll lose a *lot* of mobility. You'll save some more money, but lose out on quality and utility. Instead of fully wrapped bracers, you'll find half bracers for the outside of the forearm. Or instead of tight lames on the pauldrons, you'll get larger, looser fits. And maybe less rolled edges, and more that are simply deburred. The toughest part is you'll lose the ability for custom fits, though in-stock shipping is nice and quick. Fit and finish will be lacking and won't feel very authentic if you care about thickness and construction. \n\nNo name stuff from Amazon and Nautical Mart will disappoint anyone, and end up in a trash bin. Avoid that stuff. \n\nIf you're putting together a larp armor set, things don't need buhurt durability. 1.5mm/16 gauge will stand up to hard hits from steel weapons, but a larp armor set can settle for 1.2/18 gauge or even 1mm (check your local game rules). It'll bring the cost and weight down a lot. Historically, 1.5mm is pretty thick (unless we're talking about breastplates and helmets.)\n\nA breastplate and placket isn't the *only* way to stay flexible.
