The job of a middle manager is to understand your boss's intent, and the capabilities of your section. If your boss wants something done that your section can't do, you need to be able to push back on stuff. There's a couple of approaches you can take. Firstly the \"yes, but\" approach where you agree to do something, but request resources you don't have in order to get it done.\n\nAs an example: Your section is being tasked with running a range. Through your estimates and evaluation of the unit SOPs, you've determined you need 10 people to staff the range, but you only have 6 available to staff it. At this point, you have to be able to tell your boss \"no\" but in a way that doesn't make it look like you're shirking responsibilities. instead, you tell them \"yes, but I need an additional 4 personnel, and they need to be X rank\".\n\nSecondly, is reframing the intent. Maybe you have a commander who has a certain PACE plan they want used, but one of the types of equipment is currently outside of the unit's budget to properly maintain outside of deployments (JCRs anybody?). Is there a way to have soldiers train on a PACE plan without using that specific piece of equipment? Will the commander's intent still be met if you have to resort to alternate means of communication? Does not fixing this issue allow you to improve on other parts of the plan?\n\nThirdly, is taking care of your joes. NCOs make sure that everyone follows the plan, gets fed, etc... but as an officer you play a part in that as well. Ensure the plan is being executed, and find ways to give creature comforts to people where possible (shelter, food, water, etc...). The more comfy you can make the Army experience for your guys, the more they'll appreciate having you around. Help them progress their careers in ways that align with their goals.

If you want to become the next Olympic swimmer, or a boxer, or powerlifter, marathoner, etc... or recovering from an injury, or maybe you want to spend more energy on fixing your house..... whatever the case is, your motivation and energy is a limited resource.

He can opt for poke trading instead of all-in combos, there are options. Some of which are game dependent.\n\nFor the early game, if you're running into mana problems as yorick, you can run either Sorcery tree to have access to manaflow band, Precision tree for PoM, or Inspiration for biscuits. \n\nMy personal preference is manaflow band, so I'd be running the comet keystone with manaflow band, Transendence, and scorch. Secondly, Cho'gath is going to be relying on poke to get you down in HP. You can counteract Cho's poke damage by running Resolve as your secondary tree and taking one of the middle defensive runes like second wind or bone plating depending on how long you want your trades to last. If you think Cho will be able to Q+auto+e, it will be better to bring bone plating into the matchup. and for your last slot, you can either run demolish, revitalize, or unflinching. Unflinching will not be effective against Cho'gath's knockup, but it will lessen the impact of slows. revitalize will be helpful with boosting the sustain of your Q, and combos well with high cooldown reduction builds.\n\nfor early lane phase, I would start with manaflow band + two pots. on an early buy, you can get starter boots. Similar to an Aatrox, Cho'gath is much more able to deal with slow targets than fast targets, so buying early boots can help shut down a lot of his combos. For laning phase, the best 3 item purchase you can probably have against Cho'gath is Sunderers, Black Cleaver, and merc treads. The anti-tank nature of the items as well as the healing and movespeed bonuses are going to be great against Cho'gath. If you have a lot of kill pressure, you can enhance this with your 4th item Grudge, or a Bork if Cho'gath is needlessly tanky.\n\nFor your abilities in lane, by level 6 I'd want Q lv.2, W lv1, E lv.2 and R lv. 1. Depending on if you can actually land your E, I would max E, otherwise max Q. Your E ability has damage that scales with the target's current health, meaning it will be more effective against champions with large healthpools. Cho'gath is one of these champions with a large health pool. at level 1, your E has a cooldown of 12 seconds without ability haste, and by max rank, its on an 8 second cooldown. Additionally, as this ability does magic damage, it will make cho'gath's early itemization a little bit harder, as buying armor to shut down the effectiveness of ghouls will have no impact on Yorick's E magic damage. If Cho'gath buys any early armor whether for boots or for early bramble, going E max will give you much more early kill pressure on the Void Terror.\n\nFor trades on this build, you will generally be going for easy farm when available, and using your E to harass Cho'gath when he walks up to CS. Your largest moments of weakness will be when you are surrounded by minions as Cho'gath may have an easier time positioning his Q, and dealing heavy damage with his E. While your W can be used slightly defensively, Cho'gath relies on a lot of burst as a tank, so it may be better to rely on W as an aggresive tool instead to bait out important abilities like Cho'Gath's E, or to land one of your combos better. While it can be a shame for Cho'Gath to use his ultimate on your maiden, running a lot of ability haste in your build will allow you to quickly overcome this annoyance. If you have your maiden up, and you see Cho'Gath use his ultimate on a minion, you likely have the power to all-in him at this point as he will be lacking a lot of burst in his combo.\n\nWhile you have a dueling advantedge, pay attention to where the enemy jungler is. If the enemy jungler has roamed bottom for a gank (it is a bot prio meta), then you can take time to invade the enemy jungle and take either a small minion camp or buff. because cho has decent waveclear and sustain through killing minions, it is generally not recommended to try proxying him unless you're setting something up for your jungler or mid laner.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "undertaker", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "458,000+ mastery points"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t disagree with you... but counterpoint, Yorick can just run specific runes to deal with the weaknesses you point out.

If the enemy jungler has roamed bottom for a gank (it is a bot prio meta), then you can take time to invade the enemy jungle and take either a small minion camp or buff. because cho has decent waveclear and sustain through killing minions, it is generally not recommended to try proxying him unless you&amp;#39;re setting something up for your jungler or mid laner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11961pu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/yorickmains/comments/11961pu/uh_how_do_i_counter_this_annoying_champion/j9lpmfg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/yorickmains/comments/11961pu/uh_how_do_i_counter_this_annoying_champion/", "name": "t1_j9lpmfg", "author_flair_template_id": "0001db78-c6d8-11e6-9fc4-0ea75e2c4c78", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/yorickmains", "author_flair_text": "458,000+ mastery points", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677102561.0, "created_utc": 1677102561.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/yorickmains/comments/11961pu/uh_how_do_i_counter_this_annoying_champion/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[Satire] Vex is a negative gamer who does not meet Riot's standards for in-game chat behavior.
