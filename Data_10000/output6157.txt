This posture gets your lungs and wind pipe in the best position for easy and \"good\" breathing, which is essential to projection.\n\n* Like u/showmm said, you should be using your diaphragm to project. This means that once you are standing straight, breathe in and allow your tummy to expand rather than your shoulders to lift. Practice this a few times and try to release the air from your lungs slowly using your abdomen and diaphragm without \"clenching your throat up,\" again like u/showmm says.\n\n* Once you are standing and breathing well, pick a note that is comfortable to sing for you, not too high or too low. Sing that note using the syllable \"ha.\" Start very breathy and as you hold out the note, \"tighten\" your voice gradually until you sound like the girl from The Grudge or someone WAY overusing \"vocal fry,\" then gradually go back to a breathy sound.

Practice this a few times and try to release the air from your lungs slowly using your abdomen and diaphragm without &amp;quot;clenching your throat up,&amp;quot; again like &lt;a href=\"/u/showmm\"&gt;u/showmm&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you are standing and breathing well, pick a note that is comfortable to sing for you, not too high or too low. Sing that note using the syllable &amp;quot;ha.&amp;quot; Start very breathy and as you hold out the note, &amp;quot;tighten&amp;quot; your voice gradually until you sound like the girl from The Grudge or someone WAY overusing &amp;quot;vocal fry,&amp;quot; then gradually go back to a breathy sound. In the middle of the two extremes is your &amp;quot;sweet spot,&amp;quot; which should be the strongest and healthiest projecting voice for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true,
