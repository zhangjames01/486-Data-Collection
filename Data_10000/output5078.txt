I don&amp;#39;t think batches took me that long even when I brewed on my kitchen stove. Do you keep detailed notes on brew day with times? Looking back at notes would help you figure out where you can gain the most time. It might be that you are not doing things in an efficient order. For example, you might be milling grains, then starting to heat water, and then sitting idle while waiting for strike temp instead of starting to heat first, and then milling while waiting for heat up. If you want, I can take a pic to show you an example of my brew day notes to give you an idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11l34pq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/11l34pq/how_long_is_your_brew_day/jbbjetg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/11l34pq/how_long_is_your_brew_day/", "name": "t1_jbbjetg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678224096.0, "created_utc": 1678224096.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/11l34pq/how_long_is_your_brew_day/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Spicy beer", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 6, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "link_author": "EGardner76", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jb61c5x", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "FznCheese", "num_comments": 18, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11k4s5p", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_7z55k", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Personally, I would dose in the keg.
