A great business - but if your family farm wasn't organic when it was started, it is very difficult to revert to organic. Not to mention, if you could grow to that quality standard AT SCALE, you could no longer charge the prices those farms do today (supply and demand). Generally, higher overhead isn't too much of an issue for them, because they make a 'luxury' product.\n\nSmall farmers - usually family-based farms, often generational.

These guys are the ones who are not insignificant in number (especially in Maine) but are barely making enough to survive.

Don't like it... too bad, your entire crop gets to rot, and you get nothing. \n\nContract farmers (more common in the mid-west).  Still family farms, but this is the group that starts industrial-scale farming.  They are under contract from the likes of Con-Agra and are pretty much the equivalent of independent contractors.

Something like this:\n\n*Our son is immunocompromised. This means that any infection - bacterial or viral, is likely to be FATAL to him.  He is medically fragile. Our family knows this. MIL knows this. We have had to explain it repeatedly to her, as she insists she \"has a right\" to see our son, but doesn't want to adhere to the guidelines needed to keep our son SAFE - despite us being in a COVID hotspot.*\n\n*As a result, we have been forced to bar her from our home - but have offered to do video conferencing, etc so she can maintain a relationship with our family.  Evidently, this is not enough for MIL - she must see us in person. She is still unwilling to socially isolate or take any other precautions - but we are supposed to allow her to potentially kill our son with her fecklessness.*  \n\n*Today, BIL saw fit to give her the spare emergency key to our home, despite our wishes, and she let herself in - literally endangering our son's life. The grandmother who supposedly wants a relationship with us so badly that she is willing to kill her grandchild to get what she wants.  BIL is evidently more scared of hurting his mother's feelings than of contributing to the death of his nephew.  And FM1, FM2, and FM3 who have reached out to tell us off for hurting MIL's feelings apparently care more about a grown woman's unreasonable emotional bullshit than they do about the life of a little boy.*\n\n*For the record - y'all should be thoroughly ashamed of yourselves. You are all hereby notified that you are unwelcome in our home, we do not want to hear further ridiculous justifications from any of you.  We are going to protect our son from anyone who seeks to harm him - and that includes all of you.*", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent advice.
