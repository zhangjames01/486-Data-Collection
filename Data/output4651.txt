I typed a whole post about my perspective here, because I was checking in on Reddit again and saw your replies to my post, but then Reddit ate it and I don't have the energy to type it up again \\[edit: I typed up a different long post instead, what can I say\\].  Obviously a post a month after the thread died isn't for the karma, it's because I think that it's worth remembering that the people on the other side of the keyboard are humans like me, and that the world won't get better unless we try to honestly share our experiences and understand each other when we disagree.\n\nIn short: it's worth reading some accounts of folks who have actually talked to homeless folks, and hear their actual stories. If you like podcasts.  [According to Need](https://99percentinvisible.org/need/) is an excellent short series (five \\~1hr episodes) about homeless folks in the bay area, how they got there, and how the system to support them works or (mostly) doesn't work.\n\nAs for my story: I grew up in a rural lower-middle-class family, did well in school and worked my way through five years of college with very little outside support, and lived in city centers my whole adult life, including a decade living downtown in Portland where the housing crisis has only gotten worse. I live literally across the street from a park that has long been a congregation point for homeless folk, and my neighborhood has probably hundreds of tents nearby. My evenings frequently involve people down on the street shouting, arguing with someone or with themselves, clearly audible at 2am through my fourth-story windows. If I leave my apartment early in the morning there is often someone sleeping in the vestibule, and I pass countless homeless folks literally every day that I walk around my neighborhood. I've talked to probably hundreds of homeless folks over the years, and had my fair share of positive and negative encounters.\n\nSo, I am very far from a naive suburbanite, and since going to college have in fact never lived in anything resembling a suburb. And the perspective you share mostly just makes me sad, because it's far from unexpected. I realize it's comfortable and easy to believe that everyone who is on the street is responsible for their own fate, and that if they had just worked harder or gotten their shit together, they would be better off like you, and that you are where you are because you're responsible and hard-working and deserve it.\n\nI was raised to believe similar things as you about homeless folks and how they got there, but after hearing so many folks' stories, how they got to where they are, how difficult it is to pull yourself up when you have no one who cares about you or can help you out, when society as a whole treats you with contempt and as useless burdens who would be better off not existing...I just can't believe that any more.\n\nI don't know your story, of course, just as you don't know mine or any of the people on the street around me. But I look at my relatively meager childhood, and realize that there are so many invisible advantages and hands up I had all the same, that so many people haven't had. There are so many factors that we have no control over: the family we're born into, countless medical conditions, how the groups we are part of are treated by society, how well or conventionally our brain operates, where we are born, and so on.\n\nYes, we have some control over the choices we make in our lives. But I believe that many folks on the street could have been perfectly responsible and hard-working and savvy and still ended up where they are through no fault of their own, and I also believe that making some poor choices doesn't make you unworthy of basic human decency.\n\nI'm not asking you to help out, or to try to change anything, because those are hard problems that are hard to solve. But as one human to another, I hope that you might take a minute to consider that you don't know any of these people's stories, you have no way of knowing what separates their lives from yours, and to at least exercise a little compassion. It costs you nothing to smile and say \"sorry no\" when someone asks you for help.\n\nAnd yes, it's frustrating to have these folks' lives intersect with our own, to have them shouting outside our windows. But we live in a society that has so many holes to fall through, has such a miserable excuse for a social safety net, that that to me is just part of the tradeoff of living in a city.\n\nI realize it's easy and comfortable to tell yourself a story about how everyone who is on the streets could improve their situation if they just got their shit together, and their situation is therefore their fault...but that perspective fell apart when I spent time learning about how people end up on the streets, how poverty is a self-reinforcing spiral, and how woefully insufficient our social support for folks is. To me, living with the evidence of those failures is just part of the price of living in a society that creates those conditions in the first place. If I didn't want to be reminded of that, I would just...move to a suburb, honestly. But I think being compassionate and doing what I can to advocate for solutions that help people, rather than just making them someone else's problem, is a much better way.\n\nAnd I know there's a whole suite of rhetoric out there about how people don't want help, to reinforce the idea that people's situations are entirely their own making. From what I have lived and read and heard first-hand, that rhetoric ignores the facts and truth on the ground, in order to make us feel better about the uncomfortable reality of the deep inequality built into our system, and allows us to dismiss anyone who falls through the cracks as a failure who deserves their lot. It's easy, but from everything I've seen, it's an easy lie, encouraged by those whose power depends on you believing that the system works and is ready to help anyone who asks.\n\nIt's a lie that justifies suspending compassion and stripping the humanity of anyone who doesn't have enough money in the bank to survive in this system where simply getting enough food to eat and a safe place to sleep is absurdly expensive. Having that money means getting a job, and employers expect you to have your shit together. Unfortunately, getting your shit together requires having money, which...requires having a job. And so, people constantly fall through the cracks, and if you don't have savings or friends and family to rely on, you very quickly end up in that vicious cycle.\n\nI think the least we can give folks who have fallen through the cracks is a little basic human decency.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigh.
