I run GURPS right now and its notorious for having rules for everything, well thought out, logical good rules but pages and pages and pages  of rules none the less. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean GURPS  has 138 pages in two books of supplemental rules for using guns! (Tactical Shooting 88 pages, Gun Fu 50) alone &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now GURPS as a system is from the time of the OSR, its only three years younger than Moldvay D&amp;amp;D! but its the rules not ruling side of the OSR &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found it useful to just reverse that and use as few rules as I need to get things don. Trimming rules and trusting yourself and your players speeds up the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also giving hints where appropriate , i.e you have searched the room thoroughly and there is nothing of value, a bit new school in the sense you assume PC&amp;#39;s are professionals can really help.   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_9fvqpo", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/osr/comments/9fvqpo/escalation_mechanic_to_fight_the_15minute/e61r8hq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/9fvqpo/escalation_mechanic_to_fight_the_15minute/", "name": "t1_e61r8hq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/osr", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1537056561.0, "created_utc": 1537056561.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/9fvqpo/escalation_mechanic_to_fight_the_15minute/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2svde", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Escalation Mechanic to fight the 15-minute adventuring day?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "osr", "link_author": "XxST0RMxX", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "e5zqe9d", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "ABProsper", "num_comments": 27, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_9fvqpo", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_3h6wa", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm not fond of punishing  logical and sensible behavior in an OSR Game especially by illogical random encounters.
