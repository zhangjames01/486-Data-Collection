If people want adjustments, I prefer they call me, I do most maintenance for next to nothing (probably less than the cost of gas for getting there, if anything at all), however when they reprogram their controller and fuck with the sprinkler heads and I get a call on a Sunday morning that their system&amp;#39;s spraying in the street, their yard&amp;#39;s flooded, and the system is going on 10 times a day, and their excuse is that they saw just how I did it and tried to change things themselves, then it ends up costing them a lot of money and me a lot of time. Withheld information is better for everyone involved sometimes. I really appreciate people that like to learn about the systems, but it&amp;#39;s one of those &amp;quot;thinking you know is worse than not knowing&amp;quot; situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4bcac5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/4bcac5/etiquette_question_when_an_electrician_plumber/d1873jy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/4bcac5/etiquette_question_when_an_electrician_plumber/", "name": "t1_d1873jy", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HomeImprovement", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1458587982.0, "created_utc": 1458587982.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/4bcac5/etiquette_question_when_an_electrician_plumber/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s7tt", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Best thing about driving a Ford Escape; you don't get pulled over very often...", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 32, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AdviceAnimals", "link_author": "neocamel", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d185lj1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "username_00001", "num_comments": 2510, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d1854ym", "score": 32, "author_fullname": "t2_bq3ac", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It also has something to do with it being in your stomach I think, maybe the water dilutes that and helps it get out of your mouth.
