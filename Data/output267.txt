Matches run from hot wires to exploding bridge wires, simple DIY hot wire electric matches to low cost (and low output) electric matches avail on Amazon used for model rocketry to 1-amp 1-watt no-fire electric pyrotechnic initiators for more robust systems.  Regardless, a pyrotechnic firing train can be utilized to accommodate the electric match initiator that OP wants to use.\n\nA firing train would consist of an easily initiated first fire, potentially a secondary fire that would be tailored to the primary pyro charge, and then the pyro charge itself. Additionally, morphologies of the primary charge constituent(s) can (in some cases) be varied to improve initial ignition/reaction.\n\nIn the case of a Fe2O3 + Al (red iron oxide + aluminum) thermite, a hot enough slag (solid, solid/liquid, liquid rxn products; not gaseous rxn products) of a primary or secondary fire is required to ensure an adequate heat transfer rate to the thermite to start decomposition of the iron oxide and oxidization of the aluminum. \n\nAssuming an expensive model rocket type electric match (say from amazon), an example first fire composition that the electric match would be in direct contact with, would be 90 wt% Ti + 10 wt% KClO4 (Potassium perchlorate), with a particle size of approx. 15-40'ish microns for spherical Ti and 45-100'ish microns for chunky/sponge/irregular Ti (Electrostatic discharge ignition of the titanium is a concern for very fine particle sizes). Only a small amount of the first fire would be required to boost the output of the electric match - say 0.5 to 1 gram.  The electric match head should be partially to fully embedded in the first fire mix to increase probability of initiation.  \n\nFor a red iron oxide thermite - a secondary fire charge that is easily initiate than the primary thermite that I have used successfully is another thermate/thermite: Black iron oxide (Fe3O4) + Al; 0.75 Fe3O4 + 2 Al; using very fine black iron oxide and 10-25 micron Al. The reaction output is a hot molten mass with good heat transfer properties. Depending on charge configuration, 5 to 25 grams should be sufficient to initiate the red iron oxide thermite.\n\nSmaller particle sizes of the red iron oxide and aluminum for the main charge will allow easier initiation than larger sizes. Additionally, loose packing of the various mixes increases ease of ignition vs. hard packing/low porosity. However packing density is often dictated by end use and handling/environmental requirements - so more/less firing train materials would be required. Dry (water) mixes (1) reduce energy loss to steam formation, and (2) produce less gaseous reaction products, which will assist in the production of a well contained mass of molten-slag of iron/aluminum oxide from the thermite. And depending on the end use, a binder may be required for charge configuration stability with binder selection also influenced by end use requirements. Finally, a well mixed (homogeneous) charge will, usually, give better pyrotechnic output than one that is poorly mixed or with uneven constituent concentrations. \n\nSafety. Wear natural fiber clothing when handling metal powders and pyrotechnic mixtures to reduce static charge buildup on your person. Ground yourself to an earth ground (not an electrical system ground) to also reduce the risk of ESD. Non-conductive gloves (like latex gloves) to keep hands cleaner increase the ESD risk. Wear safety glasses or face shields. ABC type fire extinguishers do not put out pyrotechnic or burning metal fires, and may, in fact, blow burning/reacting material making the fire spread. D type fire extinguishers can be used on metal fires, but run the risk of spreading combusting materials. In case of a fire, evac to a safe distance and fire fight to contain the secondary fire growth. Sand or other non-flammable material may be poured over small pyrotechnic/metal fires to help contain the reaction/fire. **Water** becomes a reactant in metal/pyrotechnic fires and can act as an oxidizer and hydrogen generator (with subsequent hydrogen combustion with atmospheric oxygen) - ***do not use water to attempt to extinguish metal/pyrotechnic fires***. Keep the leads of the electric match shunted until ready to connect to firing system.

Depending on charge configuration, 5 to 25 grams should be sufficient to initiate the red iron oxide thermite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smaller particle sizes of the red iron oxide and aluminum for the main charge will allow easier initiation than larger sizes. Additionally, loose packing of the various mixes increases ease of ignition vs. hard packing/low porosity. However packing density is often dictated by end use and handling/environmental requirements - so more/less firing train materials would be required. Dry (water) mixes (1) reduce energy loss to steam formation, and (2) produce less gaseous reaction products, which will assist in the production of a well contained mass of molten-slag of iron/aluminum oxide from the thermite. And depending on the end use, a binder may be required for charge configuration stability with binder selection also influenced by end use requirements. Finally, a well mixed (homogeneous) charge will, usually, give better pyrotechnic output than one that is poorly mixed or with uneven constituent concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Safety. Wear natural fiber clothing when handling metal powders and pyrotechnic mixtures to reduce static charge buildup on your person. Ground yourself to an earth ground (not an electrical system ground) to also reduce the risk of ESD. Non-conductive gloves (like latex gloves) to keep hands cleaner increase the ESD risk. Wear safety glasses or face shields. ABC type fire extinguishers do not put out pyrotechnic or burning metal fires, and may, in fact, blow burning/reacting material making the fire spread. D type fire extinguishers can be used on metal fires, but run the risk of spreading combusting materials. In case of a fire, evac to a safe distance and fire fight to contain the secondary fire growth. Sand or other non-flammable material may be poured over small pyrotechnic/metal fires to help contain the reaction/fire. &lt;strong&gt;Water&lt;/strong&gt; becomes a reactant in metal/pyrotechnic fires and can act as an oxidizer and hydrogen generator (with subsequent hydrogen combustion with atmospheric oxygen) - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do not use water to attempt to extinguish metal/pyrotechnic fires&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep the leads of the electric match shunted until ready to connect to firing system. Play safe so that you can continue to play!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_tviy3l", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/chemistry/comments/tviy3l/had_a_go_at_making_thermite_it_was_very_difficult/i3b4drn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/tviy3l/had_a_go_at_making_thermite_it_was_very_difficult/", "name": "t1_i3b4drn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/chemistry", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1649042667.0, "created_utc": 1649042667.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://v.redd.it/purvpt2yhdr81"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w28m", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "New rule update - All comments must directly source a Bart Ehrman blog", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 11, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AcademicBiblical", "link_author": "BobbyBobbie", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i2z56tp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TooManyInLitter", "num_comments": 56, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ttjlxm", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_6jyfy", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; We want random blogs from 3 years ago.\n\nQuick question.
