Your grandparents were probably able to take out a mortgage, to buy a home in any neighborhood they so chose. I'm sure they weren't forced by black codes to live in a specific part of any community. Your grandparents probably could take out loans to become business owners and achieve at least a small degree of financial autonomy.\n\nEven if they weren't business owners, your grandparents could probably take jobs that allowed them to ascend from the abject poverty you describe e.g. secretarial work, sales jobs, bank teller etc. They probably had options other than domestic work, custodial work, or the military.\n\nI'm not sure if your grandparents or parents applied to college, but if they did, their applications weren't immediately trashed based on the color of their skin. If your grandfather fought in WWII he could probably take full advantage of the GI Bill and accrue even more credentials (besides not being colored) which gave him even more opportunity to build a stable, autonomous life.\n\nAgain, I'm not sure of your ethnic heritage, but I do know that, simply by virtue of being black one is often vilified and looked down upon. For centuries in this country, simply being black lowered society's expectations of, and respect for an entire group of people. My great-grandparents were denied access to quality education--they had to attend the Colored high schools with fewer resources. My grandparents lived in ghettos because banks wouldn't give home loans to blacks and because owners refused to sell to black clients anyway. They were poor, social pariahs, but they were hardworking and dignified. They raised brilliant and hardworking children who, in turn, raised me, a child of the 90s.\n\nI've far surpassed many of my teachers' low expectations of me, a black girl.

My parents wanted to rent a house in a nice neighborhood when my dad was transitioning jobs. The landlord was all ready to go after several phone interviews but when we showed up in our black skin, she never called them back to finalize the lease. When my dad came to sign a form a school one day my geometry teacher was utterly flabbergasted to see him--a well-groomed, well-spoken financial analyst--a black man heavily involved in his child's life. I've been described as \"surprisingly articulate,\" \"shockingly high-achieving given my (decidedly middle class) background,\" \"so pretty...for a black girl,\" and \"not really black\" despite the fact that I have black features, including a 'fro, black parents, black grandparents and black great-grandparents.\n\nHow does this have an impact on me today? I have to be a constant counterexample to the stereotype in order to undermine the racist bullshit I deal with every. single. fucking. day. Everyday I have to prove that I am intelligent, capable, clean, conventionally attractive. When my white friends acted out in high school it was written off as regular antics. I didn't get that \"luxury.\" When my white friends achieved middling grades in college, they didn't have to worry because in the minds of employers, it didn't automatically mean that they were unqualified. I didn't have that \"luxury.\" When my white friends get shit-faced in public and act as people in their early 20's do, no one bats an eye; none of them would ever get arrested. I don't have that \"luxury.\" \n\nJust as the things that happened to my great-grandparents affect my behavior everyday, the things that happened to your great-grandparents affect yours.

My parents wanted to rent a house in a nice neighborhood when my dad was transitioning jobs. The landlord was all ready to go after several phone interviews but when we showed up in our black skin, she never called them back to finalize the lease. When my dad came to sign a form a school one day my geometry teacher was utterly flabbergasted to see him--a well-groomed, well-spoken financial analyst--a black man heavily involved in his child&amp;#39;s life. I&amp;#39;ve been described as &amp;quot;surprisingly articulate,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;shockingly high-achieving given my (decidedly middle class) background,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;so pretty...for a black girl,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not really black&amp;quot; despite the fact that I have black features, including a &amp;#39;fro, black parents, black grandparents and black great-grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does this have an impact on me today? I have to be a constant counterexample to the stereotype in order to undermine the racist bullshit I deal with every. single. fucking. day. Everyday I have to prove that I am intelligent, capable, clean, conventionally attractive. When my white friends acted out in high school it was written off as regular antics. I didn&amp;#39;t get that &amp;quot;luxury.&amp;quot; When my white friends achieved middling grades in college, they didn&amp;#39;t have to worry because in the minds of employers, it didn&amp;#39;t automatically mean that they were unqualified. I didn&amp;#39;t have that &amp;quot;luxury.&amp;quot; When my white friends get shit-faced in public and act as people in their early 20&amp;#39;s do, no one bats an eye; none of them would ever get arrested. I don&amp;#39;t have that &amp;quot;luxury.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as the things that happened to my great-grandparents affect my behavior everyday, the things that happened to your great-grandparents affect yours. Maybe you&amp;#39;re just not mindful enough to realize it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR the things that happened to anyone&amp;#39;s great-grandparents profoundly impact one&amp;#39;s behavior today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1ilrr5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WTF/comments/1ilrr5/essay_from_teacher_in_a_black_highschool/cb5u5t1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1ilrr5/essay_from_teacher_in_a_black_highschool/", "name": "t1_cb5u5t1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WTF", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1374220499.0, "created_utc": 1374220499.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://harrisburg.craigslist.org/rnr/3901646435.html"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh61", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Essay from teacher in a black highschool", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "WTF", "link_author": "PutZeCandleBack", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cb5trbj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "reformedamishama", "num_comments": 509, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cb5rnre", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_7izp0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "No proper punctuation", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No proper punctuation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1ilrr5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/WTF/comments/1ilrr5/essay_from_teacher_in_a_black_highschool/cb5trbj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1ilrr5/essay_from_teacher_in_a_black_highschool/", "name": "t1_cb5trbj", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/WTF", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1374218332.0, "created_utc": 1374218332.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://harrisburg.craigslist.org/rnr/3901646435.html"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Gay people of Reddit, what are things straight people don't know about being in a gay couple?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "fidiba", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cb2nvwm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "reformedamishama", "num_comments": 817, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cb2n7f7", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_7izp0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sure, lots of women from various positions on the sexual spectrum don't wear fake nails.
