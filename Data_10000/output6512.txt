So yes, it would be good if they got a share of the profits - and besides that, it would be good &lt;em&gt;for the business.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/05/19/worker-cooperatives-employee-owned-businesses/\"&gt;Worker-owned cooperatives are less likely to fail&lt;/a&gt; than conventionally-run small businesses or publicly-traded companies. Giving workers a share of the profits means you attract &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; workers who are more motivated to see the company do well (as opposed to regular wage workers who get paid the same no matter what the profit margins are.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But like I said, the reason why this type of business isn&amp;#39;t more common is probably because people who start businesses tend to want control how the business is run, and make as much money for themselves as they can. Worker ownership means giving up control and getting less money, and so even thought it might make the business more resilient and attract workers who are better and more motivated, it&amp;#39;s a lot less popular.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11qp1bi", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskALiberal/comments/11qp1bi/how_do_you_feel_about_capitalism/jch98i7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/11qp1bi/how_do_you_feel_about_capitalism/", "name": "t1_jch98i7", "author_flair_template_id": "d75d36b8-75d7-11e7-b8bf-0ef4c40e4f5c", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskALiberal", "author_flair_text": "Democratic Socialist", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678998781.0, "created_utc": 1678998781.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/11qp1bi/how_do_you_feel_about_capitalism/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "CMV: Whilst learning about lived experience is important, deferring to people for answers on what one should or shouldn't do, purely because of their unchosen characteristics, is illogical and ironically bigoted.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "changemyview", "link_author": "H0w-1nt3r3st1ng", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jch4zp3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "MercuryChaos", "num_comments": 104, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcd1cnq", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_34cxm", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;someone's solutions re: how to solve a problem are not inherently less or more valid because of their UCs.
