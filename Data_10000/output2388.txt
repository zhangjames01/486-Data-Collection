The new layout at SLC will also be fairly similar, as is the the layout at Dulles. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having one central terminal and satellite concourses has some good advantages - all gates are accessible for connecting flights without having to exit and re-enter security. Also, when you have several different security entrances each serving a small number of gates with only one or two lines, that also means can get backed up badly if there happen to be a few flights leaving at the same time from that area - it&amp;#39;s more efficient to be able to average out the whole airports demand rather than the demand of a few gates. The disadvantage of DIA&amp;#39;s design is it takes longer to get from your gate to the exit (or the other way around) because it&amp;#39;s so sprawled out and taking the train adds an extra step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the major misses in terms of the layout are just the lack of redundancy for the train and the insufficient space for security (not really their fault because it was planned pre-9/11). I guess another miss is that they could have used the A-line to connect to rental car agencies and off-site hotels instead of shuttle busses if they had built out the A-line when the airport was initially developed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11p3j87", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Denver/comments/11p3j87/trains_arent_working_at_dia/jbwmwpq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/11p3j87/trains_arent_working_at_dia/", "name": "t1_jbwmwpq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Denver", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678607509.0, "created_utc": 1678607509.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/gnwzqd62n9na1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qstm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Is it better to put money in my mortgage or student loan?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "personalfinance", "link_author": "Brazda25", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jb3865b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "people40", "num_comments": 17, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11j8kcs", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_57f9c", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "In addition to what others have said, it's worth noting that attacking the student loan debt likely has tax advantages, *if you itemize your deductions and depending on the amount of each loan*.
