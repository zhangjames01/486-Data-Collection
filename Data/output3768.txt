I don't care.\n\n&gt;I don't use governmental assistance or food stamps / ebt, yet I pay for it and consider that a human right.\n\nEBT is not a human right.  That's government mandated charity.\n\n&gt;I don't have kids yet I pay for public school.\n\nProperty taxes are just stealing.  Parents should be the ones  paying for their children's education and expenses.  Their choice to have children, not mine.  We shouldn't have to pay for them.\n\n&gt;There is a price to pay for living in a society that functions well and **promises basic guarantees.**\n\nFound your problem right here.  There are no guarantees that you will receive what you are promised by the government.\n\n&gt;Some sort of taxation is necessary to perform even the most basic of government functions (such as protection of personal property and wealth), and that can only be done by collecting on the fruits of someone else's labor.\n\nSure, and the basic funcitons of government can be accomplished for much less than they take in taxes now.  Reducing the size of the government is the easiest way to reduce the cost of the government.\n\n&gt;So if you really want to discuss whether the government can collect any taxes at all (e.g. has the right to someone else's labor), then we're having a different discussion altogether.\n\nClearly it has been established by the Constitution that the government has the legal authority to collect taxes.  The question is how much and what services they provide with those taxes.\n\n&gt;If we want to go down that route, we also need to consider that nothing is a \"right\" in and of itself when you get down to brass tacks, and there's no set definition of what a government is obligated to protect for you and provide for you.\n\nWe have the Bill of Rights that does this for us in the USA.  Not sure what country you live in, but our rights have been defined by the government, and they do not include services that the government provides for you.  The government is obligated to abide by the Constitution and all of it's amendments.  That's all it's legally obligated to protect.  There is no product or service that the federal government grants you the right to.  Local governments are a different story.\n\n&gt;The government doesn't technically need to provide public schools, fire stations, a CDC, or so many other things.  \n\nCorrect.\n\n&gt;I personally believe that a well-functioning government built for the betterment of its citizens should also ensure that its citizens have access to a level of health care as a basic tenet.\n\nThe government doesn't exist to take care of you.  Anything the government has the power to provide, they also have the power to take away.  Unless you want Trump making decisions about your healthcare coverage, keep the government out of healthcare.  The person occupying the White House should be irrelevant to your everyday life.\n\n&gt;I guess your post makes it clear that anyone who believes that people should feel entitled to health care should NOT vote Republican?\n\nYes, that's fair to say.  Republicans don't believe in a nanny state.\n\nEdited for my terrible formatting.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hey, I bike to work, yet I have to pay for expensive highways and local road upkeep that I don&amp;#39;t use or cause strain on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a choice you make, not an inherent condition you have.  This is not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My house has never caught fire, yet I still have to pay taxes for the fire station.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You pay those taxes so that the service will be there if your house catches on fire.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I pay for NASA to conduct space-related missions despite not getting to go on any of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your taxes don&amp;#39;t go to NASA for rides in space.  Your benefit comes from the massive amounts of research they conduct, which gets applied on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I pay every year for tanks and military equipment that I, as well as high-ranking military personnel themselves, don&amp;#39;t believe is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get rid of them.  I don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t use governmental assistance or food stamps / ebt, yet I pay for it and consider that a human right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EBT is not a human right.  That&amp;#39;s government mandated charity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have kids yet I pay for public school.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Property taxes are just stealing.  Parents should be the ones  paying for their children&amp;#39;s education and expenses.  Their choice to have children, not mine.  We shouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a price to pay for living in a society that functions well and &lt;strong&gt;promises basic guarantees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Found your problem right here.  There are no guarantees that you will receive what you are promised by the government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some sort of taxation is necessary to perform even the most basic of government functions (such as protection of personal property and wealth), and that can only be done by collecting on the fruits of someone else&amp;#39;s labor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, and the basic funcitons of government can be accomplished for much less than they take in taxes now.  Reducing the size of the government is the easiest way to reduce the cost of the government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if you really want to discuss whether the government can collect any taxes at all (e.g. has the right to someone else&amp;#39;s labor), then we&amp;#39;re having a different discussion altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clearly it has been established by the Constitution that the government has the legal authority to collect taxes.  The question is how much and what services they provide with those taxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If we want to go down that route, we also need to consider that nothing is a &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; in and of itself when you get down to brass tacks, and there&amp;#39;s no set definition of what a government is obligated to protect for you and provide for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have the Bill of Rights that does this for us in the USA.  Not sure what country you live in, but our rights have been defined by the government, and they do not include services that the government provides for you.  The government is obligated to abide by the Constitution and all of it&amp;#39;s amendments.  That&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s legally obligated to protect.  There is no product or service that the federal government grants you the right to.  Local governments are a different story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The government doesn&amp;#39;t technically need to provide public schools, fire stations, a CDC, or so many other things.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I personally believe that a well-functioning government built for the betterment of its citizens should also ensure that its citizens have access to a level of health care as a basic tenet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The government doesn&amp;#39;t exist to take care of you.  Anything the government has the power to provide, they also have the power to take away.  Unless you want Trump making decisions about your healthcare coverage, keep the government out of healthcare.  The person occupying the White House should be irrelevant to your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I guess your post makes it clear that anyone who believes that people should feel entitled to health care should NOT vote Republican?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;#39;s fair to say.
