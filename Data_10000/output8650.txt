In a hushed voice, he told Wilson there was a cat nearby.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living in Foothill Ranch for 21 years and have been just dying to see a cat,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo I held my phone and ran the video, but I didn\u2019t see anything. I decided to turn around and just as I glanced into the dry stream bed, I saw him cruising down it slowly. He passed by me and never looked at me.\n\n\u201cThe way his front shoulders moved, he seemed so capable and powerful.\u201d\n\n\nSince the cat was traveling down, Wilson decided to continue uphill and head toward where he had planned to meet his friend at Four Corners. They considered taking a longer way out of the park, but decided to return the same way Wilson had come.\n\nHalfway back, they encountered several park rangers walking through the brush with shovels, Wilson said. The area was within 50 feet of where he had seen the large cat.\n\nThe rangers told Wilson they were looking for a deer carcass that apparently had been drug around by a mountain lion, according to other reports they received.\n\nIn his near-daily rides, Wilson said he has seen more deer. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2019 just everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThose mountain lions have a buffet and are just lounging around.\u201d\n\nCapt. Patrick Foy, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said the public should expect to see mountain lions in Whiting Ranch. As long as they don\u2019t pose a threat, their presence there is not a concern.\n\nOn Sunday, Wilson headed out into the park again. He asked a ranger about a sign posted near the entrance announcing the last mountain lion encounter was on Nov. 25.\n\nHe said he was told a sighting is not considered a public safety threat until a lion engages with someone or threatens them.\n\n\u201cHe said, if the lion isn\u2019t paying attention to you, it\u2019s not a threat,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to call it a sighting, there has to be an encounter like locking eyes or hissing.\u201d\n\nDr. Scott Weldy, a Lake Forest wildlife veterinarian, said seeing lions in Whiting Ranch is not uncommon.\n\n\u201cLions roam through there and we have encounters when there are juveniles,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be careful.\n\n\u201cSometimes, people present themselves as prey items,\u201d he said. \u201cThey put themselves into positions that cats might find attractive. You take a child into a zoo, and a squealing child always gets a cat to stalk them.\u201d\n\nWeldy credits county officials for proactively protecting humans and wildlife.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to eliminate human influence,\u201d he said of the decision to close off access to the park.\n\n\u201cThe cat isn\u2019t smart enough to know the effects of its actions and could end up dead,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it starts causing problems and attacks someone, Fish and Wildlife are forced to euthanize it or move it. Until these animals get educated that humans are bad, it\u2019s wise to eliminate the key player from the game.\u201d\n\nA year ago, a mountain lion was killed by Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Deputies after it injured a 3-year-old Lake Forest boy and then hid out in a tree.\n\nIn California, there have been 16 attacks recorded in 100 years, three of them fatal, including a 2004 case in Whiting Ranch.\n\nWeldy said he has been treating a young mountain lion cub at the Serrano Animal &amp; Bird Hospital since Christmas when it was struck by a car on the 241 toll road. The animal suffered a head injury and a fractured pelvis, but is recovering.\n\nJust hours before it was struck, Wedly said cameras at his Bird of Prey Sanctuary, which is a mile from where the cat was hit, picked up images of it and a larger cat, possibly a sibling.\n\nAnd, just days ago, another mountain lion was killed on a roadway in the area.\n\nWeldy commends the riders for reacting correctly and getting away from the cat that was not engaging with them. \u201cThey did all the right things to get out of there.\u201d\n\nWilson, who said he had his personal best riding record the day he saw the mountain lion, thinks about more than just his speed and breathing now.\n\n\u201cI used to be the typical, head-down biker,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m rubber-necking around side-to-side.\u201d", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park has been closed indefinitely due to an uptick in recent mountain lion activity, authorities announced Sunday, Feb. 7.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 2,500-acre park with its canyons and streams, is a popular place to hike and mountain bike and offers 23 trails that wind through it for 17 miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Sunday afternoon, a park maintenance worker witnessed an encounter between a mountain lion and a family with a young child, said Marisa O\u2019Neil, spokeswoman for OC Parks.

The animal suffered a head injury and a fractured pelvis, but is recovering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just hours before it was struck, Wedly said cameras at his Bird of Prey Sanctuary, which is a mile from where the cat was hit, picked up images of it and a larger cat, possibly a sibling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, just days ago, another mountain lion was killed on a roadway in the area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weldy commends the riders for reacting correctly and getting away from the cat that was not engaging with them. \u201cThey did all the right things to get out of there.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wilson, who said he had his personal best riding record the day he saw the mountain lion, thinks about more than just his speed and breathing now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI used to be the typical, head-down biker,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m rubber-necking around side-to-side.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_lfogx1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/orangecounty/comments/lfogx1/whiting_mountain_lion_sightings/gmmwwpd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/lfogx1/whiting_mountain_lion_sightings/", "name": "t1_gmmwwpd", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/orangecounty", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1612825822.0, "created_utc": 1612825822.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2021/02/08/whiting-ranch-wilderness-park-closed-after-recent-mountain-lion-sightings/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Democrats' $50,000 student loan forgiveness plan would make 36 million borrowers debt-free", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "link_author": "WillNick", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gm5ael3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dogfacegremlin", "num_comments": 8841, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gm4zgu1", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_5bkr6", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think we need to reward and make things merit based.
