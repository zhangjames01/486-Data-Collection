The idea is not to over-estimate how much you could save, and end up either running yourself into the red because you're trying to save everything, or end up not being able to save anything because your goals weren't practical.\n\nI started thinking about it last July, and implemented my savings plan last August.\n\nI made three monthly estimates, each a couple hundred dollars apart, and thumped it all out in an Excel spreadsheet. They were my \"what I could save if best case\", \"how much I'll likely save\", and \"this is my established minimum of what I'll save, no exceptions\". That worst-case value was definitely doable for me, so I knew it was my bottom rung.\n\nThen, month by month, I laid out how it would look. My apartment lease is up at the end of June, so I calculated until May. \"At the end of May, I'll have ___.\"\n\nNext, you need to set an achievable expectation for a home value. It's good to talk to a lender to get \"pre-qualified\" (yes, it'll niggle your credit), because they'll be able to tell you the maximum loan amount your current financial profile could afford. It takes into account debt-to-income ratio, credit history, job standing, etc., so it's good to keep your debt as low as you can and don't default on payments. The pre-qualification is merely an indication of your standing; you're not approved for anything yet.\n\nLet's say you're pre-qualified for a loan roughly equivalent to mine: $200,000.\n\nWe can't use my example any more than this, because my lease is up in June, and that's four months away. Let's make up a new scenario. Say *your* lease was up at the end of February 2014, and you were calculating savings up until January '14. Divide it out. How much do you need to save to accumulate your down payment on a $200k loan? If you're saving 5%, that's ten grand you need for a down payment. *Don't forget closing costs!* Look at mine; they're a couple thousand dollars. So your down payment isn't the only money you'll have to save. Over-estimate a little. If you're trying to save 5% down payment? Try for 8%, just to make sure you cover your bases (more accurate information from a lender). So, 8% of $200k is sixteen thousand dollars.\n\nThere are eleven months between now and January '14. That means you'd have to save $1,450 every month to accumulate $16,000 to cover your costs.\n\nThat's basically your minimum. If you were to calculate a \"best case\" scenario, you'd aim for probably 10% of the loan value: twenty thousand bucks. Between now and January, you'd have to save $1,800 to make that goal.\n\nThat's really it, and really all I did. I started far back enough, and thankfully my apartment lease accommodated my needs by being a long ass-lease, and stuck to it. I faltered here and there, because I got married in the middle of it, but I kept adjusting the calculations and making sure I was still good.\n\n**TL/DR:** Realistic expectations, careful calculation -- seriously, project it all the way until your intended date of purchase, and try to over-save.\n\nPlanning it is the easy part. *Doing* it takes balls. And if you can save a few hundred dollars every month, you've got balls. Because those few hundred dollars can be easily frittered away into recreation. Your friends will be doing it, or they'll be buying computers, gaming consoles, sweet motorcycles, etc., and you have to be the responsible one, saving your shit. I've been there. *Keep saving.*\n\nSorry if it was a little long. :)\n\n**Edit:** That was before I discovered [Mint.com](https://wwws.mint.com/overview.event), which I could have used to formulate a budget, goals, and look at all my finances and balances in one spot.

If you have any contacts that dealt with or know an agent, talk to them about it.\n\n[pixeltarian's comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/196ri1/real_estate_agents_of_reddit_what_must_a_person/c8laucq) were really good in terms of physical value of the property, so I'll leave that part alone.\n\nI just finished preparing all of the financials with my lender, Joe, and am going to share the \"estimated cash to close\" worksheet he gave me:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Dku9Ok6\n\nNote: I'm going for a **Conventional** loan and putting forth a **five percent down payment.** \n\nNow, I'm not a whiz on this, but I'll walk you through my understanding of the worksheet.\n\n***Estimated Closing Costs***\n\n* Processing fee: pretty standard charge for using the lending agency. You won't be able to avoid this, but you might be able to get a different cost for different lenders.\n\n* Underwriting fee: Joe is really a broker, doing all the leg-work for the lending agency, and when he gets all of my information and sends it to them, they need to do some processing shit as well. That's what this is. Again, unavoidable charge, but you might be able to get a better price from a different lender.\n\n* Charge for Rate: this may or may not apply to you. When you do your negotiations with a lender, you have the ability to spend more money now (at closing) and take some percentages off the interest rate. The general way this works is 1% of the loan value (in my case, the loan value is $207,000, so 1% of that = $2,070) will drop your interest rate by 0.25%. So if I dropped an additional $2k, my interest rate would have been 3.75%. Your lender can tell you more about this stuff, but the Charge for Rate is because I \"locked in\" my interest rate at 4% for forty-five days. During this forty-five days, if the interest rates fluctuate, it don't matta to me none, because I'm locked in. This is a standard practice, but you may or may not incur rate charges, depending on how you wanna massage your interest rate.\n\n* Appraisal Fee: unless you want to accept the seller's appraisal (generally independently done, so probably no worries about biases), get an appraisal of the value of the house. For example, the original list price of the house I'm looking at was $215k. The appraised value was $207k, which is obviously good for me.\n\n* 1104 Lender's Policy Premium: honestly, no clue what this is. A charge for their service, I presume.\n\n* Settlement / Closing Fee: when you close on the house, there's more paperwork to be filed. Guess who does that work? Yep, not you.\n\n* Courier's Fee: bitches be mailin' shit.\n\n* Owner's Title Insurance (Seller Pd): apparently, my seller paid these costs, which may be pretty standard. Not sure. Depends on what your initial offer to the seller entails, and what gets sorted out.\n\n* Recording Charges Mortgage: you better believe there's administrative fees for the county and recorder's offices to process your stuff.\n\n**Total Estimated Closing Costs:** I'm paying $3.2k *on top of* the 5% down payment.\n\n***Estimated Prepaid Expenses***\n\nThese are things like insurance and taxes that are put into an account and, from there, used to pay for those fees. This is probably going to be a pretty standard operating procedure, depending, I guess, on where you live. This is cash that goes *directly* toward the costs that support you owning a house; it isn't given to the lender, or the realtor, or anybody as a surcharge. This money benefits you.\n\n***Cash to Close***\n\n* Purchase Price: like I said above, the appraised value of the home is $207,000.\n\n* Prepaids: we just did this above. werd.\n\n* Closing Costs: yodawg, we coo'.\n\n***So now we're here:***\n\nFive percent of $207,000 is $10,350. If you take the 5% away from $207k, you're left with $196,650 as the *actual* loan amount that I'll be paying. This figure is what the interest is calculated upon, etc.\n\nNow, there are seller concessions that were worked into the offer on the house, which means they're coming a little bit of the way to help me buy their house from them. They're paying 1% of the original loan value ($2,070) towards my closing costs. Pretty fuckin' awesome, amirite?\n\n**Deposit:** this money is often called an \"earnest money deposit\", which is generally given when the seller accepts the initial offer on the house and demonstrates that you're serious about the offer. Your lender will have policies about how or when it gets refunded (or not).\n\nAll these additions and subtractions result in me having to bring a grand total of $11,666.40 to the table when I want to close on the house. After I sign over that amount, this beautiful $207k home is mine.\n\n***Estimated Monthly Payment***\n\nYou need to pay attention and be careful about this field. You might be able to afford $11,666.40 to close on a house, but maybe shit goes wrong and you can't pay the actual monthly cost. This area is where the taxes, insurance, and any other monthly fees are factored in.\n\nSo I might have a great mortgage at $938.84 a month, but lookit all those fees.\n\n* Hazard Insurance: taken from the **Prepaid Expenses** area to the left ($96.50 every two months = $48.25 every month).\n\n* Real Estate Taxes: depends where you live. The realtor will be able to provide you this information before you ever go to a lender.\n\n* Mortgage Insurance: I guess this depends where you live and what kind of loan you get. For me, on a Conventional loan, if I don't put down **twenty percent** of the home value (20% of $207k = $41,400) at closing, the lending institution wants to cover their asses in case I can't make the mortgage payments. So what do they do? Charge me more on top of the mortgage payment. Once I've paid off 20% of the home value, this mortgage insurance goes away. Life's a bitch, ain't it?\n\n* Homeowners Assoc Dues: depends where you live! HOA fees like this aren't too bad. I'm happy to have the HOA.\n\n***And there you have a financial breakdown of buying a house.***\n\nPM me with questions or if I done goofed something in here.\n\nCheers,\n\n  David\n\n**Edit:** I a number.
