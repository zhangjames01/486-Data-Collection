What happens if getting super powers is horrific and painful and not something anyone should want? What happens if the villains are both truly vile *and* clever? What happens if the world of superheroes is actually bleak and terrible?\n\n* Reconstruction - Put the two together: super heroes are just people, and people are flawed. *But*, normal people also often rise to the occasion and find greatness within themselves. We can humanize the heroes by showing their flaws, and then showing them *overcome* those flaws, not with super powers but just by being normal, decent people who happen to have super powers. Our heroes are human *and* super. The villains *can* be truly vile and evil but good can triumph anyway.\n\nOr, giant robot anime:\n\n* Gundam - Giant robots are fun, this is escapism, everyone wishes they could be a giant robot pilot because it would be fuckin' *rad*. Don't take this too seriously, just sit back and enjoy the 80s power ballads.\n\n* Evangelion - Yeah but what if it's really *not* fun, at all, for anyone involved? What if they're not even *really* robots, but some kind of weird creature? You should take this *very* seriously and contemplate human nature.\n\n* Gurren Lagann - Ok, yeah, maybe being a giant robot pilot would be super scary for a kid because, yeah, you might die. It's still cool af. We can contemplate human nature *and* have fun.\n\nJazz:\n\n* Big band swing (eg Glenn Miller) - Music is there to make you happy and fill the background with something enjoyable. If it isn't complicated, it's more accessible and everyone can enjoy it, and dance to it. And if they're dancing, it means the music is great.\n\n* Bebop (Thelonius Monk) - The world sucks right now because of *another* World War. If you're dancing it means you aren't paying attention to the terrible war and, more importantly, you aren't paying attention to *me* and how great of a musician I am. Our music is deliberately too fast to dance to and uses weird time signatures and complex polyrhythms to show off how good we are.

However, carbon-14 is radioactive and will fall apart over time.\n\nSome small percentage of carbon is C-14. It gets replenished by high-energy cosmic rays hitting carbon in the upper atmosphere. As plants do their photosynthesis thing, they are taking in carbon and some of that carbon will be C-14. As long as the plant is *alive*, the plant will be constantly using and refreshing all of the carbon in its body, so ratio of C-12 to C-14 will stay pretty constant. Once the plant dies, the carbon doesn't get recycled anymore so as the C-14 decays, the ratio changes over time. Looking at that ratio gives an approximate age for when the plant died. All of that is also true of animals that eat the plants and animals that eat the animals that eat the plants.\n\nThere are other elements with longer half-lives, meaning they last longer, that can be used to date things older than what carbon is accurate for.\n\nHowever, that is not the only way to date remains. Another way is by looking at the layers of rock and earth that the remains were found in. If you look at pictures of places like [the Grand Canyon](https://grandcanyonwest.com/wp-content/uploads/SkwalkHero_B.jpg), you can see pretty distinct layers made of slightly different colors. As the environment changes over the ground, different kinds of rock with different materials get deposited and formed into a new layer of rock. This might be lava or ash from a volcano, silt and mud from a flood or inland sea, layers scraped away by glaciers, etc.\n\nRemains found in the same layer of rock probably came from around the same time. If one set of remains are dated using radiometric dating, other remains in the same layer can be said to be from that same time; and, radiometric dating on all of the remains found in that layer can confirm and verify that the radiometric dating is consistent. Scientists also have a pretty good idea by now when certain kinds of living things evolved, or when certain animals were very commonly found. So for example, if they find a trilobite fossil next to a dinosaur skeleton, that will make them question the dates because they know that trilobites and dinosaurs were from very different ages and shouldn't be found together.\n\nRadiometric dating can also be used on inorganic elements found within that layer. For example, a period of intense volcanic activity might put down a lot of volcanic ash containing heavy radioactive elements normally found deep in the Earth. Radiometric dating can be used on those elements to figure out when that period happened, and any remains found within that rock layer probably came from around that time. Similarly, large events may leave a very obvious sign in the rock layer that can be used to date remains found in that layer. For example, the asteroid impact that killed off the dinosaurs deposited huge amount of rock and dust all over the planet, leaving a layer that can be found just about everywhere. We can use other methods to put a time for that impact, and then look for that layer all over the world.\n\nScientists can look at *relative* layers, based on how quickly (on average) the Earth changes. So, if they find remains *above* the asteroid impact layer, they know that the remains came a while after the impact. If the remains are also *below* another known rock layer, that narrows down when the remains must have gotten there: sometime between when the asteroid hit and when this other layer formed. Scientists can also look at certain kinds of weathering to put a date to a rock layer. They can study how long it takes certain kinds of rock to erode and look at the condition of the rock to say, it was probably exposed for X amount of time.\n\nNo one method is used: remains are always investigated thoroughly using as many different ways to date them as possible.
