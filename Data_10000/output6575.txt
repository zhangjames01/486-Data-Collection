Getting a duplicate light cavalry unit every time you build one is so incredibly powerful, especially given how early horsemen can be unlocked, how good they are well into the industrial era, and how much production and future value that ends up saving you.

So to deal with those problems I do a few things. Great generals and optimizing for flanking for combat strength bonus, plus strategic promotions and farm pillaging for healing, plus combing units into corps and armies to make them stronger, plus making sure my encampments and harbors are built up so that units receive exp bonuses form those districts' buildings. I always go for a religion because not only can you pick the beliefs that suit you the best, but converting a newly captured city to your religion easily with inquisitors adds +6 loyalty against civs following other religions. And for science and culture and gold I make sure to pillage everything I can before taking over a city, because rebuilding districts and tiles takes very little time and practically zero cost in comparison to how long it would take to naturally generate the amount that you can pillage from them.
