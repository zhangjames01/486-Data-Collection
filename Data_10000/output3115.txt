Things got pretty busy and I\u2019ve been away on a work trip.\n\nI used to love home simulators. As a kid I played F/A-18 Interceptor and Flight Simulator 2 on the Amiga and various other sims. I find it incredible how far home sims have come particularly when it comes to graphics, frame rate etc. Some are now pretty close to photo realistic, which is what I could only dream of as a kid. Now that I\u2019m a professional pilot I very rarely use sims for fun as I get my flying fix from the real thing. When I do use simulators they are the professional full motion sims and we are doing our 6 monthly training and testing, ie it\u2019s work.\n\nAlthough many home sims now look absolutely fantastic, they are invariably not quite perfect in how they replicate the real aircraft. The feel and handling is always off to some extent, systems are generally only simulated to a superficial level and the environment is totally different (seating position, field of view, control forces etc) - meaning that despite practicing on a home sim, the real aircraft would not feel that familiar. Even professional sims, which are made with reference to all the manufacturer\u2019s performance and engineering data are still never quite perfect when it comes to handling.\n\nWhere sims are useful is practicing procedures, checklists, flight management etc. Some of the youtube videos are a reasonable representation of certain procedures but you would still need to do it in a professional sim or the real aircraft to become fully familiar with how switches move and how to do things with real-world distractions and problems.\n\nIn the real world as an airline pilot there is a lot of setup and monitoring to do. The busy parts of the flight are from getting on board to top of climb, and from top of descent to parking brake set. The cruise is generally less busy and dynamic but there are still constant tasks to carry out: monitoring systems, radio, navigation, commanding the autopilot, and thinking several moves ahead (what if we had an emergency now - how would we handle it, where could we divert to, what is the weather/notam status of these diversions, calculate the landing performance for the runway in use etc). Obviously, short haul flights have much less quiet time in the cruise compared to long haul flights. A major challenge is being able to respond an emergency instantaneously and perform to your absolute best at times when you\u2019re not expecting it, you\u2019re tired, fatigued etc. ie to perform at your best when you\u2019re feeling at your worst.\n\nWhat a lot of people don\u2019t realise (especially tech bros who tell us flying will be automated in 5 years) is that the job of a professional pilot is not really about physically flying the aircraft and having decent hand flying skills - that should pretty much go without saying. The job is really about strategy and decision making - how to achieve the mission, safely and efficiently despite all the obstacles (environmental, technical, human) that get in your way. That comes from good judgement and experience and there is no automation that can do that now or in the foreseeable future. Autopilots only do what they are told - someone still needs to decide and tell them what to do.\n\nI hardly ever find it boring. I love flying and still get a buzz from it. Sometimes the ultra long haul flights can be a bit if a struggle but any hint of boredom is quickly alleviated by thinking about the amazing destination I\u2019m going to, by watching beautiful landscapes and sights go by or by thinking about what else I could be doing if I wasn\u2019t a pilot - probably earning about 1/3 the salary doing a boring office job that I hated.\n\nIf I need \u2018fun flying\u2019 now I do aerobatics in a vintage light aircraft and having spent many years as a military pilot, now doing civilised flying and going to nice places is a perfectly welcome progression.", "edited": 1673636821.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, &lt;a href=\"/u/TinyLet4277\"&gt;u/TinyLet4277&lt;/a&gt;,  sorry I didn\u2019t get back to you sooner.

Sometimes the ultra long haul flights can be a bit if a struggle but any hint of boredom is quickly alleviated by thinking about the amazing destination I\u2019m going to, by watching beautiful landscapes and sights go by or by thinking about what else I could be doing if I wasn\u2019t a pilot - probably earning about 1/3 the salary doing a boring office job that I hated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I need \u2018fun flying\u2019 now I do aerobatics in a vintage light aircraft and having spent many years as a military pilot, now doing civilised flying and going to nice places is a perfectly welcome progression.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_105543e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskUK/comments/105543e/people_who_actually_enjoy_their_jobs_what_do_you/j47nl47/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/105543e/people_who_actually_enjoy_their_jobs_what_do_you/", "name": "t1_j47nl47", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskUK", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673636428.0, "created_utc": 1673636428.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/105543e/people_who_actually_enjoy_their_jobs_what_do_you/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm1t", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Are bigger planes nicer/more fun to fly?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "flying", "link_author": "123flywithme", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j39qf6g", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Torque_Tonight", "num_comments": 57, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1051uli", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_d4wv2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I love the 787 but when I want fun flying I take the Chipmunk out and turn it upside down.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "atp", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the 787 but when I want fun flying I take the Chipmunk out and turn it upside down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1051uli", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/flying/comments/1051uli/are_bigger_planes_nicermore_fun_to_fly/j39qf6g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1051uli/are_bigger_planes_nicermore_fun_to_fly/", "name": "t1_j39qf6g", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/flying", "author_flair_text": "ATP CH-47, 737, 777, 787", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673051192.0, "created_utc": 1673051192.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1051uli/are_bigger_planes_nicermore_fun_to_fly/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2t4s3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "People who actually enjoy their jobs - what do you do and how did you get into it?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskUK", "link_author": "gloomsbury", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j39kb2a", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Torque_Tonight", "num_comments": 160, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j39ju16", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_d4wv2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just to steady the nerves!
