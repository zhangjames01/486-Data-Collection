Barnes and Murray are better but smaller guys so I think in certain matchups situationally Metu has a role.  E.g. against the Wolves with the supersized Gobert/Kat combo I could see Metu getting some run (not as a starter obviously) to help absorb/counter some of that size.  Lyles is really the only other guy on the roster in that mold and I think the Kings would like somebody who is situationally useful and with some upside rather than a guy who is buried behind a lot of other players.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_y31os2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/kings/comments/y31os2/ham_according_to_a_league_source_the_sacramento/is77sp7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/y31os2/ham_according_to_a_league_source_the_sacramento/", "name": "t1_is77sp7", "author_flair_template_id": "61b7134c-7d1b-11e3-a90a-22000a0b8292", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/kings", "author_flair_text": "Kings", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1665692253.0, "created_utc": 1665692253.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://twitter.com/James_HamNBA/status/1580580981358018561?t=NZu3yGrcpHTEcKnorkySbQ&amp;s=19"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rqrs", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[Ham] According to a league source, the Sacramento Kings have waived Quinn Cook and Kent Bazemore.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "kings", "link_author": "Ps3FifaCfc95", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "is76qde", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "1000facedhero", "num_comments": 71, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_is672vg", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_91nan", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't disagree that much on his quality although I think it more has to do with him being one of the few guys who can play PF in 2 big lineups.

Why should people listen to you?  You&amp;#39;ve got opinions sure but opinions are like assholes.  This brand of activism comes off as petulant, self centered and egotistical.  I&amp;#39;m all for activism but it has to have a real strategy, involve actual coalition building, legitimacy and public support.  What I see is a bunch of self important cranks doing publicity stunts with no real strategy or aim.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_xtr58q", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Omaha/comments/xtr58q/we_gathered_we_spoke_we_are_free/iqumcau/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/xtr58q/we_gathered_we_spoke_we_are_free/", "name": "t1_iqumcau", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Omaha", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1664774720.0, "created_utc": 1664774720.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/xtr58q"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qk68", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I'm playing a two disc tournament soon.
