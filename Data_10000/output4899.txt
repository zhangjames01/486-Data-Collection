That aside, vanilla Ryan only has 1 useful job endgame which is Druid even then he only has 3 good skills those being, 1: Freezing Attack, 2: Bloody Funeral (nerfed in sV, can only target 1 monster) and 3: Twin Buster which is good but cant be used against some enemies as it's a lot of hits and takes too much time.

The reason that you still wanna team up with people even despite being able to solo is because it is safer in a team, takes less time and of course it is more fun to do so, but no character in Grand Chase should EVER be reliant on other people to be able to run through dungeons because you run into a problem where you want to farm \"X\" event dungeon but you rely on other people and they may just ditch you and you're alone as a support character who nobody wants.

Hellion is arguably the best character for regular dungeoneering and can still be useful for most bosses.\n\n&gt; Her skills are okay. YAWP! and iron swan are the best by far, everything else is mediocre or bad compared to similar skills.\n\nUhhh no? What makes Hellion one of the best is the combination of skills. You put in Wicked Hack + If It Bleeds + Iron Swan and suddenly you can hit all rows with a character that has above average damage. Breakthrough is also good situationally because it can be used from rank 4 while dealing damage, more for torchless runs though.\n\n&gt; While YAWP! is great when you're fighting things that aren't immediately threatening or when you're recovering the damage debuff is a really big deal when you need the hellion to do her job which is dealing damage.\n\nAlso no. Hellion can do damage yes, but front line double stun is unvaluable because you're taking 2 enemies action at the cost of 1. This is the main reason why I'd say she's the best frontline for regular dungeons because with a frontline double stun you can EASILY stall against most enemies. The damage debuff is not a big deal until it stacks twice, even then she's still dealing similar damage to most backliners and can finish enemies off, which is generally what you're gonna be doing cuz you already took 2 enemies out of the game for 2 rounds (a.k.a 4 actions).\n\n&gt; The hellion also lacks a stun chance trinket meaning you either have to run two stun trinkets or risk a 10% chance for 95% stun resist enemies to resist your stun.\n\nHer stun scales off higher than regular stuns starting off with 125% as opposed to 100% and ending at 164% as opposed to 140% so, once again no, you don't need a double stun with her as 1 Stun Amulet puts her at 184% which is enough to stun most enemies once and twice at a decent rate. You can consider this a bonus as you can run speed or damage trinkets while maintaining a good stun chance... against 2 targets. \n\n&gt; Iron swan is excellent when you want to deal damage to rank 4 and it does literally nothing the rest of the time.\n\nAlmost every single class in this game runs a fourth ability that does nothing most of the time so... even then, eliminating rank 3 and 4 is your priority against most regular enemy compositions so your Iron Swan usage tends to be pretty high at the end of the dungeon cuz you most likely used it once or twice per battle. Think about it.\n\n\n&gt; Most characters you'd run in the front rank have a single ability that targets 3 ranks on top of better supporting abilities than the Hellion.\n\nLet's think. MAA, HM and Flagy are the ones that come to mind:\n\n* One is Man-At-Arms who can hit up to rank 3 with Pound yes but can't hit rank 4, nor double stun and needs 2 stun trinkets if you want to stun something more than once.\n\n* Another one is Houndmaster who has low damage, needs to be in position 2 if in frontline and can't double stun.\n\n* Flagellant if you have DLC who can't stun at all so...\n\nThat's it? No other frontliner can hit rank 1, 2 and 3 with a single ability. As you can see, it seems Hellion isn't straight up outclassed by any of them as you're always missing out on something, be it damage or utility.\n\n\n&gt; She has no ability to buff her protection, so she's much more likely to die to crits or multiple attacks in a row.\n\nHellion max's out at 46 health. Bounty Hunter at 45, Abomination at 46, Houndmaster at 37, Highwayman at 43 and Flagellant at 38. So as you can see, she actually isn't as squishy and you know all those I mentioned also have no protection buffs on their own, meaning they can all die from multiple attacks or crits in a row, funny thing eh? Unless you know... double stun the frontline for 2 turns avoiding all those crits and multiple attacks.\n\n\n&gt; Revel can be really good if you still have a camp left at the end of the dungeon or if you want to spend 1000g on medicinal herbs.\n\nYou pretty much explained why Revel isn't bad as it can be situationally useful at the end of the dungeon or at an attempt to remove the maximum amount of stress you can before leaving a dungeon. A safety net as some you say.\n\n\n&gt; Battle Trance and Sharpen Spear are decent but they're both inconsistent and aren't very efficient.\n\nBattle Trance is a considerably good camping skill as it puts her in top notch shape for boss battles, it's pretty much a necessity if you're running Darkest Dungeon 3 as you can't afford to miss... not gonna be super specific cuz spoilers maybe. It can also be good for regular dungeons, specially champion, where you tend to avoid battles and tackle the few battles you take strategically and carefully.\n\nSharpen Spear is kinda bad yeah.\n\n\n&gt; Her class trinkets are terrible, I don't think I've ever used any of them.\n\nShe doesn't have any extremely endgame trinkets, just like most characters honestly. I do think Heaven's Hairpin is good on its own and picking up a Hell's Hairpin early on can save runs as the accuracy bonus is huge.\n\nShould look at Flagellant specific trinkets lol.\n\n\n&gt; [...] but I'd rather just run another character who has better abilities than her and doesn't cost me gold to use.\n\nWho? No other character in the game can frontline double stun and hit all 4 rows with above average damage, usually being able to almost one shot backliners.

I also recommend checking [this thread](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/ddd-gaiges-skills-for-you/1005751) which explains all her skills.\n\n\n&gt; Gear\n\nAs far as gear goes, Gaige can use a lot of things, but for newer players it's best to start out with her best, yet not super hard to farm gear:\n\n* Fibber (ricochet). This is by far her best gun and will carry you even up to 10 levels, but it is a 1/3 chance to get it as final reward from Mal's quest from Eridium Blight so it can be a pain to farm cuz you're gonna need to read-only or dashboard or close and open the game, basically keep preventing the game to save till you get what you want.\n\n* Ravager. Those are torgue shotguns that cost 4 ammo per shot, they are extremely strong with gaige as the bullets have a little AoE (or splash) so even \"missing\" you still hit enemies and do close to full damage. You can easily get one of those by doing the Torgue DLC, just save&amp;quit near a shop till you see a purple one.\n\n* Slagga. As the name implies, this is one of the best slagging guns in the game and it's really good for Gaige as it has big magazine, decent slag chance and good fire rate so you just aim at the ground and shoot it then notice everything around you is slagged. You can get it from the Hodunks after doing the Clan Wars questlines and siding with the Zafords.\n\n* Any good launcher. If you don't wanna farm, you can easily survive with a Bandit launcher for second winds, E-Tech launchers are also good due to their insanely large radius.\n\n* Rubi/Grog Nozzle. If you're having trouble in Liar's Berg I doubt you can get to the Grog so you might as well grab a Rubi from Normal/TVHM, keep in mind that ALL damage you do while holding the gun heals you so the gun itself doesn't need to be good. You can get Rubi from Mordecai's quest called Rakkaholics Anonymous and turning in to Moxxi.\n\n* Class Mods. You want any class mod that boosts \"Cooking up Trouble\" mainly, be on the lookout for those.\n\n* Shields. I like to use a Bee shield while I'm below 100 stacks then after that I switch to the tankiest shield I have such as an Adaptive Shield or Turtle Shield. You can also save a Roid Shield to give to Deathtrap right before you summon him as he gets the melee bonus. Bee shield drops from Hunter Hellquist in Arid Nexus - Boneyard after doing the quest \"This Just In!\".\n\n* Grenades. Singularities for stunning and grouping enemies, tranfusions are good for health and the Fastball is a good way to get rid of a target when you can barely shoot straight anymore. Fastball drops from Boll in Three Horns Divine after doing the \"In Memorial\" quest from Lilith.\n\n* Relics. You can go with corrosive/fire/shock damage depending on the situation, cooldown rate is also good as well as max health. A quest in Overlook called \"Arms Dealing\" gives you a guaranteed max health relic. If you're up to the task, you can do the Lynchwood quests and get yourself a Sheriff's badge and Deputy Badge, they respectively make your pistols and shotguns better.\n\n&gt; Playstyle\n\nGet your slag gun, shoot the ground a lot till at least 1 target is slagged, swap to your hurty gun, shoot the enemy, rinse and repeat. If you suddenly get to low health, summon Deathtrap he will most of the time instantly use Buck Up on you so you get your shield back then hide, swap to a gun that's full and get your Cooking Up Trouble health regen going or if the situation is pretty bad, you can manually reload to active Discord and get like to full health in seconds.\n\nEither way be aware that UVHM is not a place to be jumping around in the middle of 20 enemies and expecting to survive, be smart be strategic, try to match elements as they're a huge damage boosts (unless you're using ravagers of course) and you'll get used to it eventually.\n\nThat's all for now I think.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UVHM is not that hard once you get used to it, in fact to veteran players it generally is when the difficulty actually starts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since Normal/TVHM are far easier and generally provide no trouble at all when you grasp the game mechanics, you can do pretty much anything and get away with it, then you get to UVHM and go through what you&amp;#39;re going rn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of Thumb for UVHM is: Slag Everything, try to crit everything and focus on an enemy at a time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First of all, the skill tree&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Gaige players, UVHM tends to be the first wall as you can&amp;#39;t faceroll it anymore, so my suggestion is to go a lot more tankier trying to abuse the fact that you have &amp;quot;aimbot&amp;quot; with Close Enough and all the damage in the world with Anarchy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for newer players I suggest something around this: &lt;a href=\"http://bl2skills.com/mechromancer.html#553150100051000000000000415140131040\"&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt;.

You can get Rubi from Mordecai&amp;#39;s quest called Rakkaholics Anonymous and turning in to Moxxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Class Mods. You want any class mod that boosts &amp;quot;Cooking up Trouble&amp;quot; mainly, be on the lookout for those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shields. I like to use a Bee shield while I&amp;#39;m below 100 stacks then after that I switch to the tankiest shield I have such as an Adaptive Shield or Turtle Shield. You can also save a Roid Shield to give to Deathtrap right before you summon him as he gets the melee bonus. Bee shield drops from Hunter Hellquist in Arid Nexus - Boneyard after doing the quest &amp;quot;This Just In!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grenades. Singularities for stunning and grouping enemies, tranfusions are good for health and the Fastball is a good way to get rid of a target when you can barely shoot straight anymore. Fastball drops from Boll in Three Horns Divine after doing the &amp;quot;In Memorial&amp;quot; quest from Lilith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relics. You can go with corrosive/fire/shock damage depending on the situation, cooldown rate is also good as well as max health. A quest in Overlook called &amp;quot;Arms Dealing&amp;quot; gives you a guaranteed max health relic. If you&amp;#39;re up to the task, you can do the Lynchwood quests and get yourself a Sheriff&amp;#39;s badge and Deputy Badge, they respectively make your pistols and shotguns better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Playstyle&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get your slag gun, shoot the ground a lot till at least 1 target is slagged, swap to your hurty gun, shoot the enemy, rinse and repeat. If you suddenly get to low health, summon Deathtrap he will most of the time instantly use Buck Up on you so you get your shield back then hide, swap to a gun that&amp;#39;s full and get your Cooking Up Trouble health regen going or if the situation is pretty bad, you can manually reload to active Discord and get like to full health in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way be aware that UVHM is not a place to be jumping around in the middle of 20 enemies and expecting to survive, be smart be strategic, try to match elements as they&amp;#39;re a huge damage boosts (unless you&amp;#39;re using ravagers of course) and you&amp;#39;ll get used to it eventually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all for now I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_6xorya", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Borderlands2/comments/6xorya/having_massive_issue_in_uvhm/dmi00q2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/6xorya/having_massive_issue_in_uvhm/", "name": "t1_dmi00q2", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Borderlands2", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1504421316.0, "created_utc": 1504421316.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/6xorya/having_massive_issue_in_uvhm/"}}], "before": null}}
