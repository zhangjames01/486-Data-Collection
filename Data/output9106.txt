This is assuming Rui takes all 100 attempts, but in reality you're going to also hit the roll man 10-20% of the time probably (let's exclude other outcomes to keep things simple) and that's likely to be closer to 20% with someone like AD (just looked it up and it's 20.5% with him scoring at a 64% clip, so I guessed well haha). If AD finishes at 60% (let's be conservative here) that's about 24 points for those 20 possessions. So the pnr with Rui and AD should net you roughly 104 points per 100 possessions (80/20 split with miss or make outcome only) which is about the equivalent of a team shooting 34.66% from 3. That's better than our 33.9% from 3 this season, but would only be a better option for 7/30 teams in the league at this most simple level of analysis (we'd need to also look into 3pt play %, 2nd chance point comparison, tov%, and if this created open 3pt looks as well). \n\nThat said, if Rui could hit at 50% and AD at 60% (the latter is proven to be possible, I can't find data on my phone for Rui pnr, but I don't really think they run it that often for him, so that's likely why), it's a fairly decent offensive option for us. \n\nIf say AD hits it at his current 64% and Rui hits his at 52% (assuming it's an 80/20 split still), that's 108.8 points per 100 possessions, which is equivalent to shooting 3pters at 36.26%. That would mean the pnr is better than taking a 3pt shot for 15/30 teams in the league. \n\nIf the Rui and AD pnr can become that effective, Rui becomes an incredibly valuable asset given he can also be a decent 3pt shooter himself. One thing that we see in playoff basketball is that the mid-range becomes more valuable when defenses tend to play tougher and for some reason refs tend to let more physical play occur.
