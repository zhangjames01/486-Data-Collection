There are legit statistics that show this (for example, black people are given longer sentences than white people for the same exact crimes). Unconcious bias is a real thing, and the way we help counteract it is to raise awareness of it. That is what Black Lives Matter is about.\n\nTwo other points here - First, there is far more white on white crime than black on black crime, but no one seems to consider that an indictment of white people as a whole or as a community. Second, crime and violence are problems no matter who commits them, but they are bigger problems when they are commited by authority figures who rarely if ever experience consequences for those actions.\n\n&gt;Black lives matter movement is protesting more then freedie grey, they also protested people like mike brown who did assault an officer after robbing a store and this was proven by gran jury of wilson case.\n\nIncorrect. The Grand Jury was there to determine if the case should be tried at all. It did nothing to prove anything about Brown or Wilson, and the history of grand juries in decisions to prosecute police officers is decidedly biased towards officers. [See this article for more background.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/) It was also not determined either way whether or not Brown actually stole the cigarellos - [there is additional surveillance footage from the store showing him paying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maA1FUJqhew).\n\n&gt;freddie has a rap sheet as long as a phone book so he is without a question one of these thug life fools that try to resist arrest and run from cops.\n\nAll non-violent crimes, mostly drug-related. Does that paint a picture of a dangerous, violent person who deserved what he got?\n\n&gt;Your life is worthless to me if you spent most of it getting locked up and being a parasite and problem to mankind\n\nMany people in the inner city grow up without many options except to get into the drug trade. It's easy to say you would behave differently, but unless you have been there, you don't really know. And yes, people who commit crimes should be held accountable for them (though non-violent drug crimes have extremely harsh sentencing and this adds to the problem), but we need to look at the systems that put and keep people in this cycle rather than condeming people as worthless.\n\n&gt;however by law you should get medical treatment.\n\nSo you admit that there was misconduct in this case? From the police commissioner himself: [\"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\"](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-freddie-gray-protest-prepare-20150424-story.html#page=1)\n\n&gt;I think the destruction is not over and we will see more of it and not only in baltimore because the next black man to die to white cops will cause another riot. Regardless if his death was an accident or justifed depending on what happens(im not talking about freedie here).\n\nI don't necessarily disagree here, but I also think that police misconduct is a real, significant problem, as well as racially-biased targeting and sentencing, and we aren't seeing the end of those things anytime soon, either. That's not the fault of the protests or the riots, and those things are very destructive.\n\n&gt;You are a fucking idiot if you thibk white people riot nearly as much or as often as black people.\n\nGuess I am [an idiot then](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_of_civil_unrest_in_the_United_States#2010s), because I do [think that](http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/20/opinion/kohn-ferguson-protests/).\n\nRegardless of whether I am right or you are, do you really think that it is helpful or constructive to call me an idiot?", "edited": 1430159738.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Protesters that only say black lives matter when its a white that killd the black, these black lives matter protesters are no where to be found when a black kills a black.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Black Lives Matter&amp;quot; is about highlighting the fact that society treats black lives like they don&amp;#39;t matter as much as white lives.

Second, crime and violence are problems no matter who commits them, but they are bigger problems when they are commited by authority figures who rarely if ever experience consequences for those actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Black lives matter movement is protesting more then freedie grey, they also protested people like mike brown who did assault an officer after robbing a store and this was proven by gran jury of wilson case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Incorrect. The Grand Jury was there to determine if the case should be tried at all. It did nothing to prove anything about Brown or Wilson, and the history of grand juries in decisions to prosecute police officers is decidedly biased towards officers. &lt;a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/\"&gt;See this article for more background.&lt;/a&gt; It was also not determined either way whether or not Brown actually stole the cigarellos - &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maA1FUJqhew\"&gt;there is additional surveillance footage from the store showing him paying&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;freddie has a rap sheet as long as a phone book so he is without a question one of these thug life fools that try to resist arrest and run from cops.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All non-violent crimes, mostly drug-related. Does that paint a picture of a dangerous, violent person who deserved what he got?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your life is worthless to me if you spent most of it getting locked up and being a parasite and problem to mankind&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people in the inner city grow up without many options except to get into the drug trade. It&amp;#39;s easy to say you would behave differently, but unless you have been there, you don&amp;#39;t really know. And yes, people who commit crimes should be held accountable for them (though non-violent drug crimes have extremely harsh sentencing and this adds to the problem), but we need to look at the systems that put and keep people in this cycle rather than condeming people as worthless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;however by law you should get medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you admit that there was misconduct in this case? From the police commissioner himself: &lt;a href=\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-freddie-gray-protest-prepare-20150424-story.html#page=1\"&gt;&amp;quot;We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think the destruction is not over and we will see more of it and not only in baltimore because the next black man to die to white cops will cause another riot. Regardless if his death was an accident or justifed depending on what happens(im not talking about freedie here).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t necessarily disagree here, but I also think that police misconduct is a real, significant problem, as well as racially-biased targeting and sentencing, and we aren&amp;#39;t seeing the end of those things anytime soon, either. That&amp;#39;s not the fault of the protests or the riots, and those things are very destructive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are a fucking idiot if you thibk white people riot nearly as much or as often as black people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guess I am &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_of_civil_unrest_in_the_United_States#2010s\"&gt;an idiot then&lt;/a&gt;, because I do &lt;a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/20/opinion/kohn-ferguson-protests/\"&gt;think that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether I am right or you are, do you really think that it is helpful or constructive to call me an idiot?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_33xyhx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/baltimore/comments/33xyhx/heres_what_i_saw_at_the_freddy_gray_protests_as_a/cqqhpp8/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/33xyhx/heres_what_i_saw_at_the_freddy_gray_protests_as_a/", "name": "t1_cqqhpp8", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/baltimore", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1430159070.0, "created_utc": 1430159070.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/33xyhx/heres_what_i_saw_at_the_freddy_gray_protests_as_a/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qipq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Here's what I saw at the Freddy Gray protests, as a peaceful protester.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "baltimore", "link_author": "G3reddyFrayGoneAway", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cqqdgzy", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "etherealclarity", "num_comments": 129, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cqq8oxy", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_4lmel", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; If you people would stop protesting everything a thug is killed maybe less cities would not be looted and destroyed.\n\nI have a few questions here, that I'd genuinely like answers to.\n\nFirst - who exactly do you mean by 'you people'?

Because subjective meaning isn't not of objective value and because that meaning only has value to the subject that meaning ceases to be when the subject ceases to be. \n\nTrue. But why is objective meaning the only meaning that matters? Why is objectivity the only important thing? Hell, the concepts of subjectivity and objectivity are BOTH man-made concepts anyway. If we (or other thinking beings) weren't around, things would just *be*, there'd be no need to sort between the subjective and the objective because there'd be no one around to have conscious thought. That wouldn't be worse or better than now, it would just be how it is. But we ARE here, and we DO have feelings and thoughts that need processing, and so we create the tools to process them, including concepts like 'subjective' and 'objective'.\n\nBut even the concept of objectivity is still a man-made concept. It will die when we as a species die, unless there are other conscious beings out there who have the same concept. But while we're here, some concepts are useful to us as a species. The concept of 'meaning' is useful to us, so we use it. And the better we understand ourselves and the world around us, the better we can use it to make each other and ourselves happier.\n\n&gt;Now, life requires a hell of a lot of effort to maintain the self that holds that meaning. It requires less effort to NOT do that. Indeed, all the effort you put into not being dead is essentially wasted as we're all going to die anyway. Some get lucky and die before the end game of life, which is frankly horrible for a lot of people. So, as it requires less effort to die and death is where we're all headed anyway, why bother living?\n\nBecause human beings have a drive to live. Or more specifically, genes that are best at survival are genes that tend to survive, and therefore the living beings with those genes are the ones that tend to survive. Living is a survival instinct. It is built into our genetic code.\n\nIncidentally, who determines what time is 'wasted' or not, since the concept of waste is also man-made? Time cannot objectively be wasted on anything, because 'waste' is not an objective term.\n\nI cannot tell you that it would be better to embrace your humanity - not objectively, anyway, because who determines what is 'better' or 'worse' from that perspective? But I can tell you that most likely, you'd be happier living as a human, with the human race, caring about other humans, and deriving meaning from that.
