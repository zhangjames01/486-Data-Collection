Then cast with your new favorite resin / epoxy / whatever google says is within your budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cast piece will take to sanding the remaining layer-lines better than PLA or other common filaments so it won&amp;#39;t be nearly as frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11cpf6c", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Thatsabooklight/comments/11cpf6c/request_finding_that_trophy_upper_where_do_i_find/ja4lchl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Thatsabooklight/comments/11cpf6c/request_finding_that_trophy_upper_where_do_i_find/", "name": "t1_ja4lchl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Thatsabooklight", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677442793.0, "created_utc": 1677442793.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.imgur.com/fY35mRT.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rk5q", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Any downsides to using .3mf files for CAD to Slicer?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "3Dprinting", "link_author": "AggressiveTapping", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ja3ind2", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "TheShandyMan", "num_comments": 8, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ja3dgid", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_h61el", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; (PrusaSlicer offers native support - not all slicers do)\n\nOh that's nice to find out.
