I&amp;#39;d chase him around in the courtyard if he got near me or I&amp;#39;d shove him away. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to like him for years. I starting getting obsessive around 5th grade. I would follow him after school and get information about him from his buddies. I learned his likes and dislikes, about his family, what his favorite colors were, and so on. I also started sending him love letters and poems daily, never giving them to him personally. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of 5th grade I guess he had enough of me and sent one of his friends over with a large envelope filled with all the letters and poems I had ever written to him all torn to shreds with a message saying that it wasn&amp;#39;t gonna work out and to try again later. I was still very much in love with him after that but life goes on. I still see him every few years at family gatherings or barbecues, though, &amp;#39;cause he&amp;#39;s the nephew of my grandparent&amp;#39;s friends. It&amp;#39;s very awkward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I was Helga from Hey Arnold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_jls1g", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/jls1g/stupidest_thing_youve_done_to_get_the_attention/c2dbgzf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jls1g/stupidest_thing_youve_done_to_get_the_attention/", "name": "t1_c2dbgzf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1313648243.0, "created_utc": 1313648243.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jls1g/stupidest_thing_youve_done_to_get_the_attention/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Questions about condoms and other stuff from a sex n00b...", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "sex", "link_author": "QAthrowaway123", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c2d35py", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "nastygal", "num_comments": 13, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_jlfkf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5ka2t", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Try [TROJAN\u00ae Ultra Ribbed ECSTASY\u2122 Lubricated Condoms](http://www.trojancondoms.com/Product/ultra-ribbed-ecstasy-lubricated-condoms.aspx).
