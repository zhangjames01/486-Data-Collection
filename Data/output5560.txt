advice is for the Stealth Type A.\n\nIn early sectors (combat):\n\n-First, put your Dual Lasers in the first weapon slot, so if your weapon system takes damage against a 1 shield ship, you wont just be firing your Mini Beam into a shield.\n\n-Aim Dual Lasers at weapons if the enemy doesn't have a combat or beam drone; otherwise aim at drone control.\n\n-Some enemy weapons will fire before your Dual Lasers have charged, but you can fire your weapons before their shot will hit your hull.\n\n-Fire your laser and immediately cloak after, to prevent your weapon from disrupting your cloak.\n\n-Ideally, your weapon breaks their shield barrier and deals 1 damage to their weapons; while shields are down, fire your Mini Beam across weapons and shields if possible, otherwise across weapons and drones if they are a threat, or if they only have 1 weapon, across shields to end the fight faster.\n\n-Worst case scenario: you miss both laser shots. But, since you're cloaked, it's likely that your dual lasers will be ready before their weapons are, so you can get a second volley in and hopefully bring down their weapons.\n\nOther tips:\n\n-Shields are 125 scrap, but you can sell your Titanium System Casing augment, so in reality you only need 85 scrap.\n\n-Long Range Scanners is a godsend.
