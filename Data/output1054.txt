Here's how:\n\nLet's say the fridge is running and the inside is already cold when you put a warm object in.  This object warms the air in the fridge which is then blown across the evaporator with cold (low pressure, often liquid) coolant in it.  The air heats up the coolant, which turns to gas.  The air gives away a ton of heat making the coolant turn to gas and is now nice and cold itself.\n\nThe \"warm\" gaseous coolant vapor (still low pressure) is compressed in the compressor, turning it into hot gaseous coolant (high pressure).  This coolant runs through a condensor, which is essentially the opposite an evaporator.  The coolant gives off its heat to the outside air, and turns back into a liquid. Again, this removes a lot of heat. Finally, the coolant runs through the valve which expands the liquid coolant into a liquid and/or gas, making it cold again.  Then the cycle repeats.\n\nI hope that gives you a better idea of how the air gets so cold to cool your food, and that I wasn't too wordy explaining it all.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but the real question is: &amp;quot;How do you make the air cooler than the objects?&amp;quot;  At first, it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense.
