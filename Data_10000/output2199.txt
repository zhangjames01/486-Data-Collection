Eventually it will list which muscle groups likely have trigger points. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Click on a muscle group and in red it will specify areas that are effected. The black X \u2018s are where you may have a trigger point. Feel around those spots for muscle knots or even just points of soreness. If you can reach, apply pressure (although be very careful when you get to the front and sides of the neck). Start with 5-10 seconds on and 5 seconds off. Repeat. See if you get relief. Or, once you know the muscle group, just google how to release trigger points in that area. There are a lot of videos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if this helps at all, look into dry needling, osteopathic manipulation therapy, or manual myofascial trigger point release practitioners for longer term relief.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11qyuya", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TMJ/comments/11qyuya/anyone_else_get_horrible_neck_and_like_under/jc6sqfy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TMJ/comments/11qyuya/anyone_else_get_horrible_neck_and_like_under/", "name": "t1_jc6sqfy", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TMJ", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678801625.0, "created_utc": 1678801625.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TMJ/comments/11qyuya/anyone_else_get_horrible_neck_and_like_under/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rw7o", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "At what point do you call the vet back?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "puppy101", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jc5jhyp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "transdermalcelebrity", "num_comments": 11, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11qr9rg", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6f4ak", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It takes a while.
