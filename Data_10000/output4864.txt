My friend has always grown up with a family atmosphere that blames him for the problems that the household faces each day, and they label him as the 'black sheep' of the family, when in actuality he simply has made some mistakes in the past, and learned from them.  Every day in the summer of 2012 I would travel to his house and play a few rounds of ping-pong with him in his garage, and after every 12+ rounds of the hobby, we would sit down in the garage - just us - and just talk about anything.  Usually the talks revolved around how his family treats him and how they mentally try to break him down.  The entire summer I would listen and give my advice, and offer every single time that if he needed help to just knock on my window (we lived close together) if he ever needed anything.  \n\nThere was a night that actually happened.  I was asleep in my bedroom and heard a knocking on my window. I shot out of bed originally thinking it was a burglar but saw his crying face on the other side. I headed outside and hugged him and he informed me that his parents had told him he exhibited the same tendencies a serial killer has.  What kind of parent would tell their son that?  And knowing him on his deepest levels, I know that he wouldn't be joking about that kind of information.  We talked outside at 4 in the morning, the early cold Fall weather, and just letting him cry on my shoulder, me holding him throughout it all.  I had no advice for him that night.
