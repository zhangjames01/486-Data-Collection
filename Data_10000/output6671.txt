Seems like there is some kind of ground zero for all these conspiracies (Bill Gates foundation is trafficking kids, Hillary sacrifices babies, the rich are harvesting adrenochrome, 5G causing Covid, covid is a hoax meant to distract from child trafficking, etc.) or some group is intentionally finding these separate communities and cross-pollinating to bring everyone under the same tinfoil umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s extra bizarre is, don&amp;#39;t these people know sex trafficking has been around for, like, forever? And we have federal and international and local police forces involved in saving these victims? And there are open public records of traffickers and CP producers being sent to prison? And the wealthy and influential can cover up whatever crime they want, including sex abuse, and that&amp;#39;s been the case, once again, FOREVER?
