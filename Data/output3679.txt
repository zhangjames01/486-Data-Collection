You can play a major-focused build, a minor-focused build, something called Casino Starlight (never reclaim, just gain power cards and play them) ... you can google a bunch of different potential openings. You can go 3 card plays T1 to get the three moon innate (useful vs. Prussia / Sweden) if you want, you can rush the \"2 damage\" growth option. The fun of Starlight is that it's totally up to you.\n\nThe build that I personally prefer is to go majors immediately and craft the rest of the build around what you drew.\n\nTurn 1: Add a presence from the first option unlocking +1 card / move a presence. Gain a minor power (you can gain a major here, but it means forgetting *Gather the Scattered Light*, which is useful if you don't have the slack to open the reclaim option). Move your presence so that you can make a sacred site that can cover both lands that will be ravaging on T2. Gain one energy. Play your two minor power cards. You have no action in the fast phase but you can gain another minor and three energy and forget one of your first two minors to draw six more and gain two.\n\nYou should be looking for utility in your first set of three minors. Think about what innates might be nice to work with -- earth is a very strong defensive option, air is great if you want to play more of a control game, and plant / water are always strong. In my opinion, some sun minors are nice just in case you want to head in that direction upon seeing majors.\n\nOf course, in a multiplayer game, if you see any cards like *Growth Through Sacrifice, Gift of Constancy, Elemental Boon, Sky Stretches to Shore*, etc. then take them without hesitation and immediately start spamming them on yourself and your fellow spirits. A supportive Starlight build isn't quite as good as Gift of Proliferation, but it's real strong.\n\nUse your moon innate to (hopefully) prevent a build or reposition Dahan for later use.\n\nTurn 2: Immediately gain a major. Forget *Boon of Reimagining*. Depending on your choice of major, you can start unlocking elements, go for energy, card plays, go for the reclaim option (if you don't anticipate needing anything ASAP), go for the fast power option ... there are a few power cards you should more or less always consider IMO:\n\n* *Unleash a Torrent ...*: The laser beam. The +1 energy / move a presence combined with this card is nuts. Go for sun / fire element spaces aggressively and spam this every turn for absurd single land damage, the sun innate, and the fire innate.\n* *Vigor of the Breaking Dawn*: Self-explanatory.\n* *Draw Towards a Consuming Void*: There is a way to play this twice in five turns (fast the second time). It involves unlocking the +3 energy space, using it as often as possible, and being judicious about your other card plays and growth options. Often a nice way  to cheese a win vs. high difficulty adversaries.\n* *Jungle Hungers*: Easy to threshold and cheap. Easy to get presence into jungles. Plant element is nice.\n* *Bargains of Power / Protection*: Easily thresholded for presence acceleration, nice effect. Just be mindful of your energy income.\n* *Powerstorm*: Pick your favorite ally and let them go nuts.\n* *Storm Swath*: Cheap, and covers a lot of lands at once.\n* *Land Thrashes*: Amazing vs. Habsburg or any matchup that you're losing.\n* *Indomitable Claim / Unrelenting Growth*: Go after sun elements aggressively and spam on yourself / your allies.\n* *Fire and Flood:* Expensive, but nice in combination with a cheaper major that matches its elements.\n\nHard to give specific advice past this point. Keep an eye on your need to reclaim and consider whether you'll need energy or card plays more. You can get elements immediately if you need them or energy, but (generally) not both. Remember that the bottom two tracks do give one energy a pop, which is nice.\n\nThe strength of Starlight is the ability to tech into anything you need -- so carefully consider the matchup, the board state, and think about what needs to get done and how you can actually accomplish it. For instance, against Habsburg I frequently completely ignore Ravages the first few turns and focus on preventing builds and scaling. After you eat a few blight, you can start killing towns at will and ignore their escalation. Against Prussia, you focus on explorer control.\n\nThe weakness of Starlight is that your early game is *a touch* weak as you're focusing on gaining power cards and building towards some specific state. *Peace of the Nighttime Sky* is a nice panic button, but if you delay your action too long in favor of scaling your board can get out of control. You're also pretty heavily dependent on what you draw. A few early lackluster draws of Majors can be backbreaking, as is teching in one direction and then abandoning it to focus on something else.\n\nStarlight feels wonderfully different every game.

Think about what innates might be nice to work with -- earth is a very strong defensive option, air is great if you want to play more of a control game, and plant / water are always strong. In my opinion, some sun minors are nice just in case you want to head in that direction upon seeing majors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, in a multiplayer game, if you see any cards like &lt;em&gt;Growth Through Sacrifice, Gift of Constancy, Elemental Boon, Sky Stretches to Shore&lt;/em&gt;, etc. then take them without hesitation and immediately start spamming them on yourself and your fellow spirits. A supportive Starlight build isn&amp;#39;t quite as good as Gift of Proliferation, but it&amp;#39;s real strong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use your moon innate to (hopefully) prevent a build or reposition Dahan for later use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Turn 2: Immediately gain a major. Forget &lt;em&gt;Boon of Reimagining&lt;/em&gt;. Depending on your choice of major, you can start unlocking elements, go for energy, card plays, go for the reclaim option (if you don&amp;#39;t anticipate needing anything ASAP), go for the fast power option ... there are a few power cards you should more or less always consider IMO:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unleash a Torrent ...&lt;/em&gt;: The laser beam. The +1 energy / move a presence combined with this card is nuts. Go for sun / fire element spaces aggressively and spam this every turn for absurd single land damage, the sun innate, and the fire innate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vigor of the Breaking Dawn&lt;/em&gt;: Self-explanatory.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Draw Towards a Consuming Void&lt;/em&gt;: There is a way to play this twice in five turns (fast the second time). It involves unlocking the +3 energy space, using it as often as possible, and being judicious about your other card plays and growth options. Often a nice way  to cheese a win vs. high difficulty adversaries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Hungers&lt;/em&gt;: Easy to threshold and cheap. Easy to get presence into jungles. Plant element is nice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bargains of Power / Protection&lt;/em&gt;: Easily thresholded for presence acceleration, nice effect. Just be mindful of your energy income.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powerstorm&lt;/em&gt;: Pick your favorite ally and let them go nuts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Storm Swath&lt;/em&gt;: Cheap, and covers a lot of lands at once.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Land Thrashes&lt;/em&gt;: Amazing vs. Habsburg or any matchup that you&amp;#39;re losing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indomitable Claim / Unrelenting Growth&lt;/em&gt;: Go after sun elements aggressively and spam on yourself / your allies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire and Flood:&lt;/em&gt; Expensive, but nice in combination with a cheaper major that matches its elements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hard to give specific advice past this point. Keep an eye on your need to reclaim and consider whether you&amp;#39;ll need energy or card plays more. You can get elements immediately if you need them or energy, but (generally) not both. Remember that the bottom two tracks do give one energy a pop, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The strength of Starlight is the ability to tech into anything you need -- so carefully consider the matchup, the board state, and think about what needs to get done and how you can actually accomplish it. For instance, against Habsburg I frequently completely ignore Ravages the first few turns and focus on preventing builds and scaling. After you eat a few blight, you can start killing towns at will and ignore their escalation. Against Prussia, you focus on explorer control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The weakness of Starlight is that your early game is &lt;em&gt;a touch&lt;/em&gt; weak as you&amp;#39;re focusing on gaining power cards and building towards some specific state. &lt;em&gt;Peace of the Nighttime Sky&lt;/em&gt; is a nice panic button, but if you delay your action too long in favor of scaling your board can get out of control. You&amp;#39;re also pretty heavily dependent on what you draw. A few early lackluster draws of Majors can be backbreaking, as is teching in one direction and then abandoning it to focus on something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starlight feels wonderfully different every game. Most fun spirit, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_rdqn47", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/spiritisland/comments/rdqn47/name_your_top_5_solo_spirits/hopnca7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spiritisland/comments/rdqn47/name_your_top_5_solo_spirits/", "name": "t1_hopnca7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/spiritisland", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1639611921.0, "created_utc": 1639611921.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/spiritisland/comments/rdqn47/name_your_top_5_solo_spirits/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_mw8qk", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Sleeve recommendations?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "spiritisland", "link_author": "putting_stuff_off", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ho97czi", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ProfQuirrell", "num_comments": 24, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_reqd9u", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_c7ftu", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I got UltraPro sleeves and they've started to split on a number of cards -- that being said, they've been in pretty regular use for a little over a year.

As best I can determine what's going on, the section of the ACA held to be unconstitutional (the individual mandate) cannot directly injure anyone (a \"tax\" of 0% / $0 can't harm you) and that the harm described (mostly costs from state operated programs / administration) from *other* portions of the ACA are not traceable to the individual mandate.\n\n&gt;The problem with these claims, however, is that other provisions of Act, not the minimum essential coverage provision, impose these other requirements. Nothing in the text of these form provisions suggests that they would not operate without \\[the individual mandate\\].  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Majority Opinion)\n\nThe dissent (and Thomas) point out that this is disingenuous with the two previous times the law has come before the court, when it was argued that the individual mandate was a key cornerstone of the ACA and that the different moving parts all required one another to work as Congress intended. It was argued at the time in the first ACA ruling, *NFIB v. Sebelius*, that the individual mandate was necessary to prevent a financial death spiral where healthy people had no reason to purchase health insurance and would bail out of the market.\n\n&gt;At that time, the individual mandate imposed a \u201cpenalty\u201d on most Americans who refused to purchase health insurance or enroll in Medicaid, and it was widely thought that without the mandate much of the Act\u2014 and perhaps even the whole scheme\u2014would collapse.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(Dissent)\n\nThe States argued that the fact that the different sections of the ACA are linked (as discussed in *Sebelius* and held to be true for much of the legislation's history, although apparently not any more) means that their harm can be traced back to the individual mandate.\n\n&gt;There can be no question that this argument is conceptually sound. Imagine Statute ABC. Provision A imposes enforceable legal obligations on the plaintiff. Provision B imposes a legal obligation on a different party. And provision C provides that a party is not obligated to comply with provision A if provision B is held to be unconstitutional. Based on the plain text of this law, a party subject to provision A should be able to obtain relief from the enforcement of provision A if it can show that provision B is unconstitutional. To hold otherwise would be directly contrary to the statutory text. But the Court\u2019s reasoning would make such a claim impossible. The plaintiff would be thrown out of court at the outset of the case for lack of standing.\n\nAs best I can determine, the ACA is currently in a very odd legal space. The individual mandate as it currently stands is unconstitutional (as best I can tell, most of the judges actually agree on this), but since it doesn't actually cause any harm it doesn't seem possible to have standing to attack it. The other parts of the ACA have been linked to the individual mandate in previous defenses of the legislation, but (for some reason) no more.\n\n&gt;In their view, Congress decides whether the provisions it enacts are linked to one another or not, and the answer lies in the ordinary tools of statutory construction. And everything the NFIB dissenters said points to the same conclusion as a matter of the ACA\u2019s text, history, and structure. The relevant provisions were passed as a comprehensive exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause and (arguably) Taxing Clause powers. Those powers cannot justify the individual mandate. The statutory text says the individual mandate is \u201cessential\u201d to the overall scheme, 42 U. S.

I am not sure the question of severability has ever come up in a formal way, though.\n\nAlito closes his dissent in the following way:\n\n&gt;No one can fail to be impressed by the lengths to which this Court has been willing to go to defend the ACA against all threats. A penalty is a tax. The United States is a State. And 18 States who bear costly burdens under the ACA cannot even get a foot in the door to raise a constitutional challenge.
