That is, in the first movie, it&amp;#39;s never established with authority that Rage was a virus.  In fact there are clues that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a virus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, there are shots showing the monkeys being exposed to visual acts of violence in the lab.  The lab tech isn&amp;#39;t wearing PPE and tries to defend the work he&amp;#39;s doing by saying &amp;quot;In order to control rage, we must understand it&amp;quot;.  The lab is also just labeled &amp;quot;Primate Research Center&amp;quot; and not something with a word like virology.  There are &amp;quot;high risk of infection&amp;quot; signs but not the international symbol for contagions.  There are no UV or airflow protections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words &amp;quot;Rage&amp;quot; is literally &amp;quot;rage&amp;quot; as in our society is on the brink of collapse and we&amp;#39;re all just one step away from freaking the f*ck out.  It&amp;#39;s a physiological response, but not pathogenetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an assumption by the characters that it&amp;#39;s a virus or at least some sort of pathogen, and I believe Danny Boyle (who directed the first one) even acknowledged that it&amp;#39;s a pathogen in an interview, but the movie plays out with it not being so.  For example, the protagonist almost becomes &amp;quot;enraged&amp;quot; himself through just emotional triggering, not through actual infection.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This theory is wiped out in 28 Weeks Later because characters with authority clearly establish that it&amp;#39;s a virus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hated this aspect at the time as much as I hated the rest of the movie.

Not just the AirPods but from multiple vendors across different levels (from cheap to high-end).  There&amp;#39;s definitely an R&amp;amp;D return on economy of scale based on a very significant shift in numbers of people using Bluetooth with the headphone ports being removed from iPhones (and others).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a reason they branded it as a courageous design decision and that is because it was anti-user and they were saying &amp;quot;trust us, it&amp;#39;ll be fine eventually p.s. here&amp;#39;s our own version of Bluetooth headphones&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sounds like you&amp;#39;re agreeing with me here.  Apple making a longer term user experience benefit decision at the expense of specs is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; making a decision that prioritizes user experience over specs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t the only example of this... removing the floppy... longer term user experience benefit over specs.  The same goes for the optical drive, and other things Apple has removed or not included (specs) to drive the user experience forward with benefit long term.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apple can be wrong, and sometimes very much is.  Apple may make a decision that even long term doesn&amp;#39;t benefit everyone, but the decision nonetheless was to drive people to Bluetooth as a better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&amp;#39;s certainly&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;no argument&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;that removing the headphone was a decision that prioritized specs as it&amp;#39;s literally removing a spec.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11q8m5e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/technology/comments/11q8m5e/samsung_wrapped_in_controversy_over_fake_space/jc5zn87/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11q8m5e/samsung_wrapped_in_controversy_over_fake_space/", "name": "t1_jc5zn87", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/technology", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678781999.0, "created_utc": 1678781999.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-fake-space-zoom-moon-images-3295501/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Samsung wrapped in controversy over 'fake' Space Zoom moon shots", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "technology", "link_author": "miso25", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jc5cjwh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "mredofcourse", "num_comments": 174, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jc59aud", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_52h3f", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The bumper was released at the same time as the iPhone 4.
