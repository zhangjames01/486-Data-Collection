Fear is such a powerful tool, and Voldemort used it well. \n\n1) Your Hermione point: You're right, she definitely read everything she could get her hands on before Hogwarts. Which means she read all the atrocities, all the damage and destruction and deaths caused by Voldemort. As a young girl who just discovered magic is real and on some level feels that that makes the wizard/witch quiet powerful, it must have been daunting to realize that one individual can still be so cruel and wicked. And if Hermione is anything, she posses a thriving mind that can really imagine the scar such a man could leave on this world. She takes things in books literally. If it says that he was the most evil wizard Britain had ever known, I don't see her underestimating a history of dark arts book.\n\n2) Of course it's over the top. These are children's book (semi.) However, my grandmother lost her parents in the holocaust. When I started learning about it in school and went home and talked about it, every time I said Hitler's name she would react in some way (looking to the ground, grinding her teeth, dropping what she was holding, etc.) She had experienced a personal loss because of Hitler. And isn't it known that at the height of Voldemort's reign, almost every wizard in  Britain had experienced some personal loss from him? When my grandma died, my dad said he only heard her say Hitler twice in his life, and that she would break down shortly after, as though by saying the name she had invited him and all he had done straight into the room she was sitting in.\n\nIt's exaggerated, but a pretty good way to depict a feeling by actions. The fear of the name makes people skittish.

Fear is such a powerful tool, and Voldemort used it well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Your Hermione point: You&amp;#39;re right, she definitely read everything she could get her hands on before Hogwarts. Which means she read all the atrocities, all the damage and destruction and deaths caused by Voldemort. As a young girl who just discovered magic is real and on some level feels that that makes the wizard/witch quiet powerful, it must have been daunting to realize that one individual can still be so cruel and wicked. And if Hermione is anything, she posses a thriving mind that can really imagine the scar such a man could leave on this world. She takes things in books literally. If it says that he was the most evil wizard Britain had ever known, I don&amp;#39;t see her underestimating a history of dark arts book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Of course it&amp;#39;s over the top.

When I started learning about it in school and went home and talked about it, every time I said Hitler&amp;#39;s name she would react in some way (looking to the ground, grinding her teeth, dropping what she was holding, etc.) She had experienced a personal loss because of Hitler. And isn&amp;#39;t it known that at the height of Voldemort&amp;#39;s reign, almost every wizard in  Britain had experienced some personal loss from him? When my grandma died, my dad said he only heard her say Hitler twice in his life, and that she would break down shortly after, as though by saying the name she had invited him and all he had done straight into the room she was sitting in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s exaggerated, but a pretty good way to depict a feeling by actions.
