If any happened before then, I just don't recall them.  More than twenty years later, I can still remember much of the experience.\n\nAfter dinner on a school night, I just started feeling \"off\".  My head felt sort of dull and there was a strange aura in the periphery of my left eye.  I ran a hot bath (I didn't make the hop to showers for another year or so...and I still enjoy a hot bath every now and then)  and just relaxed in the water.\n\nI must have fallen asleep and been in there a while, because the next thing I remember was the sound of my mother pounding on the locked bathroom door and calling my name.  My Mom panics easily, so she thought I had drowned in the tub.  I tried to respond verbally, but it was like my tongue wouldn't respond and the left side of my face felt like it had fallen asleep.  I tried to stand out of the tub, but my left leg didn't work, so I almost collapsed.  I managed to drag myself out of the tub, wrap up in a towel, and open the door.\n\nLater on my mother would describe me as looking \"doped out\".  I remember that it took a moment for me to gather my thoughts enough to ask my mother to get me some clothes.  Slowly the world started to make sense again.  In my mind, I attributed it to just still being mostly asleep.  I managed to get a pair of shorts and a t-shirt on, despite my left leg still not really working and my vision being a bit impaired.\n\nIt was about then that the pain hit me.  I still get these headaches from time to time, but their onset is much slower and less intense now.  This first one was a very quick ascent into a plane of existence that was comprised of naught but pain.  It was all-consuming.  My mind could conceive of absolutely nothing but a piecing, searing pain.\n\nIn my young life by then, I had managed to fall out onto my back out of a tree from a height of about 8 feet.  My sister stabbed me with a kitchen knife (a flesh wound...I don't think she realized how close I was or really that she might actually kill me).  This one kid who was a genuine sociopath at my school knocked me unconscious on our school bus by smashing my head into the wall of the bus.  I got thrown off a 4-wheeler on a gravel driveway at about 20 mph.\n\nNone of those scenarios compare to the pain I was experiencing from that headache.  None of them are even close to the same sort of pain.  They are simply not analogous to whatever it was my brain was now interpreting as pain.  This was like a totally different type of sensation and it was as if my brain was now in a full panic, trying desperately to communicate to me that a whole new dimension of pain was possible and I was experiencing it **right then**.\n\nMy mother came to check on me, but all I could do was meekly say that my head hurt *really bad*.  She tried to give me Excedrin, but I couldn't even gather myself enough to take it.  After about fifteen or twenty minutes of the fabric of existence being shredded, the headache started to wane a bit.  That's when the nausea hit.\n\nI staggered back to the bathroom (a short walk, thankfully) and threw up.  Then again.  And again.  And again.  A vicious cycle started where the headache would lighten up, I'd puke, then the headache would return to full strength.  I actually was a little thankful for the puking because it was a brief respite from the pain, but eventually the straining of dry heaving was becoming its own form of pain as the muscles in my abdomen started to strain.\n\nAt this point my parents decided it would be prudent to get me to a hospital.  This was in a rural area of Mississippi, so the closest half-decent medical facility was about half an hour away in Louisiana.  We get there and I can't even walk in.  My head is still filled with pain, my eyesight is still a little hampered by a discolored aura, my left leg isn't quite functional, and I'm weak from the puking.\n\nThe doctor at this podunk medical center takes one look at me and decides I'm obviously overdosing on *something*.  In his defense, drug usage was common in our area and the statistics based on those symptoms were in his favor.  But I've never so much as smoked weed, much less taken something I might *actually* OD on, so I was pretty angry about it.  He even tried to get my mother to coax a confession out of me (\"It's okay...I won't be mad...just tell me what you took\"), but I had nothing to offer them.\n\nThey gave up and transferred me by ambulance to a regional children's hospital, about an hour and a half away.  The headache had loosened its grip by that point, the pain coming in distinct waves instead of a solid, unrelenting wall of misery.  Between the waves, I would pass out in the back of the ambulance.  Then a wave would hit, I'd wake up with a moan, heave a bit of bile (which is all I had left), and convulse a bit in pain until the wave would pass and I'd be out again.\n\nBy the time we got to the hospital, exhaustion was overriding just about everything else.  I don't remember much except almost throwing up in the CAT scan machine and a neurologist asking my mother if anyone in our family had bad migraine headaches.  Unfortunately, one of my daughters inherited them from me.  Her first happened much younger, about 5 years old, and unfortunately seemed to be as intense as the first that I can recall.  I cried in sympathy for her, because I knew what she was going through.\n\nThe neurologist back then told my Mom that my headaches would get less intense and possibly more frequent as I got older, and that's been the case on both counts.  Now the headaches start with the aura, but it's not as intense or blinding.  The pain is totally manageable with over-the-counter meds and the nausea is virtually non-existent.\n\n**tl;dr - Hemiplegic migraines suck.**", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I inherited hemiplegic migraines from my grandfather on my Mom&amp;#39;s side of the family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was fourteen when I had the first one I can remember.
