RNG should be avoided *at all costs* when there is literally nothing holding the warframe together. The changes i would make are:\n\n* Barrage now tracks targets, and strikes more accurately. Range increases the area it picks/chooses from, and power strength increases the speed the barrage fires at (effectively giving increased rate of fire).\n\nHe can now be built as a control mage with large Area Denial. While the damage would still fall of quickly at higher levels, at least you would have consistent crowd control in a target area. W is a decent ability, but I find it horribly boring. At higher levels its more likely to get me killed than save me as well.\n\n* Roll his W and E together into a single ability. His W now turns you into a \"Wave form\" with increased movement speed, which allows you to move around and push enemies. Instead of pure invulnerability, he gains 75% Damage Resistance while moving, and 90% Damage resistance while standing still. It does light DoT to enemies that are near, while doing moderate impact damage to enemies you knock around.\n\nNow both of his utility spells are together into one *decent ability* that highlights their strengths. By freeing E, we can now add not only more utility to him, but fix the glaring weaknesses in his kit.\n\n* E **UNLEASH THE KRAKEN!** Hydroid can toggle this on/off. While its on he gains 30% maximum health and shields, 50% bonus armor, as well as increased health/shield regen. His melee attacks gain bonus damage to \"Soaked\" enemies (enemies harmed by his Q/W/R).\n\nNow he can mix both melee tankyness with well positioned abilities to be *extremely effective*. He can activate it during downtime to heal up, or just before he enters the fray so he can deal massive melee damage. It also highlights the idea that hes supposed to be a sort of \"Pirate\" frame. He fights dirty by weakening you with abilities, then going in for the kill.\n\n* R now properly targets enemies, and their hitbox is determined by Ability Power. They can still only damage one enemy at a time, but they will *intelligently* target enemies. Enemies damaged/\"Soaked\" by tentacles have increased item drop chance (20%-50%).\n\nAnd this is how I would change Hyrdoid.

His W now turns you into a &amp;quot;Wave form&amp;quot; with increased movement speed, which allows you to move around and push enemies. Instead of pure invulnerability, he gains 75% Damage Resistance while moving, and 90% Damage resistance while standing still. It does light DoT to enemies that are near, while doing moderate impact damage to enemies you knock around.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now both of his utility spells are together into one &lt;em&gt;decent ability&lt;/em&gt; that highlights their strengths. By freeing E, we can now add not only more utility to him, but fix the glaring weaknesses in his kit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;E &lt;strong&gt;UNLEASH THE KRAKEN!&lt;/strong&gt; Hydroid can toggle this on/off. While its on he gains 30% maximum health and shields, 50% bonus armor, as well as increased health/shield regen. His melee attacks gain bonus damage to &amp;quot;Soaked&amp;quot; enemies (enemies harmed by his Q/W/R).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now he can mix both melee tankyness with well positioned abilities to be &lt;em&gt;extremely effective&lt;/em&gt;. He can activate it during downtime to heal up, or just before he enters the fray so he can deal massive melee damage. It also highlights the idea that hes supposed to be a sort of &amp;quot;Pirate&amp;quot; frame. He fights dirty by weakening you with abilities, then going in for the kill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;R now properly targets enemies, and their hitbox is determined by Ability Power. They can still only damage one enemy at a time, but they will &lt;em&gt;intelligently&lt;/em&gt; target enemies. Enemies damaged/&amp;quot;Soaked&amp;quot; by tentacles have increased item drop chance (20%-50%).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this is how I would change Hyrdoid. A control/warrior that excels in combining his spells and tankyness to at least keep enemies busy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3g17zj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Warframe/comments/3g17zj/how_would_you_change_hydroid/ctue7mg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3g17zj/how_would_you_change_hydroid/", "name": "t1_ctue7mg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Warframe", "author_flair_text": "Insert Ice Pun", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1438916402.0, "created_utc": 1438916402.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3g17zj/how_would_you_change_hydroid/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qio8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "To the unsubbed, unsatisfied, and unimpressed: What does Blizzard have to show tomorrow to win you over?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "wow", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cttmdep", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "kouriichi", "num_comments": 664, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3fz8nb", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_67gxw", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nerubians.\n\nI wont lie, i severely lost interest in WoW when i saw [Gnomes 2.0](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/2/25/Goblins_cataclysm.png/revision/latest?cb=20090824095613) and I only floated farther away with the addition of the worst animal at survival becoming a [playable race.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/3/30/Pandarens_playable.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120407055344)\n\nI wish we were to get a *really cool race*.
