The key differentiator between this one and other beginner rubbers is that it has an especially thick topsheet making it very durable. However, I have found that there are times where the ball slips off the rubber if I don&amp;#39;t hit correctly. As your level improves, this rubber can actually do a decent job of keeping up; it&amp;#39;s good for both beginner and intermediate levels, but then again, there are better options once you reach that point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_mje35v", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/tabletennis/comments/mje35v/is_yasaka_mark_v_any_good/gt9zlda/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/mje35v/is_yasaka_mark_v_any_good/", "name": "t1_gt9zlda", "author_flair_template_id": "f19df82a-57d9-11e3-a193-12313b0111fc", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tabletennis", "author_flair_text": "Acoustic / FH Hexer Powergrip / BH Vega Pro", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1617479684.0, "created_utc": 1617479684.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tabletennis/comments/mje35v/is_yasaka_mark_v_any_good/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfh", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "New spin rubber recommendation?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "tabletennis", "link_author": "MrRedPoll", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gsiv4qv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "GodsDelight", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_meld7h", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_9szr3", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "There are different types of \"spinny\" rubbers.
