You can use this to exploit them fighting amongst themselves to gain ground for yourself.\n\nYour first instinct will be to attack the weakest faction - this is wrong. There are a couple of reasons why.\nFirst, factions with few settlements will have more lords holed up in each one, plus in my experience they tend to have built up large militias/garrisons (this is often why they haven't been taken yet). Larger factions, on the other hand, have to divide their lords and troops among more settlements, so the chance that they have a weak underbelly somewhere is higher.\n\nSecond, if you join with stronger factions in defeating the weaker one, what you'll be left with is an even stronger faction that is more likely to declare war on you. Lords of a faction that is weak are likely to defect to another, stronger faction, making them even stronger.\nOn the other hand, if you attack the stronger faction and use the benefits of being a human player to deliver their armies crushing defeats, weaker AI factions are more likely to be able to push them back and take stuff off them. So, what you need to do is maintain a balance of power that you can exploit.\n\nKeep an eye on who is fighting who. Wait until one faction takes something off another; if you then declare war on them, you should be able to take the settlement they have just taken - instead of having like 500 defenders it will only have 50-150. Much easier.\nIf they're then a threat, pay them off for peace.\n\nThe main issue for you is you don't really have enough money at the moment, nor a good source of it - as an example, buying peace can cost anything between 1 gold or 80k gold, and normally costs me around 60k, and being able to buy peace is absolutely crucial to preventing yourself from being overwhelmed. Your first objective should be to secure a town. From looking at this picture, your best bet is probably Lageta - it's in the border between the different factions, so allows lots of opportunity to expand in different directions.\n\nOnce you have this town, buy every single workshop there, and create caravans if you can. Then, defend it AT ALL COSTS, as it will be your main source of income. Buy peace with the empire as soon as possible, then try to maintain that peace until you can build up a huge pot of gold - at least 500k if you can.\n\nAs for policies - your first one after taking the town should be Council of the Commons - this gives you influence for every notable in your fiefs, which provides the biggest amount of influence which you can then use for everything else. Then, at your discretion, pass other policies while you are unopposed - I suggest ones which expand your party size and those of high tier lords, ones which increase militia production (so you can more easily hold on to what you take), the Hunting Rights one which increases food, and maybe ones like Road Tolls if you are still struggling for money.\n\nDo missions for the notables in your town and villages so you can more easily restock your army with good troops. If any lords pass through your lands, talk to them and give them a gift of 1 gold to get Charm XP. When you have a lot of gold and charm, you can use that to start convincing lords to join you. If you do that while at war with their faction, they will normally defect with their fiefs. If you are at peace, you will still get their whole clan and all their troops, which is useful in and of itself (though be warned, if you don't capture fiefs and give them to your new clans, they may defect back, although this mechanic also seems a little bugged). If you have good relations with the lords, or they have certain traits (I'm honestly not sure which) they may defect to you straight away. Otherwise, they will ask for something and the barter screen will open. This can cost 100s of 1000s of gold, so again, you need solid income and lots in the bank.\n\nDon't be afraid to savescum this! It works partly on random chance so it's fair enough in my opinion.\n\nOnce you have a solid base, I suggest from your situation focusing on fighting the Vlandians and taking any castles between Charas, Sargot, Ortysia, and Lageta, and those cities themselves if you can - but again, this is just vague advice as it's important, specially early on, that you're opportunistic and take vulnerable targets, which will change as your campaign progresses. If the Vlandians start looking weak and another faction (perhaps the Aserai from looking at this) starts to make too many gains, switch your focus. If a faction other than your target faction declares war in you (e.g. the Battanians, or the empire, whatever), just buy them off and carry on fighting whoever you actually want to be fighting.\n\nWhile doing this, don't try to deliver the killing blow at once. Even if you keep inflicting massive defeats, early on the AI will be way stronger and way better placed to recover, so you will lose a war of attrition. Take what you can, then buy peace when you have gained more territory than you have lost *even if it's just one castle or town*. Think of it as a war against salami - you want to take it slice by slice, buying yourself peace so your town/castle militia can recover, you can go recruit more troops, etc, before war breaks out again.\n\nby following these general guidelines, I went from a shitty little lord controlling Quyaz and 2 castles who defected from a Khuzaits who controlled 2/3rds of the map at least, to the biggest faction in the game.\n\nGood luck.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on who near you is fighting who. \nYour western castle is in a perfect location in some ways - you have 5 different factions nearby who will fight each other at some point. You can use this to exploit them fighting amongst themselves to gain ground for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your first instinct will be to attack the weakest faction - this is wrong. There are a couple of reasons why.\nFirst, factions with few settlements will have more lords holed up in each one, plus in my experience they tend to have built up large militias/garrisons (this is often why they haven&amp;#39;t been taken yet). Larger factions, on the other hand, have to divide their lords and troops among more settlements, so the chance that they have a weak underbelly somewhere is higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, if you join with stronger factions in defeating the weaker one, what you&amp;#39;ll be left with is an even stronger faction that is more likely to declare war on you. Lords of a faction that is weak are likely to defect to another, stronger faction, making them even stronger.\nOn the other hand, if you attack the stronger faction and use the benefits of being a human player to deliver their armies crushing defeats, weaker AI factions are more likely to be able to push them back and take stuff off them. So, what you need to do is maintain a balance of power that you can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on who is fighting who. Wait until one faction takes something off another; if you then declare war on them, you should be able to take the settlement they have just taken - instead of having like 500 defenders it will only have 50-150. Much easier.\nIf they&amp;#39;re then a threat, pay them off for peace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main issue for you is you don&amp;#39;t really have enough money at the moment, nor a good source of it - as an example, buying peace can cost anything between 1 gold or 80k gold, and normally costs me around 60k, and being able to buy peace is absolutely crucial to preventing yourself from being overwhelmed. Your first objective should be to secure a town. From looking at this picture, your best bet is probably Lageta - it&amp;#39;s in the border between the different factions, so allows lots of opportunity to expand in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have this town, buy every single workshop there, and create caravans if you can. Then, defend it AT ALL COSTS, as it will be your main source of income. Buy peace with the empire as soon as possible, then try to maintain that peace until you can build up a huge pot of gold - at least 500k if you can.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for policies - your first one after taking the town should be Council of the Commons - this gives you influence for every notable in your fiefs, which provides the biggest amount of influence which you can then use for everything else.
