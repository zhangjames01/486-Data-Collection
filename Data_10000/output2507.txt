Unless you *do* want to play classical/flamenco.\n\nOriginal commenter was just saying nylon strings are a good option generally as a *first* guitar to learn on. I agree, if a nylon string is what you have on hand.\n\nBut the one you have is almost certainly fine for you. Yes steel strings are harder on the fingers than nylons, but with a decent setup and as long as you don't let your strings get too old and crusty, and \"take it easy\" for the first couple of months or so (ie don't practice for hours and hours a day, and take a break if your fingertips get too sore or shredded), you'll be fine.\n\nHonestly the one you have looks just about perfect for a beginner looking to play any modern/western guitar music. The set up even looks good, or at least the action (height of strings off the fretboard) looks good from what I can see. Take it for a set-up if you like and can afford it, sure, but maybe just restring it first (I'd say go for \"elevens\" - guitar shop employees will know what you're talking about, brand doesn't matter much). If it feels and sounds ok then you're probably good to go.\n\nJust keep your strings in as good a condition as you can: don't play with greasy/dirty fingers, and wipe the strings down after each session, and a set should last a good few months. You'll know they need changing when they sound horribly dull or get crusty and overly painful to play on.\n\nThat said though, be rational about your experience; expect it to be challenging, and for your fingertips to be somewhat sore for the first couple of months, but if it's impossible to get some notes \"clean\" (without any buzzing/rattling) or is 'unreasonably' strenuous or uncomfortable to do so, definitely get it checked out for a professional setup.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude0a", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t go to a nylon from a steel string.

I agree, if a nylon string is what you have on hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the one you have is almost certainly fine for you. Yes steel strings are harder on the fingers than nylons, but with a decent setup and as long as you don&amp;#39;t let your strings get too old and crusty, and &amp;quot;take it easy&amp;quot; for the first couple of months or so (ie don&amp;#39;t practice for hours and hours a day, and take a break if your fingertips get too sore or shredded), you&amp;#39;ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly the one you have looks just about perfect for a beginner looking to play any modern/western guitar music. The set up even looks good, or at least the action (height of strings off the fretboard) looks good from what I can see.
