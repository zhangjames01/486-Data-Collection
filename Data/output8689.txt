The scene you saw at the start of the ride in Shanghai with the jailed skeleton pirates whistling for the skeleton dog holding the keys? You'll get to see it while the pirates and dog were alive. It gave me shivers to see them dead in Shanghai! And right after that, Jack came to life and the crazy part of the ride started. I felt like they'd \"killed\" our old ride and it was brutal. And so awesome.\n\nAlso, since it sounds like you've been to WDW in Florida, look up while you're in Tomorrowland to see our old Peoplemover track. They still run in Florida, but were scrapped in the 90's at Disneyland.

You&amp;#39;ll get to see it while the pirates and dog were alive. It gave me shivers to see them dead in Shanghai! And right after that, Jack came to life and the crazy part of the ride started.

Every time I get a critique, it is a bonus, not a requirement. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t seem to have the patience to wait until the sketch is correct before I want to rush off and get to the paint. So my perspective is constantly a bit screwy. Also, sketching from life, rather than sketching a photo is new to me and so the screwiness is further screwed.
