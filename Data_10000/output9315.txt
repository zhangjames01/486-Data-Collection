Creating art has &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; micro and macro decisions being made in real time that make you responsible for the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I go into a sandwich shop regardless of if I have 1 parameter (type of bread) or 20 parameters (pickles, mustard, lettuce, etc.) someone behind the counter is still making my sandwich for me. That&amp;#39;s totally different than if I jumped behind the counter halfway and put all the toppings on myself. Then the parameters change from &amp;quot;pickles&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;which pickles specifically do I want&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;how many pickles exactly&amp;quot; &amp;quot;where do the pickles go?&amp;quot; and you may or may not care about those parameters consciously but you are making those decisions in the act of putting pickles on your sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m basically just saying you should be doing some significant amount of creative decision making in the creation process itself to be regarded as the creator of something.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10kw1sc", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/aiwars/comments/10kw1sc/are_you_creating_the_art_or_is_the_computer/j5uvokk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/10kw1sc/are_you_creating_the_art_or_is_the_computer/", "name": "t1_j5uvokk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/aiwars", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1674673212.0, "created_utc": 1674673212.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "/r/Human_Artists_Info/comments/10kw1n2/are_you_creating_the_art_or_is_the_computer/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_7lv9o6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Are you creating the Art or is the computer creating it?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "aiwars", "link_author": "ryan_knight_art", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5ugwek", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TurningItIntoASnake", "num_comments": 69, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j5t51gh", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_7bzf5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;If I write a blender addon that creates a random  landscape  when the user presses a button is that the computer creating, me creating ,or the user creating the landscape?
