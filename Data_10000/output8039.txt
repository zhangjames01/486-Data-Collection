Now not only is the whole keystone of the rotation (F1 cooldown) gone, there&amp;#39;s much less incentive to even swap into scepter. Is the group might gain of scepter always worth the personal DPS loss of non camping axe? maybe, depending on how grouped people are and if you are already at might cap, so it seems like the &amp;quot;easier&amp;quot; rotation (just camp axe) is at least much closer to correct that than the... rotation that actually involves... rotating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thats a big fun/skill issue I havent seen brought up as much - that the reduction of &amp;quot;stuff to do while in scepter and not sceptering&amp;quot; leads to a feeds bad (AA scepter) or feels boring (camp axe) choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Making, for example, F1-1 cost no pages and deal less condi than axe AA but more DPS on a condi build than scepter AA solves this problem. It would be correct to spam F1-1 in between scepter F2s (maybe above or below torch 5), and incorrect to spam it over axe AAs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This could still lead to some decisions - do you go back to swapping scepter only when F1-5 is off CD? or do you start always swapping to get more scepter 2 filling with F1-1 and use F1-5 off CD regardless of weapon?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I think the key to cQFB having a meaningful and fun rotation needs two things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;visible cooldown on major tome use (CD of F1-5 visible out of tome, everyone has suggested this)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;something non-scepter to do while in scepter (your 4.2 could address this)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zdalii", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Guildwars2/comments/zdalii/how_tome_of_justice_could_regain_a_proper_rotation/iz1ntak/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zdalii/how_tome_of_justice_could_regain_a_proper_rotation/", "name": "t1_iz1ntak", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Guildwars2", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1670272109.0, "created_utc": 1670272109.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/zdalii/how_tome_of_justice_could_regain_a_proper_rotation/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_39cuc", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Can't declare war on Galactic Emperor, was initially a vassal", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Stellaris", "link_author": "tasalien", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iggydtb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "tasalien", "num_comments": 2, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iggxnbi", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_51eno", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't think so - I dont see it under \"active effects\" of anywhere under resolutions anyway.\n\nGiven that the war message I'm getting is specific to \"the ruler of the Galactic Imperium\" I'm guessing I probably could declare war on anyone else, but the \"intent\" is to only declare war on the Emperor via the espionage method.\n\nCurrently waiting to re-run espionage after kicking everyone out of the rebel federation, might try releasing all subjects after that too... running out of ideas", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think so - I dont see it under &amp;quot;active effects&amp;quot;

It definitely helps that I find the content enjoyable, but now that I can clear it somewhat comfortably (kept running to get my tormented weapon) I think it is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rough math: I think a comfortable (non-speedrun) clear is about 2 hours for all areas + Mallyx.  This gives an average of 3.5 gemstones each (1-4 per area, +1 per Mallyx).  This takes about 4 runs, 8 hours, for one Armbrace (15 gemstones each).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at common sellers/buyers, and Armbrace is 38-40e - so that&amp;#39;s (about) 5e per hour, PLUS all of your drops - plenty of loot to salvage here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously there&amp;#39;s a lot of variability here and I&amp;#39;m making some estimates, any wipe is going to set you back, but with 5e/hour+ mats/golds I think it&amp;#39;s a good method that&amp;#39;s a lot more interesting than traditional farming.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_isfhiv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/GuildWars/comments/isfhiv/any_updated_money_makers/g5b4vkm/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/isfhiv/any_updated_money_makers/", "name": "t1_g5b4vkm", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/GuildWars", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1600131604.0, "created_utc": 1600131604.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/isfhiv/any_updated_money_makers/"}}], "before": null}}
