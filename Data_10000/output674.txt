I won&amp;#39;t say too much more about it because I don&amp;#39;t want to spoil it but it&amp;#39;s a powerful film that tackles racism and PTSD in a time when they weren&amp;#39;t dealt with nearly as much. It also has my favorite line from a film ever, &amp;quot;if you die, I&amp;#39;ll kill you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1183921/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\"&gt;The Vicious Kind&lt;/a&gt; is a newer independent film from 2009 that I absolutely loved. Excellent performances from JK Simmons, Brittany Snow, and especially Adam Scott who does an amazing job as a character named Caleb who comes home to visit his father and brother during Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: meant to say The Steel Helmet was Fuller&amp;#39;s first war movie, not first film.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3ccwut", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/3ccwut/overlooked_movies_recommendation_thread/csujrse/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3ccwut/overlooked_movies_recommendation_thread/", "name": "t1_csujrse", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1436236347.0, "created_utc": 1436236347.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3ccwut/overlooked_movies_recommendation_thread/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Are there any famous actors/actresses that were a background extra in a movie?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "movies", "link_author": "omnibishop", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cssvfew", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Granite_Man", "num_comments": 90, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_3c6buz", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_8hij1", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Since no one has mentioned him, I'll say Clint Eastwood.
