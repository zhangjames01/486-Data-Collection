We kinda live life through a series of &amp;quot;snapshots&amp;quot;, during a fight we can act or react to the information in each of these snapshots, but there is a limit to the ammount of information that can be processed and acted upon for each of these. At a very basic level it&amp;#39;s the difference of blocking and then moving, vs blocking &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; moving. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can inflate the number of things you can do per &amp;quot;snapshot&amp;quot; by having a plan, and by training, but there is an upper limit, let&amp;#39;s call it 4 things that can be done per snap shot, if trained and planned. An untrained person can probably be half as effective when properly motivated. Now lets talk about an action economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, when two parties come into conflict, the one that is able to do more things, will have the advantage. This strategy is used across war games both fantasy and real, have a larger army, zerg rush, blitzkreig, they all opperate under a similar philosophy: Attack aggresively and in higher number to secure victory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The scenario you propose, and is often proposed in the &amp;quot;N vs 1&amp;quot; questions is, in a fight which is imminent, with the aggression and numbers in favor of the attackers, how would you best defend yourself? The truth of the matter is that the scenario places virtually everyone at a disadvantage. The specific skillset of the defender is virtually irrelevant, and to truly defend yourself you must disengage and de-escalate, to win you must re-engage on advantageous terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - The action economy is real, that&amp;#39;s why the zerg are a threat.
