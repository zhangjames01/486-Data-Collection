It really scaffold the imagination - class levels have titles, the DMG talks about the magical properties of herbs and gems, there is information on the names of parts of a castle and different noble title systems, artifacts don&amp;#39;t have fixed powers but slots you fill from a common list to tailor them to your game, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are also some subtle differences.  Combat takes vs THAC0. How is it different? With the tables the second 20 entry and the 21-25 entries have a specific meaning.  With the second 20 you got on an &lt;em&gt;unmodified&lt;/em&gt; roll of 21, and 21-25 means you need an unmodified 20 and the appropriate magic item bonus to hit (so if the to hit number is 23 you need a natural 20 &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a +3 or better magic weapon).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1E has some unsavory bits that need adjusting, such as females having stat limits that are lower than all male values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2E adds secondary skills and eliminate unsavory bits, but the flavor bits are stripped out as they are &amp;quot;no longer needed&amp;quot;.  Splatbooks add lots of other styles of flavor back in, but it is not as delicious too me.  The base line scaffolding of high fantasy is gone because most buying the game were familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2E was my core system for years, and I have find memories - but without 1E I think I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had as rich off an approach.  Also, with 2E (then 3/3.5E) and the increasing complexity, I find it rather just move to Rolemaster 2nd edition instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11gbc5p", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/adnd/comments/11gbc5p/opinions_why_1st_or_2nd_over_the_other/jaq3572/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/adnd/comments/11gbc5p/opinions_why_1st_or_2nd_over_the_other/", "name": "t1_jaq3572", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/adnd", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677823228.0, "created_utc": 1677823228.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/adnd/comments/11gbc5p/opinions_why_1st_or_2nd_over_the_other/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "People are the worst.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "pics", "link_author": "adamsfan", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jalfmqs", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "mdillenbeck", "num_comments": 1206, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11f9ycv", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4ktz8", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "In the early 1990s I worked at a gas station with an outside toilet.
