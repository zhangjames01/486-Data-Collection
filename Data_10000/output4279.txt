You'll never have six million Jews marched into death camps in America either because you'll have 60 million Christians....with guns, standing in your way.\n\nThis sounds like a straw man argument, but it isn't. I am ten times more likely to die in a firearms related incident...yes, I agree, but I am also 100 times less likely to ever see this country, or even parts of it, turned into a death camp for the people that disagree with my choice of holy book, or lack thereof.\n\nI'd say the benefits outweigh the potential concerns.\n\nI apologize if this seems disrespectful of the research at hand...but you don't have to throw a rock too far back into news closet to find out what happens to unarmed populations after all. Africa has a lot good examples going back over 100 years in this regard, we don't just have to point to recent events.\n\nFirearm availability does increase the chance of firearm related fatalities...but you can apply this level of study to nearly anything. American's are ten times more likely to be directly affected by a nuclear blast than other developed countries because there are ten times more warheads targeted on US cities than there are on cities in any other part of the world.\n\nAmerican's are ten times more likely to die in a traffic fatality than other developed countries due to having a higher amount of single owner cars on the roads than almost any other country in the world.\n\nBut again...that doesn't mean your research is bad, it just means that its fundamentally correct but does not specifically show a substantial level of impact to ignore the net positives of having an armed and responsible population either.\n\nI'll trade a chance of catching a bullet for the right to live in a country where I'll never have to watch my neighbors get executed, kicked into a pit, and burned....I think that is a completely logical premise to debate your points with because violence isn't just an endemic problem within the United States \"cause guns\".

You&amp;#39;ll never have six million Jews marched into death camps in America either because you&amp;#39;ll have 60 million Christians....with guns, standing in your way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a straw man argument, but it isn&amp;#39;t. I am ten times more likely to die in a firearms related incident...yes, I agree, but I am also 100 times less likely to ever see this country, or even parts of it, turned into a death camp for the people that disagree with my choice of holy book, or lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say the benefits outweigh the potential concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I apologize if this seems disrespectful of the research at hand...but you don&amp;#39;t have to throw a rock too far back into news closet to find out what happens to unarmed populations after all.
