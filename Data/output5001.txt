Personally I think reddit is just as toxic as any other social media. I regularly find even just disagreeing with someone results in insults and condescension.\n\nThat said, there are some differences:\n\n- Subreddits allow for focused discussion. Twitter is tag based, meaning there's only one real feed, but everything has a tag so you can sort through things by tag. The result is that anyone can potentially come across anything, and therefore you have people from conflicting diaspora coming into contact. Subreddits mean that alike people are generally talking to just one another. The negative of this is that it leads to echo chambers. It also means that particular negative activity can go unnoticed e.g. the many hate subreddits that have come and gone over the years, and the many that are still around. \n\n- Comment length. Twitter comments are all short, meaning you may need to express a view in very few words. You can't caveat things, or add nuance, links, citations etc. As a result, conversations are more like exchanges of soundbites, which can be more inflammatory. Reddit gives more room for people to adequately express themselves.\n\n- Anonymity - I'd argue reddit is far worse in this aspect. You can certainly be anonymous on twitter, but not in the same way as in reddit, and a lot of accounts are public. I'd argue this can make reddit more hostile, as its easier for people to spin up accounts for the purposes of abuse/trolling.\n\n- Moderation - Twitter has moderators to some degree, but I believe these only cover things like death threats or posting of illegal content, misinformation, or clear cut abuse. Reddit community moderators meanwhile have the ability to dictate how their subreddit functions. The \"casual\" subreddits typically have a much lower tolerance for arguments, whereas others are a real free for all. Some moderators abuse their power though, and this can lead to unpleasantness.\n\n- Upvote/Downvote system - you can like stuff on Twitter, but I don't believe you can dislike. On reddit, if you downvote a comment (e.g. an abusive one), that comment can become hidden once it hits a certain threshold. In essence, this grants the users the ability to support moderation. The downside is this leads to further echo chambers, as people also downvote comments they don't like, or disagree with e.g. you're sure to receive downvotes if you comment about liking James Corden, The Big Bang Theory, or disliking popular things like Community and Keanu Reeves.
