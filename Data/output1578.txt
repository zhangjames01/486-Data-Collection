It was an old, heritage-listed house that was probably built in the 1930's or so.  Anyway, at the time my grandmother was living with my uncle, aunt, and cousin.  We're sitting there having dinner and they're asking me the typical questions about how my family is doing, telling old stories about me (I hadn't seen them in over ten years), etc. when jet lag gets the best of me.  I ask them which room I'll be staying in.\n\n\n\"You get to sleep in the master bedroom.\"\n\n*Hmm.  That's pretty generous of them.*\n\n\nThe master bedroom was on its own floor and the only way to get up to it was via a spiral staircase leading up from the lounge room.  I unpack my sleepwear, toothbrush, soap, etc. and have a shower in the attached ensuite before I go to bed.  (I *did* just arrive from a 19 hour flight.)  When I finished my shower, it occurred to me how absolutely massive that room was.  At first I thought, *Damn, this is pretty sweet*, but then realized a big bedroom (with little furnishings other than a bed) is actually kind of creepy.  You want a bedroom to be cozy.  To be intimate.\n\n\nAnyway, I shut the ensuite door, turned off the lights and went to bed.  I woke up in the middle of the night (I have no idea what time it was) and then noticed that the ensuite door was open with the lights on in there.\n\n\n*Hmmm.  That's weird.  I could've sworn I closed that door when I went to bed.*\n\n\nOne of my sleeping habits is that I absolutely must have all doors closed in whichever bedroom I'm sleeping in.  This includes closet doors, bedroom doors, ensuite doors, whatever.  It's just one of those OCD/quirks that I have.  I didn't really think anything of it at the time though and just blamed my tiredness/jetlag for forgetting to do these things.  No big deal.  I got out of bed, turned off the ensuite light, closed the door, and went back to bed.\n\n\nI jumped back into bed, then noticed how strangely cold it got all of a sudden.  I'm sure if I could see anything in the dark, I would've been able to see my breath.  I ended up just snuggling up in the blankets for warmth and went back to sleep.\n\n\nA couple of hours later I woke up because it felt like someone was breathing on me--it was a cold, steady, drawn out breath.  (When someone breaths on you, it's usually warm or neutral temperature.  This was *freezing*.)  When I opened my eyes, again I noticed that the ensuite door was open with the lights on.\n\n\n*What the fuck.  I know for a fact I closed that door and turned off the lights before.*\n\n\nI got out of bed again and took the opportunity to make sure none of the windows in the room was slightly open or something.  It was still freezing in there.  Nope.  Everything was sealed shut.  I didn't feel any drafts coming through the window cracks (as I said, it was an old house) and there was no wind outside.  I took a piss in the ensuite, turned off the lights, but as I was closing the door when I looked to the right where the spiral staircase was, I noticed what looked like the end of a long, white, flowing night dress going down the stairs.  As if I'm seeing someone walking away.  \n\n\nI called out to my grandmother and auntie but got no response.  I took a couple of steps down the staircase only to see complete darkness in the lounge room.  I didn't sleep at all for the rest of the night.\n\n\nWhen I started hearing people waking up in the morning, I got out of bed and made my way to the kitchen.  Over breakfast my aunt asked me how I slept.  I told her it was okay, but that the room upstairs is pretty drafty.  I also told her about the bathroom door/lights incidents and that I found it weird that I kept leaving them open/on.  I then asked if anyone went up to the room while I was asleep because I thought I saw someone walking down the stairs in the middle of the night.\n\n\nEveryone kind of paused what they were doing and gave each other uneasy looks.\n\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked.\n\nThey then proceeded to tell me all manner of spooky things that's happened to them in that house.  My cousin told me that she knows the exact dress I was talking about.  One time she was watching TV in the lounge room and noticed movement in the corner of her eye.
