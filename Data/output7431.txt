I want to let you know I've appreciated this conversation and will read any response you make, even though it'll doubtlessly be cold by the time I get back.\n\nI think without actual examples of what you mean precisely by \"based on science  [...] facts\" your argument here is not actually stating anything. I would say a lot of legislation is based on facts. I would say a lot of legislation is based on irrelevant facts. I would say a lot of good legislation is and should be more about values and process than it is about facts. How exactly does \"based on science\" fit into this? It's all empty words without falsifiability.\n\n&gt;  Again this is an example of \"deal the hand your dealt\" or \"suck it up\", while these are true the frustrating thing is that it can be changed, its just very difficult to, and that in and of itself is enough to make people figuratively say \"fuck it.\" I refuse that, I mean its the whole reason I made this post.\n\nFrankly, these days what I find equally frustrating are people who find protocols and policy stifling without realizing that things often are the way they are for actual reasons. See for example the bitcoin community slowly realizing it wants to recreate a lot of the systems it was excited to dump.\n\n&gt;  I bring that up as both CERN and the LHC are the products of a government that understands the value of science. Compared to our governments shunning of data.\n\nOur current government appears to be the result of forces that are mainly unconnected to science. How would policy \"based on science\" have helped here? It wouldn't because the voter does not give a damn. \"Based on science\" does not implicitly create a better government. Having a politically active society that values and understands the strengths and limitations of science, that ***would*** help. But to get there... we need healthy politics.\n\nMake sense? \"Science based politics\" does not inherently mean a healthier political environment. Both because science needs the right questions asked, and because it needs people themselves to give a damn about the science.\n\nYou can watch people living in the most scientifically advanced, healthfully, economically successful, egalitarian age that has ever lived, and see people vote against the very factors that brought them there. And in many cases, for good reason.\n\n&gt;  The fact that such a flaw like this is endemic in ALL governments means that something needs to be done about, the way a government operates needs to be completely rethought.\n\nI absolutely utterly do not understand how you think looking to science would help here. You bring up the Congo, which does demonstrate the power of government to do worse than 0. But the powers at the time were using science erroneously or in misleading ways to justify their actions. Again: science does not tell you what questions to ask.\n\nI think your way of measuring government is flawed as well. The fact that something can go to shit may just be a fundamental property of the thing itself. For example, an apple can rot, a banana peel can allow you to slip. That doesn't mean it's a terrible thing.\n\n&gt;  You add empirical science to that equation, where comparative or predictive data must support the legislation then that refines the RGB even further. Most importantly in a Science RBG the legislators would actually be required to understand the data behind the legislation.\n\nOff the top of my head:\n\n1. we can't expect our legislators to be experts in every field they legislate on. Workarounds would, I assume, have to contract out policy in ways that are ripe for corruption of the facts. Furthermore, this would take an incredibly long time.\n2. how would we get to this point?\n3. who says the science is right? There are entire industries of fake science.\n4. a lot of government is about discussing what even gets to be discussed. There's a lot of room to sideline all climate change stuff for example. I mentioned the time factor about, it seems like any legislator could just say \"climate change hasn't been studied enough\" and all the other climate change deniers would agree, and we have exactly the same situation we have now.\n\nIn other words, politics is COMPLICATED. And unfortunately, it's complicated because people and facts and communication are complicated.\n\n&gt;  For starters the academic profile of a legislator must not being one singular thing such as law or business as is such right now.\n\nI agree, (that said, there's a pipeline reason why things are the way they are, diversity in legislation is a hard problem). I would say though that a government composed nearly entirely of scientists would be incredibly shitty. I've seen few things more cringeworthy than a room full of engineers who start out thinking that because they're all rational thinkers, they must agree on the important details.\n\n&gt;  Policy is not informed by research, policy is informed by money. I don't think I need a better example than Net Neutrality and Climate Change.\n\nNegative! You have no idea what you're talking about here! Policy is informed by both. You've picked two very obvious public examples of ignoring research, while ignoring all the examples you apparently haven't heard about. Research routinely informs politicians. Certain key issues get more charged though.\n\n&gt;  Diversity through arbitrary things like race, sexuality and gender wouldn't matter. Diversity would be in thought, in experience, and the process of formulating and testing experiments (legislation). People are diverse in how they interact, not how they look.\n\n1. It's provably not arbitrary, and does matter. e.g. Just including a black man on a jury will change the decisions of the OTHER jury members towards more just decisions towards both black and white defendants. Diverse representation matters.\n2. Diversity IS diversity of thought, experience, etc. You do not have the experience of being female, if you are male, and as such you lack personal insight into women's health. We've seen this over and over and over again. From Silicon Valley, to research labs in Texas, to legislation in DC.\n\nAbout 2 up there.

I would say a lot of legislation is based on facts. I would say a lot of legislation is based on irrelevant facts. I would say a lot of good legislation is and should be more about values and process than it is about facts. How exactly does &amp;quot;based on science&amp;quot; fit into this?

Compared to our governments shunning of data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our current government appears to be the result of forces that are mainly unconnected to science. How would policy &amp;quot;based on science&amp;quot; have helped here? It wouldn&amp;#39;t because the voter does not give a damn. &amp;quot;Based on science&amp;quot; does not implicitly create a better government.
