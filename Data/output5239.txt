He staggered backwards. He raised his hand to his temple. His grip on the spear tightened, the haft curved as it was forced to hold up more of his weight.\n\nSpear stepped towards him. He reached out a hand. He wanted to help. Blue, almost on instinct, swept the spear down at his ankles. And Spear fell.\n\nBlue stood over Spear. He raised the weapon above his head. He looked down. Angry? Confused? Spear couldn\u2019t tell. He was shaking his head. Then he shut his eyes.\n\nSpear waited.\n\nSpear could have killed him. Could have beaten him. Could have taken him from this place by force. But he didn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t. It would not fix what had been broken.\n\nSpear waited.\n\nHis body hurt. Despite everything that had changed since his time in the golden field, he still felt pain. One of his eyes was swollen nearly shut. The burns on his chest stung with each breath. His arms were tired. His whole body was tired. He wanted to sleep. But he could not.\n\nSpear waited.\n\nBlue\u2019s hands quivered. His breathing was shaky. Spear could hear how loud his heart was beating. He could see how his eyes flicked between the point of the spear and Spear\u2019s face.\n\nSpear waited.\n\nFinally, his eyes landed on Spear\u2019s. He saw him. But still they were searching. Still he wanted more. What was it he needed? Spear understood now. Did Blue?\n\nAnother laboured breath. Blue swallow. \u201cChi-... ChissChiss? Chiss?\u201d It was slow. Slower than Blue was normally. The sound lacked his usual confidence. Something was different.\n\nBlue waited.\n\nSpear looked up at him. And he nodded. He raised up his hand and gave him the thumbs up.\n\nAnd Blue laughed. Not the roars of The Giant or the shrieking of Girl. It was quieter. A laugh for himself. At himself. He shook his head. The laughter died, and Blue\u2019s face became a stone once more. No fear. No hesitation. Calm and in control. The Blue that had broken Spear out of the ice all that time ago.\n\nSpear waited.\n\nBlue\u2019s form with the spear was different from Spear\u2019s. In his hand it was not an extension of his body, not a part of the hunt, but a tool. The way he held it, like a thing that needed to be controlled. Two hands. One near the base, one near the tip. No room for slip ups. His thumb came up and slid just a hair down the spear\u2019s edge. Black blood slowly spread across the point.\n\nSpear watched him shut his eyes. And when they opened, the spear became inflamed. From the haft to the head, which glowed a burning brilliant white. Spear turned his head. The light was blinding him.\n\nDevil roared out over the wind and flame erupting from his hands. \u201cDevil!\u201d And then, much quieter, only for Spear. \u201cChiss.\u201d\n\nBlue spun the spear in his hands. He turned his shoulders, turned his hips, turned his whole body. All of it to launch the spear as hard and as fast as it could go. Screaming through the air, a streak of light that washed over the rooftop. The Devil\u2019s eyes flared.\n\nTheir spear pierced his heart.\n\nThe world erupted around them. The sky darkened, thunder and lightning filled the air. The wind whipped itself into a fury. Spear dug his fingers into the stone just to keep from being carried off by it. The tower quaked and trembled, only getting more intense. The Devil\u2019s eyes faded to black. Spear shut his eyes tight. The tower was sure to fall.\n\nBut the fall never came. As quickly as the storm began, the calm followed it. Spear heard no winds. He opened his eyes. He saw no clouds. Just an unending grey sky. And a cold stone floor beneath it. Blue was no longer atop him. Spear sat up.\n\nA sigh. \u201cChissChiss?\u201d\n\nSpear looked to his side. Blue was waiting for him. He held out his arm. Spear looked at him, and he took it. Blue tried to help him up, but it was Spear who did most of the work. He was far stronger, after all. And that was okay.\n\nThe two of them turned towards The Devil\u2019s throne. It sat empty. Not even a bloodstain or a shadow to mark the thing that once ruled from it. Blue sighed. His face was as cold as ever. As unreadable as any Spear had seen. And that was okay.\n\nThat was who they were.\n\n\u201c\u00d3, eru\u00f0 \u00fei\u00f0 enn \u00e1 l\u00edfi \u00fearna?

The Giant made a huge show of waving his hand overhead at them. He was back on his feet. With some help. Girl had her arm around his waist, and he had his hand resting on her head. They were both covered in blood, most of it their own. But they were smiling. Happy.\n\nMoustache peeked out of his hiding spot. He looked about, wide eyed, before his face hardened into that scowl he always had. \u201cGreat, just great. After everything I do for you three, for *the world* I might add, and here I am leaving with less MOUSERs than I came in with.\u201d\n\nHe sighed. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no use crying over spilled oil, right? Let\u2019s just go find the RV. I\u2019m sure nothing that idiot built isn\u2019t made to survive atmospheric reentry. Not like this was a total bust anyway. Thorkell, car- Christ, you look awful. Neanderthal, help me with this.\u201d\n\nSpear\u2019s eyes widened as Moustache stood and dragged something out behind him. Other Girl. Stiff and still as always, but with eyes staring blankly into the sky. Spear knew he could not carry her himself. He walked over towards him, to carry his hunt back home. Girl noticed him, and shoved The Giant his way. She ran off towards Moustache, grabbed Other Girl in her remaining hand, and lifted her straight overhead.\n\n\u201cHuhuhu~!\u201d\n\nThe Giant clung to Spear to keep from toppling over. \u201c\u00deetta er algj\u00f6r r\u00e6fill sem \u00fe\u00fa valdir\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHoo.\u201d Spear nodded.\n\nSpear kept his friend standing, and he clapped his hand on Spear\u2019s back. \u201cF\u00f6rum h\u00e9\u00f0an. \u00c9g er a\u00f0 svelta.\u201d\n\nBlue nodded and came up to The Giant\u2019s other side. \u201cChiss. Home.\u201d\n\nMoustache and Girl were already waiting for them at the stairwell. Moustache was tapping his foot and looking down at his wrist. \u201cGet a move on, some of us have places to be. Thorkell, you\u2019re not getting paid for this, by the way. I have half a mind t-\u201d\n\n\u201c\u30aa\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30aa\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30aa\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9!!! This cannot be reeeeeeal!\u201d\n\nA horrid wailing pleasured moan broke up silence. All heads turned towards the throne. Out of a pile of bear remains, The Demon\u2019s head popped up. She looked even happier than The Giant.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t write this shit! I mean- holy crap- Baxter freakin\u2019 Stockman got his ass saved by the power of fwiendship? Some deus ex bullshit that killed, y\u2019know, the freakin\u2019 Devil! The Blue Bastard turning his back on an easy win for, what, a hunk of man meat that can\u2019t tell his ass from his elbow? Hoooooo, that is some grade A kobe despair, served ice fucking cold.\u201d She wiped a tear from her eye with one hand.\n\nThe other hand was holding Wing\u2019s weapon. And she was aiming it their way. \u201cAnd what\u2019s REALLY funny, I mean like, hilurrious, is you think you\u2019re gonna walk out with a happy little ending.

Fang\u2019s jaws descended on The Demon, and snapped shut. The weapon hit the floor, followed by a slow drip of bright pink as Fang chewed her food.\n\n**Crunch, crunch, crunch**\n\n\u201c...

She ran off towards Moustache, grabbed Other Girl in her remaining hand, and lifted her straight overhead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHuhuhu~!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant clung to Spear to keep from toppling over. \u201c\u00deetta er algj\u00f6r r\u00e6fill sem \u00fe\u00fa valdir\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHoo.\u201d Spear nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear kept his friend standing, and he clapped his hand on Spear\u2019s back. \u201cF\u00f6rum h\u00e9\u00f0an. \u00c9g er a\u00f0 svelta.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue nodded and came up to The Giant\u2019s other side. \u201cChiss. Home.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache and Girl were already waiting for them at the stairwell. Moustache was tapping his foot and looking down at his wrist. \u201cGet a move on, some of us have places to be. Thorkell, you\u2019re not getting paid for this, by the way. I have half a mind t-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u30aa\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30aa\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9\u30aa\u30fc\u30de\u30a4\u30b4\u30c3\u30c9!!! This cannot be reeeeeeal!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A horrid wailing pleasured moan broke up silence. All heads turned towards the throne. Out of a pile of bear remains, The Demon\u2019s head popped up. She looked even happier than The Giant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou can\u2019t write this shit! I mean- holy crap- Baxter freakin\u2019 Stockman got his ass saved by the power of fwiendship? Some deus ex bullshit that killed, y\u2019know, the freakin\u2019 Devil! The Blue Bastard turning his back on an easy win for, what, a hunk of man meat that can\u2019t tell his ass from his elbow? Hoooooo, that is some grade A kobe despair, served ice fucking cold.\u201d She wiped a tear from her eye with one hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other hand was holding Wing\u2019s weapon. And she was aiming it their way. \u201cAnd what\u2019s REALLY funny, I mean like, hilurrious, is you think you\u2019re gonna walk out with a happy little ending.

The weapon hit the floor, followed by a slow drip of bright pink as Fang chewed her food.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crunch, crunch, crunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c...

Blue watched him. Waiting. The disdain in his eyes was still there, still raging, but it was undercut by something else. Something Spear hadn\u2019t seen out of Blue before. Confusion? Sadness? Or maybe this was his own warrior's joy.\n\n\u201cHoo.\u201d Spear swung his Spear out to his side. A pair of rats stumbled up to join him. He smashed their heads in with the haft of his Spear.\n\nMoustache shouted from behind Fang. \u201cWhy!? Those are m-\u201d\n\n\u201cStockman.\u201d Blue pointed a hand in Moustache\u2019s direction. Stockman ducked back into cover, yelping in fear of an oncoming wave of fire. It did not come.\n\nBlue tightened his hand into a fist and raised its pair as he faced Spear. They had the same idea. This was between them.\n\nSpear did not want to fight. He didn\u2019t want to hurt Blue. He didn\u2019t want to beat Blue. He wanted Blue to come home. To stand with him in their pack. But he would not. Spear did not understand why. It was not for safety he left. Was it for happiness? He did not look happy. Spear\u2019s only thought was that it was for strength. Blue wished to be strong?\n\nSpear was strong too.\n\n\u201cHRAAAAAAAAAAGH!!\u201d\n\nSpear ran forward on all fours. His fists and his steps quaked the floor. He reached Blue in an instant. He swung his arm out at Blue. Blue caught his wrist and carried the force of his strike with him. He spun them around and threw Spear in the other direction.\n\nHe slid across the floor on his side and rolled back to his feet. Blue was a monster no more. No longer a thing of smoke and fire. He was himself. This fight was man to man.\n\nSpear charged forward again. This time, it was Blue who attacked. He swung his leg and kicked Spear in the face. Spear opened his mouth and bit into the bone of his leg. Blue sucked in a sharp breath. He beat down on the top of Spear\u2019s head with two fists. Spear snarled and shook his head side to side, dragging Blue with it.\n\nBlue kicked him again. In time with the movement of Spear\u2019s head from one way to the other. He leaned into Blue\u2019s boot, and it struck him just above the ear. Spear\u2019s vision went white and his jaw fell open. He could barely hear Blue hit the floor. He shook his head and shut his eyes. When he opened them, Blue\u2019s fist was heading right between his eyes.\n\nSpear leaned his head back. The fist reached where his head had been. He slammed his face forward. His forehead hit Blue\u2019s arm. His whole body was knocked off course. His fist skidded into the floor. His eyes widened at seeing Spear throw a punch of his own.\n\nHe caught Blue just below the arm. His knuckles smacked into Blue\u2019s ribs and threw him off to one side. Blue rolled across the floor, but stopped himself with his feet and knees. He sneered at Spear.\n\nBlue was no longer a monster, but was still as strong. Still weaker than Spear. But Spear was hurt. The scar across his chest was beating. His bones ached. His skin stung. He was so tired. He wanted to go home. But he would not go without Blue.\n\nBlue sprinted at Spear. Spear reared back and raised both fists over head. Blue dropped down. As Spear smashed his fists into the ground, Blue slid between his legs. He kicked both of Spear\u2019s knees. His legs gave out and he fell forward onto his hands. He felt Blue\u2019s boot on the back of his head, and then he felt his face smashed into the floor.\n\nBlue kept his foot planted on the back of Spear\u2019s head and neck. He twisted his heel. Spear could feel the strain in his bones. He reached back blindly and his hand found Blue\u2019s ankle. He pulled hard in the opposite direction, and Blue hit the floor. Spear pushed himself up and immediately lunged on top of him.\n\nHe pinned Blue\u2019s wrists to the floor. Blue kneed him in the crotch. Spear howled in pain. Blue spit blood in his eyes. Spear reeled back and rubbed his eyes with his fists. Blue\u2019s hand chopped into his throat.\n\nSpear fell on his back. Now Blue atop him. Spear opened his eyes. Through the redness he could see Blue pulling back his fist. Spear put his hand between it and his face, and caught Blue\u2019s punch. He squeezed. He felt the crunch of Blue\u2019s bones, and heard Blue\u2019s panicked shout.\n\nHe wrapped his legs around Spear\u2019s arm and dropped onto his back beside him. Immediately Spear\u2019s entire arm lit up in pain. Blue was pulling and pressing with his whole body. Spear\u2019s shoulder was screaming at him. Gritting his teeth, he managed to raise his arm, and Blue with it. He slammed his back into the floor again and again, until Blue had to let go and give him space.\n\nSpear rolled onto his hand and pushed back to his feet. Blue was waiting for him. His hand was a knife, and it thrust for Spear\u2019s throat. Spear swung his Spear. He smashed Blue\u2019s wrist with the haft.\n\nBlue stepped back and shook out the pain. Something was different. His gaze was no longer on Spear. It was on his Spear. Was he afraid of it? Was he planning how he could defeat it? Or was it both?\n\nSpear thrust his spear forward. Blue stepped to the side to dodge it. He grabbed Spear by the arm and pushed up on his elbow. Spear heard it **Pop** before he rammed Blue with his shoulder and forced him to step back.\n\nBlue could have snapped the Spear if he wanted to. He went for Spear himself. Why?\n\nSpear pulled his arm back and grabbed his Spear with both hands. He roared and charged Blue. Blue took in a slow breath and, just before Spear reached him, pushed the Spear to one side, and dragged Spear with it.  Blue\u2019s arm came up, and Spear smashed his throat into it. He was knocked right off his feet.\n\nBlue took one step towards him before Spear swung his Spear about angrily. Blue did not approach closer. Spear managed to get back to his feet. Huffing and breathing and so confused and angry. Why? Why any of this? Why was Blue taking care with his Spear and nothing else? Why were they even fighting?\n\nHe lashed out. He thrust his Spear again and again at Blue. He wanted him to fight back. To show that this Spear was another thing Blue would break and betray. He had to know Blue was really that far gone if he was going to beat him.\n\nBue he never did. Blue dipped and dodged and backpedalled, he even deflected a couple stabs, but he never tried to break his weapon. He stayed calm. That only made Spear angrier.\n\nHe snarled and roared. His thrusting grew more frantic, faster and less controlled. He didn\u2019t understand. Blue stepped forward, between two thrusts that went way too wide, and slammed his palm into Spear\u2019s chest. Pain shot through his body. It calmed his rage.\n\nBlue followed through. A second palm to the chest. One to his jaw. And then a sharp kick to the ankle. All one after the other, as calm and in control as Blue had ever been. That was the difference between them. When Blue\u2019s fist smacked into Spear\u2019s nose and forced him to stagger back, he started to get it.\n\nSpear steadied himself as Blue dashed forward. Spear thrust his hand out. His hand captured Blue\u2019s face. He squeezed for an instant before throwing Blue down into the floor. His head bounced off with a sick crack, and Spear kicked him back up. Blue only just landed on his feet before Spear smacked the base of his Spear into his stomach.\n\nBlue doubled over, all the air forced from his lung. Spear raised his weapon and slammed the base between his shoulder blades. Blue hit the floor.\n\nSpear kneeled down and peeled Blue\u2019s face from the floor. His eyes were open. He grimaced at Spear. He grabbed Spear\u2019s wrist and elbow. One he pulled down, the other he pushed up. In an instant, Spear\u2019s bone snapped. He couldn\u2019t feel his fingers, and Blue managed to escape his grip.\n\nSpear shut his eyes and tried to forget the pain. He focused. He had to keep calm. Had to be like Blue. Blue wanted him mad. He wanted him violent. He wanted\u2026 to die? No. He wanted something. Something else. He wanted The Devil. Why? Why why why?\n\nSpear opened his eyes. Blue had blood running down his face. He was breathing heavily. But he kept his fists up. He was ready to keep going. He would fight until he couldn\u2019t fight anymore.\n\nSpear did not run at Blue. He walked. Slowly. Calmly. That\u2019s how Blue would do it. Blue threw a quick punch at her jaw. Spear slapped it aside with the haft of his Spear. He stepped forward and punched Blue in the chest. Blue grabbed his arm. Spear grabbed his clothes. Before Blue could break another bone, Spear carried him up and into the air, and brought him crashing down to the floor.\n\nBlue coughed up blood. His eyes widened. He kicked and struggled against Spear\u2019s grip. But Spear let him go all. Being calm, fighting without rage, it gave him time to think. To remember. To ignore the rushing of his blood and beating of his heart and burning of his lungs and take in everything. It was why he now understood.\n\nHe stepped back. Blue jumped to his feet. He was breathing heavy. His eyes were still dead set on Spear\u2019s Spear. Spear looked down at it. His Spear\u2026\n\nHe turned it on its side and threw it to Blue.\n\nBlue caught it in both hands. He looked down at it. Up at Spear. He looked surprised. Confused. He looked\u2026 not in control.\n\n\u201cChiss\u2026\u201d He spoke slowly. It was his turn to not know. For once, it looked like he didn\u2019t know his next move. For once, Spear had outsmarted him. \n\nBlue gripped the haft of the spear tightly. He turned it over, twirled it, spun it, and took up a stance to fight with it. His eyes narrowed. Determination returned to him. He aimed the spear at Spear. \u201cChissChiss.\u201d\n\nSpear remembered. He remembered Blue. The day he\u2019d been broken free. The day he\u2019d been to camp. Their first hunt, their first fight, their first victory. The day they\u2019d met Moustache and The Giant. Girl. The tower. Looking at Blue now, it reminded him of all of it. It came rushing back. And, among all those memories, he remembered something else. Something Blue would give him every time they saw one another under a new sun. And something Spear wanted to give back to him.\n\nSpear looked at Blue. He gave him a thumbs up. \u201cChiss.\u201d", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spear took a deep breath, and dug in his heels.

His eyes narrowed. Determination returned to him. He aimed the spear at Spear. \u201cChissChiss.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear remembered. He remembered Blue. The day he\u2019d been broken free. The day he\u2019d been to camp. Their first hunt, their first fight, their first victory. The day they\u2019d met Moustache and The Giant. Girl. The tower. Looking at Blue now, it reminded him of all of it. It came rushing back. And, among all those memories, he remembered something else. Something Blue would give him every time they saw one another under a new sun. And something Spear wanted to give back to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear looked at Blue. He gave him a thumbs up. \u201cChiss.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10uomcg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/j7d1g2h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/", "name": "t1_j7d1g2h", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675634704.0, "created_utc": 1675634704.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Character Scramble 16 GRAND FINALS: World Is Yours", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "link_author": "OddDirective", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7d1e6b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "7thSonOfSons", "num_comments": 45, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7d1c37", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g4m6x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Eyepatch\u2019s head twisted at an odd angle. He looked down on Girl. Curiously. He grabbed his jaw and yanked his head back into place. Girl glared up at him. Snarled even. He was a full head taller than her, but she was not afraid.\n\nA flash of steel. The knife. He swiped the blade at her throat. Girl stepped back, eyes wide. He was still so fast. But she hardened herself. Her surprise turned to anger, her brow furrowed, blood running down her wrists to become a pair of swords.\n\nEyepatch swung again. He rushed forward and thrust the knife out. Girl vanished.\n\nA blur streaked behind Eyepatch and took the shape of Girl. Both swords smashed through his stone skin and drew blood of flame. Steam poured out from his wounds, billowing over Girl\u2019s arms and face. She howled and yanked her weapons free.\n\nEyepatch\u2019s grip on his knife tightened. The flame surrounding him raged brighter. It consumed his hand. And spread outward into the shape of a weapon. He hauled it forward in both hands, and fired. Streaks of flame and molten stone flew through the air.\n\nGirl ran from the shots. But she did not look afraid. She was smiling. The wide grin The Giant would wear when he fought.\n\n\u201cHwa!\u201d Girl thrust her hand forward. Four streaks of blood shot out from beneath her finger nails. Two of them Eyepatch managed to avoid. The other two pierced his stomach and spilled more of his flames.\n\nHis eye narrowed. Girl laughed at him. He fired on her again, this time flame pouring out more intensely. Girl smashed her swords together, and they became a shield. She pressed herself against it and walked forward, into the flame. Fire spilled around her, swallowing her on all sides, but Spear could see her feet carry her further towards the source.\n\nEyepatch walked forward to meet her. The closer the two got, the more immense the fire became. Until the point of his weapon met the blood of her shield. He reached out, over the shield, and grabbed Girl by the horn.\n\nHe yanked her off the ground and slammed her back into the floor. Girl coughed up blood. The blood became knives, piercing Eyepatches face and forcing him to step back. He clutched at his wound, and Girl attacked. She slammed her shield into his stomach, and pulled back. The shield became a spear.\n\n\u201cHaaaaaaa HRAH!\u201d She jammed it through Eyepatch\u2019s chest. His body straightened out and stiffened. The flame surrounding him faded.\n\n**FWOOM**\n\nHe ignited anew, brighter and hotter than before. The animals surrounding them were thrown into the air. The flames Blue had created extinguished, or were sucked into his inferno. He looked down at her. He reached down and grabbed her elbow.\n\n**CRNNK**\n\nHe crushed it in his hand.Girl screamed in agony. Spikes of blood shot through Eyepatch\u2019s hand, and turned to red steam from the fires. A sword formed in her other hand. Eyepatch raised his arm in front of his face. But she did not swing for him.\n\nShe swung the sword down and sliced through her own arm.\n\nShe leaped backwards. Eyepatch looked down at her discarded limb and tossed it aside. Blood poured from her wound, until it stopped. Hardened. It formed a new arm and hand at the end of her elbow. She swung her arm forward, and the blood lashed out like a whip.\n\nEyepatch raised his knife and sliced through her blood fist. The two halves continued forward, around and beyond him. Her fingers grew into spikes and pierced the floor. The blood connecting her fingers to her arm reeled Girl forward. Her knee slammed into Eyepatch\u2019s face.\n\nHis head snapped back as she flew past. Flames poured out from his face. He raised his hand to catch it, and it gathered into a ball in his hand. He turned and hurled it after her.\n\nGirl raised her hand up. Her horns shrank as the blood swept down her arm. It churned and swirled outward. It took the shape of a monster, wide, toothy jaws that swallowed the fireball with a *hiss.* She leaned around her monster and smirked. \u201cHeh.\u201d\n\nSpear had never seen anything like it. Even understanding it was beyond him. He could only watch. He took note of The Giant and of Moustache, keeping them safe with his eyes, not willing to lose another. He knew Girl would be safe if he took his eyes off her for a moment.\n\nWhen he looked back at her, she was face to face with Eyepatch. He was swiping his claws at her. She was doing her best to avoid them. Swaying back and and back, under his attacks, till *WHACK* kicking him hard in the knee.\n\nEyepatch hit the floor. He grabbed Girl by the ankle and yanked her down with him. She stomped on his face and pulled her leg free. Flames leaked out from his body. He pointed forward, and it raced towards Girl. She swung her arm. Her horns shortened, and blood splashed over the fire, and fizzled it out.\n\nShe jumped to her feet and put her hands on her hips. \u201cAhahaha!!\u201d\n\nEyepatch slammed his hand into the floor. He pushed himself to his feet. The fire of his blood formed a huge claw at the end of his hand. Girl copied the move exactly.\n\nThey were slower now. His body was stone and flame, but Eyepatch had taken brutal damage from his battles. Girl had lost a lot of blood. From her horns, her arm, her wrist, Spear could see her body going pale. But still they fought.\n\nGirl dragged her claw across the ground. Eyepatch raised his overhead. Her claw scraped through the stone until it thrust up. She was grinning. The massive talon became a waterfall of blood that splashed and washed over Eyepatch. By the time his arm came down, his fire had been extinguished. The claw that came down only managed to drag two nails over one of Girl\u2019s eyes.\n\nHe\u2019d become slower still. Girl\u2019s blood still clung to him. The black mass that was Eyepatch still burned hot, and that blood hardened and grew sticky. But Girl\u2019s blood had run its course. One missing one, one missing arm, she had paid much just to get this far.\n\nBut still she smiled. Even dodging Eyepatch\u2019s slow punches, she smiled. She looked away from him. Looked instead to The Giant. She held out her hand. \u201cHaaah! Wah!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u00d3, n\u00fa \u00fearftu hj\u00e1lp m\u00edna? Ertu ekki b\u00fainn a\u00f0 taka n\u00f3g af m\u00e9r?\u201d\n\nThe Giant coughed up a laugh. And he threw his axe to her. The massive weapon dragged Girl\u2019s arm down with her. But she hoisted it up and onto her shoulder regardless. Her grip tightened. Her muscles tensed. And she swung the axe at Eyepatch\u2019s head.\n\nHe tried to move. Even slow as he was, the axe was slower. It was an attack that would never hit him. Could never hit him. But Girl made it so.\n\nShe tugged back the stump of her arm. A single thread of blood that ran down her body, down her leg, and across the floor. Her arm! It flung through the air, and wrapped it\u2019s fingers around the back of Eyepatch\u2019s head. The axe swung down, and Eyepatch\u2019s head carried forward. His eye widened.\n\n#SHWING\n\n#THOOM\n\nHe stood, perfectly still. The Giant\u2019s axe impaled itself into the ground between his legs. She looked up at him, breathing heavily. She reached out and tapped him. His body split straight down the middle. Both halves flopped to the floor, and a puddle of blood sploshed between them.\n\nGirl beat her fist against her chest. \u201cAWAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!\u201d\n\nSpear jumped to his feet. She had done it! She had won! Their pack could be whole again! The war of bear and rat was only a few strays on each side. Moustache had taken cover behind Fang. Girl now leaned against The Giant\u2019s axe and slept in the middle of the roof. \n\nTheir fight was over. They needed only kill the-\n\n\u201cDevil.\u201d\n\nSpear\u2019s blood ran cold. He turned his head towards the sound. Towards Blue. He had woken up. How long had he been up? How had Spear lost track of him, stopped watching him, left him unsafe? With the way he was staring at Girl and Eyepatch\u2019s battle, long enough.\n\nBlue took a deep breath and forced himself to stand. \u201cDevil. ChissChissChiss. Chiss.\u201d\n\nThe Devil\u2019s eyes smouldered. Blue brought his arms in front of his chest. Another deep breath. He tightened all of his muscles at once. The black stoneskin that covered his limbs, the burning red that filled his veins, it shrank. It condensed with each breath, each beat of his heart, until it *was* his heart, a glowing orange that beat and beat. His eyes were red once more. Not the hateful fire of the Devil. Blue\u2019s. Crisp. Clear. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nHe motioned towards Spear. Spear shut his eyes. He nodded. Spear stood across from him. Blue would not stop. Blue had to show something, prove something, be something, do something. Spear still wasn\u2019t sure what. But he had to end this.\n\nHe took up his Spear. He understood now.\n\nHe would need to use it.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch\u2019s head twisted at an odd angle.

Immediately his legs groaned and his lungs burned. He had to calm down, he had to rest. Blue\u2019s fire still raged around him. But even still, he wanted to be out there. He wanted to be by Wings. He wanted to understand. He had looked away for only a few seconds, how could this happen? How could he have not seen it?\n\nEyepatch was in a frenzy. He carved his way across the battlefield and slid next to Wings on his knees. He pressed his ear to his chest. \u201cHey, Hey! Twenty One!\u201d He picked him up and shook him. More of his blood poured out onto the floor. \u201cHey, get a hold of yourself. This shit\u2019s not funny, we gotta get some mutagen in you, you\u2019re makin\u2019 a mess.\u201d\n\nHe pulled a tiny glass full of green liquid from under his shirt. He ripped off the top and poured the potion down Wings\u2019 throat. He splashed it onto his chest and face. Nothing changed. Wings stayed motionless.\n\nSlowly, Eyepatch set him down and stood up. He reached out, and took the hulking weapon he\u2019d given to Wings off the floor. He was breathing deep and slowly. So deeply Spear could see the rise and fall of his shoulders. He looked about for a moment, until he found Ocean.\n\nOcean was pointing his weapon at Eyepatch. He took a quick aim, and **BANG** fired on Eyepatch.\n\nEyepatch didn\u2019t blink. He didn\u2019t even flinch. Even as the shot tore through his shoulder and sprayed blood behind him. He hoisted up his own weapon in both hands. And he fired back.\n\n#BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\n\nIt was like lightning. The flash from his weapon was blinding. The sound was an immense roar. A storm of metal filled the air, and filled Ocean. Shots tore through his clothes, his skin, and his body. Red and pink mist exploded out the other side. Ocean\u2019s body twitched and bled and spasmed with every shot that ripped him apart. He didn\u2019t even have time to scream.\n\n*Click, Click, Click*\n\nThe attack ended. Eyepatch still pulled the trigger, but the storm ended almost as quickly as it began. Ocean\u2019s body flopped to the floor, and faded out of sight. He was gone. But Wings was still there. Wings was still dead.\n\nSpear felt a pang in his heart. Eyepatch and Wings had been together as long as he\u2019d known them. They were a pack. Family. And now he was dead. And Eyepatch was alone. Spear knew the feeling. He remembered it. The rage and the violence could bury the sadness for now, but it wouldn\u2019t last. The loneliness was the worst part.\n\nIt was why he fought now. Why he wouldn\u2019t let Blue go. Why he wanted so badly to be by Eyepatch's side. But he couldn\u2019t. He could barely breathe. He could only watch as Eyepatch sank to his knees, and stared at his hands.\n\nBut Eyepatch wasn\u2019t alone. Something else was with him now. Out of his shadow, hands crept up onto his shoulders. A head leaned in, whispering and speaking for Eyepatch and Eyepatch alone. Spear couldn\u2019t hear it, not this far away and not through the last breaths of the fire, but he knew it was not what Eyepatch needed.\n\nThe Demon coiled around him. She walked around Eyepatch, hands behind her back. Moustache was barking something, trying to command his rats, or trying to call out to Eyepatch. Neither came. Not soon enough. Spear watched as the light in Eyepatch\u2019s eye lost its light. And the longer The Demon was near him, the grayer his gaze became. The more his shoulders slumped. The more his hands trembled.\n\nThe Demon kneeled behind him and ran her hand beneath his chin. She whispered some curse into his ear. And she patted him twice on the back. She was smiling. A huge wicked grin.\n\nEyepatch stood up. He took out his knife.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026\u201d It was strange. He was whispering, but Spear could hear it. It was loud. Louder than the flames. Something in Eyepatch had changed. He pointed his knife up at The Devil. \u201cHey\u2026 you lookin\u2019 to make contracts, right? Sign me the hell up. You let me kill all these bastards, and I\u2019ll give you everything.\u201d\n\n\u201c... Hob? Hob!? What the hell are you talking about? That thing and that girl are the whole reason we\u2019re in this mess, are you listening to yourself?\u201d Moustache was angry. He took a few steps towards Eyepatch, but came to a dead stop when his knife was turned on him.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t change, do ya?\u201d Eyepatch\u2019s wrist was shaking. \u201cOl\u2019 Baxter Stockman, same as it ever was. Soon as shit hits the fan, nothing\u2019s ever your fault. Nothing\u2019s ever your responsibility. You just stand back and stick around like a cockroach, and bring everyone around you down. Well, shame on me for falling for it, right? But I\u2019m done with the second chance bullshit. You\u2019re not getting out of this one.\u201d\n\nThe tower began to rumble. The air grew heavy. So heavy Spear fell to his knee and could not stand. He looked up, and felt despair.\n\nThe Devil moved.\n\nRaising its arm seemed such an impossible feat Spear could not dare attempt it. The clanging rats and bears fell silent and still. Time froze to allow The Devil his peace. Its hand dug into the side of its throne, and pressed in. Its fingers sank into the stone like water. A bright red glow surrounded Eyepatch.\n\nThe floor beneath him cracked and bubbled. Flame vented out around his feet. He stood defiantly. Unmoving. The fire roared into a grand pillar. A foul smell filled the air as it consumed Eyepatch. The smell of hair and skin being melted away. Consumed by the fire. And just as quickly, it ended.\n\nA monster took his place. A black mass of muscle and anger, its own body fueling the fire that surrounded it. A single yellow, hateful eye swept over everything. If not for the knife it still clutched so tightly, Spear would not have believed it was the same man. Eyepatch screamed, so full of rage and pain that Spear had to cover his ears.\n\nThe roar faded, replaced by the cackling of The Demon. She was doubled over in pain from how hard she laughed. Eyepatched stomped forward, slowly but unstoppably, every step leaving behind fresh flames. The animals around him melted as quickly as he drew close. But below even that, he heard a whimper.\n\nGirl. Her face was pressed against Fang\u2019s body. Pushing her and The Giant across the roof. Trying to escape. Escape The Devil, or Eyepatch? Spear couldn\u2019t tell. But she looked afraid. He wanted to be by her side. He wanted to fight and kill the things that scared her. He willed his body to move, but still he could not. Not under the weight of The Devil\u2019s presence. What he could do-\n\n\u201cHRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\u201d\n\nHe roared out across the roof, echoing in the empty, still air. He snapped the world out of its silence. The animals returned to their war. Moustache scrambled away from Eyepatch. More than that, what Spear had hoped for, The Giant awoke.\n\n\u201cEh\u2026?\u201d He looked down. Tired eyes swept over the battlefield. Then settled on Girl. He thunked his fist down between her horns. \u201cGet ekki einu sinni sofi\u00f0 \u00feegar \u00fe\u00fa ert dau\u00f0ur\u2026\u201d\n\nGirl looked up. \u201cHwa?\u201d\n\nThe Giant sighed. He still looked weak, but not so weak he couldn\u2019t yank Girl up and onto her feet. \u201cSvo \u00fe\u00fa ert hr\u00e6ddur?

Bardagi!\u201d\n\nHe dragged his fingers down her face. Blood ran from her forehead to her chin. Her shoulders settled. The hitching in her chest settled. She nodded at The Giant. \u201cAaa.\u201d\n\nShe shoved him to the floor. She ran her fingers over the gash in Fang\u2019s side. Her blood shivered and pooled around Girl\u2019s fingers. Girl breathed in deep, and let the blood from her and Fang and The Giant race upward and collected in her horns. She was awash in red.\n\nShe stood tall and roared out her challenge. \u201cHrrrrrr\u2026 Haaaaaaaa!!!\u201d\n\nEyepatched looked over his shoulder.\n\nGirl lunged forward and punched him in the face.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spear jumped to his feet. Immediately his legs groaned and his lungs burned. He had to calm down, he had to rest. Blue\u2019s fire still raged around him. But even still, he wanted to be out there. He wanted to be by Wings. He wanted to understand. He had looked away for only a few seconds, how could this happen? How could he have not seen it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch was in a frenzy. He carved his way across the battlefield and slid next to Wings on his knees. He pressed his ear to his chest. \u201cHey, Hey! Twenty One!\u201d He picked him up and shook him. More of his blood poured out onto the floor. \u201cHey, get a hold of yourself. This shit\u2019s not funny, we gotta get some mutagen in you, you\u2019re makin\u2019 a mess.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pulled a tiny glass full of green liquid from under his shirt. He ripped off the top and poured the potion down Wings\u2019 throat. He splashed it onto his chest and face. Nothing changed. Wings stayed motionless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly, Eyepatch set him down and stood up. He reached out, and took the hulking weapon he\u2019d given to Wings off the floor. He was breathing deep and slowly. So deeply Spear could see the rise and fall of his shoulders. He looked about for a moment, until he found Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ocean was pointing his weapon at Eyepatch. He took a quick aim, and &lt;strong&gt;BANG&lt;/strong&gt; fired on Eyepatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch didn\u2019t blink. He didn\u2019t even flinch. Even as the shot tore through his shoulder and sprayed blood behind him. He hoisted up his own weapon in both hands. And he fired back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was like lightning. The flash from his weapon was blinding. The sound was an immense roar.

He didn\u2019t want to. The flames, he saw things in them. Things he wanted to ignore. Questions demanding answers. He looked beyond them. Past them. To the battle that raged beyond.\n\nThe bears and the rats were at war. Bears pawed and clawed away at the sea of chomping metal surrounding tem. Rats bit and burrowed and swarmed around the bears. Both exploded or tore into metal bits when the other would kill them. Both swarms, who had seemed so innumerous not long ago, were beginning to thin. And within the war, a smaller battle was being fought.\n\nThe Demon stood at the feet of The Devil. She was howling and cackling, snapping her fingers and directing the largest and strongest of the bears wherever she desired. \n\nOpposite her, close to the doorway they\u2019d come in from, was Moustache. He was doing everything he could to stay away from the bears. The largest swarm of rats stayed near to him, leaping and snapping and killing and dying in droves to keep him safe. It was hard to keep track of him among their numbers.\n\nAbove them, Wings buzzed in his fight with Ocean. He fired at Ocean, Ocean fired back. Neither could hit the other. Wings was unskilled, and by the smell, Ocean wasn\u2019t in his right mind. They were both islands untouched by the war around them. Not worth much of Spear\u2019s attention. They would be there all day.\n\nBelow them, Spear\u2019s eyes were drawn to the fight between Eyepatch and Other Girl. Those he understood. Other Girl was protecting The Demon. Eyepatch was trying to kill her to reach The Demon. It was good to focus on. It kept Spear\u2019s mind from wandering.\n\nEyepatch was relentless. He kept close to Other Girl as much as possible. His claws sliced and scratched at her again and again. But Other Girl was a stone. Her face didn\u2019t change, her blood never spilled, she fought back almost like Blue would. Calmly. As if she were in control.\n\nThat just made Eyepatch angrier.\n\nHe kicked her in the stomach. She wobbled back a few steps. He dragged his fist along his mouth and spat on the floor. \u201cThe hell are you made of, huh? Bax\u2019s junk usually folds if you hit it hard enough.\u201d\n\nThe Demon draped her arms over Other Girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI know, right? Gawd he is just the WORST!\u201d She ran her hand under Other Girl\u2019s face. \u201cDoor\u2019s some real primo shit. Top of the line tech inside and out, courtesy of one grieving old windbag. A sweet little shell to download his dead kid's brain into.\u201d\n\nSpear barely noticed Eyepatch reaching for a weapon at waist. It was slow. Deliberately slow. He was keeping them distracted. \u201cSo what, she\u2019s your daughter? I know things are different over in Japan but I didn\u2019t think it was that bad.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u4eba\u7a2e\u5dee\u5225\u7684\u3067\u66b4\u529b\u7684\u3001\u79c1\u306f\u3042\u306a\u305f\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059.\u201d The Demon cackled. \u201cNo. No Door\u2019s no one\u2019s kid anymore. Y\u2019know for a million billion dollar computer or whatever, her brain still fizzles like a CRT if you swipe a magnet over her face!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, perhaps it\u2019s best we stay foc-\u201d\n\n**BANG BANG**\n\nEyepatch fired twice, both aimed at The Demon. Both shots hit Other Girl in the face. They dropped to the floor harmlessly. \u201c-ed on settling this.\u201d\n\nThe Demon rolled her eyes and pushed Other Girl on her shoulders. She didn\u2019t budge, but she walked forward anyway. \u201cYeah, yeah, just make sure it hurts. I freakin\u2019 hate cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, Master.\u201d Other Girl raised her hands. \u201cBut only because you ask so nicely.\u201d\n\nOther Girl darted forward. Spear wouldn\u2019t have guessed she could move that fast. She snatched the weapon out of Eyepatch\u2019s hand. Eyepatch only just looked down when her palm came up and smashed into his chin. He grit his teeth and clenched his fists, but only got a second palm for his efforts. This one to the chest.\n\nEyepatch staggered backwards. Other Girl walked towards him.\n\n\u201cStockman, you rat bastard!\u201d Eyepatch howled. \u201cGet off your ass and do something!\u201d\n\nMoustache shouted in response. And Other Girl stopped. She turned her head. A swarm of rats were screeching and charging her. She raised her arm and took aim for only a second.\n\n**BANG BANG BANGBANGBANGBANG**\n\nSix shots. Six rats flopped uselessly on the floor. Also pierced through the skull. Other Girl shook the weapon before throwing it forward. Two more rats were smashed apart. The last rats lunged at her, but their bites and scratches only tore her clothes. She still refused to bleed.\n\nShe brushed the rats off and turned towards Eyepatch. But Eyepatch had another weapon.\n\n**PRROW**\n\nThe long, wide weapon that had been slung over his back, now lay in his hands. It fired off a solid chunk of metal, a miniature death ball, that smashed into Other Girl like a fist. She flew back and landed sitting. But another **PRROW** launched a ball into her forehead, and smacked her head against the floor.\n\nEyepatch laughed as he pulled two\u2026 fruits from his belt. He yanked the stems off both with his teeth and tossed them at Other Girl. She had started to sit up when\n\n#THOOM\n\nTwo explosions went off around her, even stronger than the one Blue had created with the bear\u2019s blood. As tough as Other Girl was, strong enough to hurt even her. She did not bleed, but a crack formed across the skin along her leg. Her arm hung loose and limp at her side. No pain showed on her face as she slowly started to stand.\n\nToo slow. Eyepatch was like Spear. He hunted and knew the hunt was not over merely when one side was hurt. He was like Blue, and knew to fight when your enemy could not move, to strike their weaknesses.\n\nEyepatch aimed down his weapon.\n\n**PRROW**\n\nA metal ball shot forward at her chest. It struck her hand! Even with as hurt as she was, she managed to catch the shot! Smoke plumed from her hand, and the ball hit the floor. She rose to her feet. One of her legs was cracked, she leaned heavily on one side. But she was up.\n\nShe raised up her hands. Her movements were jittery. \u201cMas- Master. I seem to be having some difficulties maintaining motor function. Some assis-sistance would be appreciated.\u201d\n\nThe Demon snorted. \u201cYou look like a freakin\u2019 wreck, Door. How about more of that ninja shit, that\u2019ll get you out of this!\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstood. Engaging in \u2018nin-ninja shit\u2019.\u201d\n\nOther Girl walked forward. Eyepatch ran at her. He flipped his weapon in his hands and swung it like a club at her head. Other Girl raised her arm to block. The weapon snapped in half against her forearm, and her arm cracked in return. Her other hand snatched up Eyepatch by his neck and lifted him off the floor. He kicked her in the teeth.\n\nHer head snapped back with a painful crunching sound. It snapped right back. That same dead expression. She released Eyepatch. Before he hit the ground she tapped his chest with two fingers. He howled in pain and dropped to one knee, clutching the space she\u2019d touched.\n\nShe took a step closer and raised her hand. Her mouth was moving. Spear couldn\u2019t hear her. Not over the sound of another swarm of rats moving in on her. This wave was far taller and denser, and Other Girl with no weapon to protect her. It made little difference. A single touch was all it took to smash apart a rat. One, two, three-\n\nAn arm shot out from between the rats. Moustache! He had hidden himself among them! In his hand was a shiny silver wheel, only as wide as his palm. He reached out, nearly touching Other Girl\u2019s face, and swiped it down. Her eyes went grey, and filled with images of a snowstorm. Her body went still, and then collapsed into a limp pile.\n\nThe rats poured out from around Moustache, returning to guard him from the suddenly alert bears. But he looked proud. He turned the ring over between his fingers. \u201cYou were saying something about magnets, hmm?\u201d\n\nEyepatch hacked up a laugh. \u201cChrist, couldn\u2019t come in any sooner could you? Had to wait for me to eat shit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate you playing distraction, Mr. Hob.\u201d Moustache looked down at Other Girl. \u201cBut getting my hands on this one has become a priority. After all this-\u201d\n\nThe Demon\u2019s heel came down on the back of Other Girl\u2019s head. She leaned in close to Moustache. \u201cAfter all this what, you think you\u2019re going home? You think I need robo-bitch to kill you? Bzzzzzzzt, wrong, sorry. All I need to do is wait and you guys\u2019ll kill yourselves!\u201d\n\nEyepatch pulled out out a knife and moved closer to her. \u201cWatch it sister. Just call off the bears and we can all walk away. I don\u2019t blame no one for wantin\u2019 to ruin Stockman\u2019s day-\u201d\n\n\u201cI very much do!\u201d\n\n\u201c-But now the fun\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nThe Demon sighed, loud and low. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. Parties over.\u201d She grinned. \u201cBut not for me. Dumbass. Puhuhuhu~!\u201d\n\n**BANG**\n\nSpear turned his head. Moustache turned his head. Eyepatch turned his head. None of them had fired. None of them had been hit.\n\nEyepatch\u2019s eye widened. He sprinted across the roof, slicing through bears that got too close. Spear followed him with his eyes, and continued to where he was going. And he saw it. There, in the centre of the roof, in a pool of dark red blood, was Wings.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spear couldn\u2019t think. He didn\u2019t want to. The flames, he saw things in them. Things he wanted to ignore. Questions demanding answers. He looked beyond them. Past them. To the battle that raged beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bears and the rats were at war. Bears pawed and clawed away at the sea of chomping metal surrounding tem. Rats bit and burrowed and swarmed around the bears. Both exploded or tore into metal bits when the other would kill them. Both swarms, who had seemed so innumerous not long ago, were beginning to thin. And within the war, a smaller battle was being fought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon stood at the feet of The Devil. She was howling and cackling, snapping her fingers and directing the largest and strongest of the bears wherever she desired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Opposite her, close to the doorway they\u2019d come in from, was Moustache. He was doing everything he could to stay away from the bears. The largest swarm of rats stayed near to him, leaping and snapping and killing and dying in droves to keep him safe. It was hard to keep track of him among their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Above them, Wings buzzed in his fight with Ocean. He fired at Ocean, Ocean fired back. Neither could hit the other. Wings was unskilled, and by the smell, Ocean wasn\u2019t in his right mind. They were both islands untouched by the war around them. Not worth much of Spear\u2019s attention. They would be there all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below them, Spear\u2019s eyes were drawn to the fight between Eyepatch and Other Girl. Those he understood. Other Girl was protecting The Demon. Eyepatch was trying to kill her to reach The Demon. It was good to focus on. It kept Spear\u2019s mind from wandering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch was relentless. He kept close to Other Girl as much as possible. His claws sliced and scratched at her again and again. But Other Girl was a stone. Her face didn\u2019t change, her blood never spilled, she fought back almost like Blue would. Calmly. As if she were in control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That just made Eyepatch angrier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He kicked her in the stomach. She wobbled back a few steps. He dragged his fist along his mouth and spat on the floor. \u201cThe hell are you made of, huh? Bax\u2019s junk usually folds if you hit it hard enough.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon draped her arms over Other Girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI know, right? Gawd he is just the WORST!\u201d She ran her hand under Other Girl\u2019s face. \u201cDoor\u2019s some real primo shit. Top of the line tech inside and out, courtesy of one grieving old windbag. A sweet little shell to download his dead kid&amp;#39;s brain into.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear barely noticed Eyepatch reaching for a weapon at waist. It was slow. Deliberately slow. He was keeping them distracted. \u201cSo what, she\u2019s your daughter? I know things are different over in Japan but I didn\u2019t think it was that bad.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c\u4eba\u7a2e\u5dee\u5225\u7684\u3067\u66b4\u529b\u7684\u3001\u79c1\u306f\u3042\u306a\u305f\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059.\u201d The Demon cackled. \u201cNo. No Door\u2019s no one\u2019s kid anymore. Y\u2019know for a million billion dollar computer or whatever, her brain still fizzles like a CRT if you swipe a magnet over her face!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMaster, perhaps it\u2019s best we stay foc-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BANG BANG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch fired twice, both aimed at The Demon. Both shots hit Other Girl in the face. They dropped to the floor harmlessly. \u201c-ed on settling this.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon rolled her eyes and pushed Other Girl on her shoulders. She didn\u2019t budge, but she walked forward anyway. \u201cYeah, yeah, just make sure it hurts. I freakin\u2019 hate cats.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOf course, Master.\u201d Other Girl raised her hands. \u201cBut only because you ask so nicely.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other Girl darted forward. Spear wouldn\u2019t have guessed she could move that fast. She snatched the weapon out of Eyepatch\u2019s hand. Eyepatch only just looked down when her palm came up and smashed into his chin. He grit his teeth and clenched his fists, but only got a second palm for his efforts. This one to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch staggered backwards. Other Girl walked towards him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cStockman, you rat bastard!\u201d Eyepatch howled. \u201cGet off your ass and do something!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache shouted in response. And Other Girl stopped. She turned her head. A swarm of rats were screeching and charging her. She raised her arm and took aim for only a second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BANG BANG BANGBANGBANGBANG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Six shots. Six rats flopped uselessly on the floor. Also pierced through the skull. Other Girl shook the weapon before throwing it forward. Two more rats were smashed apart. The last rats lunged at her, but their bites and scratches only tore her clothes. She still refused to bleed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She brushed the rats off and turned towards Eyepatch. But Eyepatch had another weapon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRROW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The long, wide weapon that had been slung over his back, now lay in his hands. It fired off a solid chunk of metal, a miniature death ball, that smashed into Other Girl like a fist. She flew back and landed sitting. But another &lt;strong&gt;PRROW&lt;/strong&gt; launched a ball into her forehead, and smacked her head against the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch laughed as he pulled two\u2026 fruits from his belt. He yanked the stems off both with his teeth and tossed them at Other Girl. She had started to sit up when&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;THOOM&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two explosions went off around her, even stronger than the one Blue had created with the bear\u2019s blood. As tough as Other Girl was, strong enough to hurt even her. She did not bleed, but a crack formed across the skin along her leg. Her arm hung loose and limp at her side. No pain showed on her face as she slowly started to stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too slow. Eyepatch was like Spear. He hunted and knew the hunt was not over merely when one side was hurt. He was like Blue, and knew to fight when your enemy could not move, to strike their weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch aimed down his weapon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRROW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A metal ball shot forward at her chest. It struck her hand! Even with as hurt as she was, she managed to catch the shot! Smoke plumed from her hand, and the ball hit the floor. She rose to her feet. One of her legs was cracked, she leaned heavily on one side. But she was up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She raised up her hands. Her movements were jittery. \u201cMas- Master. I seem to be having some difficulties maintaining motor function. Some assis-sistance would be appreciated.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon snorted. \u201cYou look like a freakin\u2019 wreck, Door. How about more of that ninja shit, that\u2019ll get you out of this!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUnderstood. Engaging in \u2018nin-ninja shit\u2019.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other Girl walked forward. Eyepatch ran at her. He flipped his weapon in his hands and swung it like a club at her head. Other Girl raised her arm to block. The weapon snapped in half against her forearm, and her arm cracked in return. Her other hand snatched up Eyepatch by his neck and lifted him off the floor. He kicked her in the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her head snapped back with a painful crunching sound. It snapped right back. That same dead expression. She released Eyepatch.

The roof was bathed in the glow of its gaze. It was as if the sun itself had risen. A great and terrible sun.\n\nBlue groaned and thrashed about in Spear\u2019s grip. He was burning. Smoke was surrounding them, his body was hot to the touch. His back and his chest were cooking Spear, hardening and blackening even beneath his clothes.\n\nSpear grimaced through the pain. He would not let go. Blue grabbed his wrists. A sharp pain shot through him. He would not let go. The smell, a mix of burning hair and skin, was making Spear feel ill. He would not let go. \n\nBut slowly, agonisingly, Blue pried Spear\u2019s hands off his chest. The instant he had a way out, he took it. He slipped out of Spear\u2019s grasp. Spear lunged to recapture him. Blue kicked him in the chest, dropping him a few metres back.\n\nSpear hit the ground on all fours. He reached up and felt his chest. It hurt. The kick had hurt him. More than the scratch or the burns, *Blue* had hurt him. But why? They were together, there was no need for them to fight. They had overcome everything. There was no need to hurt. Why struggle? Why fight?\n\nHe looked up at Blue. He was stiff as a stone. His skin had charred, his eyes were fire. But the way he stood. Tight and controlled. In charge. That was still Blue. Wasn\u2019t he?\n\nBoth of their eyes travelled down. On the floor between them was His Spear. He widened his eyes and ran for it. Blue dove forward just a second earlier. But that new body of his was stiff. He didn\u2019t move like he had in the swamp or in the cave. But it meant he could get His Spear back.\n\nAnd once more they were close.\n\nBlue stood before him. He did not strike. He only looked at the Spear. He would not even look at him. Only at his weapon. It was all he saw.\n\nSpear pushed himself on his feet, and leaned on the Spear. In his hands, it was his Spear. Nothing more. It was a tool to hunt. To kill. Sometimes for protection, often for food. It had saved him, once. Probably countless more times. And now he had the chance to save someone else with it. He would not raise his Spear.\n\nBlue\u2019s eyes narrowed. He stepped still closer to Spear. \u201cChiss! Chiss!\u201d His calm and cool voice had grown hoarse, like a landslide. Even his breathing sounds laboured. He raised up his hand, flat like a knife. \u201cChissChiss\u2026 Chiss.\u201d\n\nHe cut through the air. Spear caught it. It burned his skin immediately. He would not let go. He spun, and dragged Blue with him. His back hit the floor hard. If Blue wished to fight, he would fight. But only that. He would not kill. He would not return Blue\u2019s mistakes.\n\nHe stomped his foot where Blue\u2019s head lay. The stone crumbled beneath as Blue rolled to avoid. Blue flicked his wrist, and shards of molten stone dug into his ankle. Spear quickly patted out the small flame that came with it, but Blue took his chance to get back to his feet.\n\nHis eyes were still focused, but his face had changed. He looked different somehow. Focused, but not on the fight. On something far beyond it.\n\nBlue\u2019s fingers crunched as he snapped them. One of The Demon\u2019s bears, as tall as The Giant, lunged between them. But Spear had fought bigger, killed bigger. It was nothing. He only lashed out because it now kept him from Blue.\n\nBut it was Blue who struck first. Blue who shoved his hand through the bear\u2019s back. Blue who pulled free metal innards and organs. And as the bear\u2019s glowing eye faded, he pulled out a glass container of black liquid.\n\nHe snapped the top of the container off and threw it at Spear. The liquid spilled out in a line before Spear caught the bottle. What was it? A gift? He sniffed it. Ech. Not a drink\u2026\n\nBlue ran his hand down his arms. A small shower of sparks hit the floor. The line of black ignited. Spear\u2019s eyes widened and he raised his arms to-\n\n**Kra-BOOM**\n\nSpear was blown back in a fiery blast. He hit a stone pillar with a horrid crack. But it was only the pillar that broke, not Spear. That did not mean he was safe.\n\nHe patted out small fires in his hair and his cloth. Blue sneered at him. He leaned down, and dipped his hands into the flame. From his palm, the fire darkened. A bright orange to a dull red. He swept his hand forward, and the fire followed. A wall of flame raced to meet Spear.\n\nSpear leaped up and took cover behind the pillar. Flames spilled out around the sides, pouring still forward and over the edge of the tower. He could hear Blue continuing to send flame after flame his way.\n\nThe pillar was breaking down. The crack Spear had made was deepening. Each impact of flame brought it closer to breaking, toppling down atop Spear or sacrificing him to fire. The pillar was growing warm against his back.\n\nSpear turned and reeled his arm back. He could see Blue about to cast another flame. He punched the pillar. It exploded into a cloud of dust and stone, made all the worse by Blue\u2019s flames and smoking mixing into the air.\n\nSpear vanished into the cloud. Blue had fire, but fire was not a hunter. Fire had no eyes to find him, no nose to track him. And in the sudden darkness, even Blue\u2019s senses were dulled. \n\nThe very flame he carried was his undoing. It led Spear to see him. To hear him murmuring and muttering. The swish of his clothes as he searched. Too slow. Too inexperienced. Spear was already behind him. He lunged, wrapping one arm around Blue\u2019s neck and pressing his fist against his chest. Squeezing.\n\nHe howled as Blue slammed his elbow into his scar. He burned, he hurt, but he would not let go. Blue and his fire were alike in one way: the need to breathe.\n\nBlue thrashed in his grip. He twisted about like a snake. His skin still singed and smoked and cooked Spear everywhere it touched. But Spear would not let go. He lifted Blue off the floor, his feet kicking uselessly. He wretched and coughed as he fought for air. He tried to call out. \u201cDev- urk\u2026\u201d\n\nBut Spear would not let go. He squeezed tighter. Blue gave up on his screeching. Spear steeled himself. Blue\u2019s struggles weakened. He went limp. Spear held him only a second longer before his strength gave in.\n\nThey both dropped. Blue to the ground. Spear to his knees. His body ached. His blood roiled. His heart was heavy. His bones rattled. Every part of him begged to sit. To wait. And he listened. Spear in hand, he sat down besides Blue. He was already breathing again, but his eyes were shut.\n\nSpear hoped he dreamed of better times.\n\nA passing wind carried away the smoke and fog. With flames around them, he had nowhere to run. No need to run. Neither rat or bear could reach them. He would rest. And when Blue awoke\u2026\n\nWhat would he be then?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Devil\u2019s eyes burned brighter.

He would not raise his Spear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue\u2019s eyes narrowed. He stepped still closer to Spear. \u201cChiss! Chiss!\u201d His calm and cool voice had grown hoarse, like a landslide. Even his breathing sounds laboured. He raised up his hand, flat like a knife. \u201cChissChiss\u2026 Chiss.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He cut through the air. Spear caught it. It burned his skin immediately. He would not let go. He spun, and dragged Blue with him. His back hit the floor hard. If Blue wished to fight, he would fight. But only that. He would not kill. He would not return Blue\u2019s mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stomped his foot where Blue\u2019s head lay. The stone crumbled beneath as Blue rolled to avoid. Blue flicked his wrist, and shards of molten stone dug into his ankle. Spear quickly patted out the small flame that came with it, but Blue took his chance to get back to his feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes were still focused, but his face had changed. He looked different somehow. Focused, but not on the fight. On something far beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue\u2019s fingers crunched as he snapped them. One of The Demon\u2019s bears, as tall as The Giant, lunged between them. But Spear had fought bigger, killed bigger. It was nothing. He only lashed out because it now kept him from Blue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was Blue who struck first. Blue who shoved his hand through the bear\u2019s back. Blue who pulled free metal innards and organs. And as the bear\u2019s glowing eye faded, he pulled out a glass container of black liquid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He snapped the top of the container off and threw it at Spear. The liquid spilled out in a line before Spear caught the bottle. What was it? A gift? He sniffed it. Ech. Not a drink\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue ran his hand down his arms. A small shower of sparks hit the floor. The line of black ignited. Spear\u2019s eyes widened and he raised his arms to-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kra-BOOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear was blown back in a fiery blast. He hit a stone pillar with a horrid crack. But it was only the pillar that broke, not Spear. That did not mean he was safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He patted out small fires in his hair and his cloth. Blue sneered at him. He leaned down, and dipped his hands into the flame. From his palm, the fire darkened. A bright orange to a dull red. He swept his hand forward, and the fire followed. A wall of flame raced to meet Spear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear leaped up and took cover behind the pillar. Flames spilled out around the sides, pouring still forward and over the edge of the tower. He could hear Blue continuing to send flame after flame his way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pillar was breaking down. The crack Spear had made was deepening. Each impact of flame brought it closer to breaking, toppling down atop Spear or sacrificing him to fire. The pillar was growing warm against his back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear turned and reeled his arm back. He could see Blue about to cast another flame. He punched the pillar. It exploded into a cloud of dust and stone, made all the worse by Blue\u2019s flames and smoking mixing into the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear vanished into the cloud. Blue had fire, but fire was not a hunter. Fire had no eyes to find him, no nose to track him. And in the sudden darkness, even Blue\u2019s senses were dulled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The very flame he carried was his undoing. It led Spear to see him. To hear him murmuring and muttering. The swish of his clothes as he searched. Too slow. Too inexperienced. Spear was already behind him. He lunged, wrapping one arm around Blue\u2019s neck and pressing his fist against his chest. Squeezing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He howled as Blue slammed his elbow into his scar. He burned, he hurt, but he would not let go. Blue and his fire were alike in one way: the need to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue thrashed in his grip. He twisted about like a snake. His skin still singed and smoked and cooked Spear everywhere it touched. But Spear would not let go. He lifted Blue off the floor, his feet kicking uselessly. He wretched and coughed as he fought for air. He tried to call out. \u201cDev- urk\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Spear would not let go. He squeezed tighter. Blue gave up on his screeching. Spear steeled himself. Blue\u2019s struggles weakened. He went limp. Spear held him only a second longer before his strength gave in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They both dropped. Blue to the ground. Spear to his knees. His body ached. His blood roiled. His heart was heavy. His bones rattled. Every part of him begged to sit. To wait. And he listened. Spear in hand, he sat down besides Blue. He was already breathing again, but his eyes were shut.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear hoped he dreamed of better times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A passing wind carried away the smoke and fog. With flames around them, he had nowhere to run. No need to run. Neither rat or bear could reach them. He would rest. And when Blue awoke\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What would he be then?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10uomcg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/j7d18vg/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/", "name": "t1_j7d18vg", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675634618.0, "created_utc": 1675634618.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Character Scramble 16 GRAND FINALS: World Is Yours", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "link_author": "OddDirective", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7d17em", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "7thSonOfSons", "num_comments": 45, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7d12zv", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_g4m6x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Spear was aiming his Spear at The Devil. He didn\u2019t know how. Or when. It happened on its own. Even seeing its eye open sent waves of terror through Spear\u2019s body. It acted on its own. The need to stab and scream and tear and fight so deeply carved into him that his body reacted despite his brain.\n\nBlue lowered his hand. His eyes focused on the point of Spear\u2019s Spear. He looked at his fingers. He looked at Spear. His contempt was now buried beneath a look of understanding.\n\n\u201cChiss.\u201d He stretched his arm out to The Devil and closed his hand into a fist. \u201cChissChiss!\u201d\n\nThe Devil did not move. Its eyes widened, like two suns. And Blue screamed.\n\nThe red in eyes poured down his boy, coursing through his veins like a spreading fire. Lines Spear could see even through Blue\u2019s clothes. His fists, clenched so tightly in pain, blackened and hardened. His fingers pressed so tightly into his palms that the spreading fire dripped out onto the floor.\n\nHe lashed out, knocking Spear\u2019s weapon aside. Spear let him. Blue was in pain. It was clear as day. Flailing out in a panic, Spear knew the feeling. He\u2019d seen it too many times before. He\u2019d lived it.\n\nBlue reached out with a blackened hand and dragged it down Spear\u2019s chest. Spear barely felt it. A thin red line formed in the wake of Blue\u2019s touch. It was Spear\u2019s blood.\n\nSpear reached out to him. Blue looked in agony. A cat with one leg in a trap. He needed someone to pull him free-\n\nBut like a cornered beast, Blue did not make it easy. He ducked beneath Spear\u2019s arm. Fast. He had gotten faster? Blue slammed his foot down and swung all of his weight into one elbow. An elbow that smashed into Spear\u2019s chest. A wave of pain rippled out through Spear\u2019s bones.\n\nHe gasped for a breath. Blue. Why was he fighting so hard? Why did he lash out? But Spear knew it. He\u2019d seen it. He\u2019d lived it. Not the wild flailing of pain, but the ferociousness of fear.  A fear of losing everything. Did he not understand? Spear was here! He would never lose!\n\nSpear reached out and wrapped his hand around Blue\u2019s wrist. He\u2019d seen this move before. Other Girl used it to restrain Moustache. He held on to Blue\u2019s charred wrist, and with one great step around him, brought it up between his shoulder blades. Blue hissed out in pain, swinging back with his other elbow. Spear caught it, and kept both his hands behind him. They would wait out the pain together.\n\nHe could see Fang. She was bleeding. A long cut ran along her side, from the top of her leg up to her shoulder. It didn\u2019t slow her. She whipped her body around, and her tail caught Girl in the stomach.\n\nGirl. She was fighting harder than Spear had ever seen her. That same desperation he\u2019d seen in Blue. That fear. The spike in her hand extended downward. It pierced the ground with three prongs just as Fang\u2019s tail connected. She stayed standing.\n\nThen came The Giant. He was bleeding worst of all. All those cuts from their fight on the sky-ship were opening up. He didn\u2019t care. Spear knew he wouldn\u2019t. He cut through rats and bears, dragging his axes along the ground, shooting up sparks from the stone. She winced back.\n\nThe Giant hooked his axe around Girl\u2019s spike and yanked it out of her grip. It fell behind him, and sloshed into a puddle of blood. \u201cHaha! Hvernig \u00e6tlar l\u00edtil st\u00falka a\u00f0 berjast \u00e1n gaffalsins?\u201d\n\nGirl growled and leaped backwards, at the side of The Demon. She did not stay for long. She lunged right back at The Giant. The blood from her wrist shot out and upward, a haft and a head, a massive hammer.\n\nShe came down on The Giant. He and Fang both tried to move out of her path. She struck only the ground. Spear felt the entire tower shiver and groan beneath Girl\u2019s attack. Rats and bears too close flew through the air, or shattered immediately. The ground shook even as far out as Spear was.\n\nBlue took advantage. Spear couldn\u2019t keep his footing. Blue\u2019s leg shot back and around, sweeping his ankle out from under him. Spear released his hold on Blue to catch himself. Blue turned and snapped his fist down into Spear\u2019s forehead.\n\nBut that wound was closed. Spear had no weaknesses. Blue\u2019s fist crunched on impact with his skull. Flakes of charred black skin fell away. Blue yanked his arm back. He threw a kick at his stomach. He was faster. But not fast enough.\n\nSpear caught Blue\u2019s leg. He yanked him down to his knee before tackling him. Wrapping him up tighter. Protecting him as they bowled through the battle. Rolling across the floor until they hit something sturdier than mere animals.\n\nUntil they hit Girl.\n\n\u201cHuah!?\u201d She looked down at them, a fire in her eyes. Her eyes locked with Spear\u2019s. That haze, that mist, it lessened. Her gaze became a little clearer. Her anger, for an instant, was replaced with something else. Something Spear couldn\u2019t place.\n\nSpear reached out to her. A bear collided with the side of her head and shattered. The fire in her heart lit right back up. She bared her teeth and both she and Spear turned to see where it had come from.\n\n\u201cEkki halda a\u00f0 \u00fe\u00fa s\u00e9rt b\u00fainn me\u00f0 okkur!!\u201d The Giant shouted before throwing a rat. Girl snatched it out of the air and tore its head off with her teeth. With a mouthful of metal she sprinted at The Giant. She raised her hammer up onto her shoulder and swung at The Giant.\n\nThe Giant moved closer. The head of the hammer missed him. Only the haft smashed into his side. His smile turned into gritted teeth, but he stayed up. He yanked Girl by the horns and lifted her off the ground. Girl kicked and tried to bite his arm. He laughed and shook her about.\n\nHe called out to Fang. \u201cG\u00e6ttu a\u00f0 ungum \u00fe\u00ednum, gamla kona!\u201d\n\nThe Giant hurled Girl into the air. Fang raced across the roof towards her. Girl screamed. Fang could tear her apart so easily. She didn\u2019t. She jumped after Girl, even higher than The Giant had thrown her. She caught Girl in her talons, and slammed back down into the tower. Another explosion of animals as she crashed down.\n\nSpear\u2019s eyes widened. But Girl was not a pile of blood beneath Fang\u2019s foot. Fang was clutching onto Girl tightly. As tight as he was holding onto Blue. The grip you keep on something you can\u2019t lose.\n\n\u201cHuh! Oaah!?\u201d Girl squirmed and shouted, writhing beneath Fang. Fang dipped her head down. She sniffed her. Girl wrenched her arm free, and punched Fang in the nose.\n\n\u201cSKRRRRRRRA!\u201d She roared and winced from the strike. She released Girl, stumbling backwards. Girl clammored to her feet. She reached out for Fang.\n\nA blood shield formed around her arm as The Giant charged her. He swung with wild ferocity. An avalanche of metal rained down on Girl. CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! He marched her down, and she weathered the storm. Strike after strike beat against her shield.\n\nHe raised both axes overhead. A massive spike formed out of Girl\u2019s shield. She rammed it into The Giant\u2019s stomach. Blood flowed out of him like a river.\n\nHe smiled. It was what he wanted. The shield was out of the way. He smacked the haft of his axe down atop Girl\u2019s head. She staggered back. The Giant kicked her in the chest. She tumbled end over end and smacked into the far wall.\n\n\u201cKomdu litla stelpa! \u00c9g fann \u00fea\u00f0 varla!\u201d The Giant roared. He was covered in more blood than skin now. He marched across the roof, dragging his axes behind him. \u201cEkki segja m\u00e9r a\u00f0 \u00fe\u00fa sleppir okkur bara til a\u00f0 f\u00e1 rassinn \u00e1 \u00fe\u00e9r!\u201d\n\nGirl smashed her fist into the wall. She left behind a crater. The Giant\u2019s taunting was getting to her. She bared her teeth and barked madly at him. He clanged his axes together in front of him. \u201cSlepptu okkur! Slepptu okkur!\u201d\n\nGirl tore across the roof. She paid no mind to the warring animals around her. She barreled past Eyepatch and Other Girl\u2019s wrestling. Through the exchange of fire between Ocean and Wings. Her focus was entirely on The Giant. The blood from her spike and her hammer and her shield and her wounds swirled and mixed around her. It formed together in her hands as a huge crimson scythe.\n\n\u201cHUAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\u201d\n\nShe dragged her blade across the ground. She cut a blood swath in the tower. She came to a dead stop so close to The Giant. All that speed and weight travelled up her body, into her waist, to her shoulders, twisting and slicing through the air. She swung the scythe at The Giant.\n\nShe did not hit him. Leaped over her well before she lashed out. Instead, she slashed into something else\n\nHer blade pierced Fang\u2019s side.\n\nShe cried out in pain and surprise.\n\nSo did Girl.\n\nThe scythe returned to blood, sloshing onto the floor. Fang\u2019s wound did not seal. A streak of red ran down her body. She stomped one way, and then the other, before crashing down onto the ground. Her eyes shut tight. Her tongue sticking out between her teeth. Not moving.\n\nGirl ran to her. She was breathing heavily. Her hands ran all over Fang\u2019s body. \u201cHa, aah\u2026 Haaah!?\u201d Her shoulders were shaking. Her body was moving quicker. Panicking. Confused. The rage in her breath and her heart was replaced with that something else Spear had seen from her before.\n\nFang opened one eye. She looked down at Girl. She shut her eye.\n\nThe Giant stomped up behind her. She didn\u2019t even notice. He hoisted her up by the scruff of her neck. She flailed and kicked, desperate to reach out for Fang. The Giant sighed.\n\n\u201cMissti miki\u00f0 bl\u00f3\u00f0, er \u00fea\u00f0 ekki? J\u00e6ja, \u00e9g f\u00e9kk n\u00f3g, svo hva\u00f0 um \u00e9g-\u201d\n\nHe pulled her close and bit into Girl\u2019s arm.\n\nGirl\u2019s panic worsened. Something more like an animal. A primal immediate fear. She did as an animal would. She bit back. Her sharp teeth sunk into The Giant\u2019s arm.\n\nHe released his jaw and laughed. It was weak. Slurred. Girl hung from his arm. Her eyes were wide. They were clear. \u201cSvo \u00feetta er hvernig \u00e9g fer \u00fat, ha? \u00dea\u00f0 er betra a\u00f0 \u00feeir f\u00e1i s\u00e9r drykki \u00ed Valh\u00f6ll\u2026\u201d\n\nGirl released him, and fell to her knees on the floor. The Giant\u2019s legs swayed beneath him, and he toppled over.\n\nShe was clutching at her temples, screaming and wailing in agony.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\nIn Spear\u2019s grip, Blue shouted. He called to The Devil.

The grip you keep on something you can\u2019t lose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHuh! Oaah!?\u201d Girl squirmed and shouted, writhing beneath Fang. Fang dipped her head down. She sniffed her. Girl wrenched her arm free, and punched Fang in the nose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSKRRRRRRRA!\u201d She roared and winced from the strike. She released Girl, stumbling backwards. Girl clammored to her feet. She reached out for Fang.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A blood shield formed around her arm as The Giant charged her. He swung with wild ferocity. An avalanche of metal rained down on Girl. CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! He marched her down, and she weathered the storm. Strike after strike beat against her shield.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He raised both axes overhead. A massive spike formed out of Girl\u2019s shield. She rammed it into The Giant\u2019s stomach. Blood flowed out of him like a river.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled. It was what he wanted. The shield was out of the way. He smacked the haft of his axe down atop Girl\u2019s head. She staggered back. The Giant kicked her in the chest. She tumbled end over end and smacked into the far wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cKomdu litla stelpa! \u00c9g fann \u00fea\u00f0 varla!\u201d The Giant roared. He was covered in more blood than skin now. He marched across the roof, dragging his axes behind him. \u201cEkki segja m\u00e9r a\u00f0 \u00fe\u00fa sleppir okkur bara til a\u00f0 f\u00e1 rassinn \u00e1 \u00fe\u00e9r!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Girl smashed her fist into the wall. She left behind a crater. The Giant\u2019s taunting was getting to her. She bared her teeth and barked madly at him. He clanged his axes together in front of him. \u201cSlepptu okkur! Slepptu okkur!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Girl tore across the roof. She paid no mind to the warring animals around her. She barreled past Eyepatch and Other Girl\u2019s wrestling. Through the exchange of fire between Ocean and Wings. Her focus was entirely on The Giant. The blood from her spike and her hammer and her shield and her wounds swirled and mixed around her. It formed together in her hands as a huge crimson scythe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHUAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She dragged her blade across the ground. She cut a blood swath in the tower. She came to a dead stop so close to The Giant. All that speed and weight travelled up her body, into her waist, to her shoulders, twisting and slicing through the air. She swung the scythe at The Giant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did not hit him. Leaped over her well before she lashed out. Instead, she slashed into something else&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her blade pierced Fang\u2019s side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She cried out in pain and surprise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So did Girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The scythe returned to blood, sloshing onto the floor. Fang\u2019s wound did not seal. A streak of red ran down her body. She stomped one way, and then the other, before crashing down onto the ground. Her eyes shut tight. Her tongue sticking out between her teeth. Not moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Girl ran to her. She was breathing heavily. Her hands ran all over Fang\u2019s body. \u201cHa, aah\u2026 Haaah!?\u201d Her shoulders were shaking. Her body was moving quicker. Panicking. Confused. The rage in her breath and her heart was replaced with that something else Spear had seen from her before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fang opened one eye. She looked down at Girl. She shut her eye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant stomped up behind her. She didn\u2019t even notice. He hoisted her up by the scruff of her neck. She flailed and kicked, desperate to reach out for Fang. The Giant sighed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMissti miki\u00f0 bl\u00f3\u00f0, er \u00fea\u00f0 ekki? J\u00e6ja, \u00e9g f\u00e9kk n\u00f3g, svo hva\u00f0 um \u00e9g-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He pulled her close and bit into Girl\u2019s arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Girl\u2019s panic worsened. Something more like an animal. A primal immediate fear. She did as an animal would. She bit back. Her sharp teeth sunk into The Giant\u2019s arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He released his jaw and laughed. It was weak. Slurred. Girl hung from his arm. Her eyes were wide. They were clear. \u201cSvo \u00feetta er hvernig \u00e9g fer \u00fat, ha? \u00dea\u00f0 er betra a\u00f0 \u00feeir f\u00e1i s\u00e9r drykki \u00ed Valh\u00f6ll\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Girl released him, and fell to her knees on the floor. The Giant\u2019s legs swayed beneath him, and he toppled over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was clutching at her temples, screaming and wailing in agony.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wasn\u2019t the only one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Spear\u2019s grip, Blue shouted. He called to The Devil. The Devil listened.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10uomcg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/j7d17em/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/", "name": "t1_j7d17em", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675634600.0, "created_utc": 1675634600.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Character Scramble 16 GRAND FINALS: World Is Yours", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "link_author": "OddDirective", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7d12zv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "7thSonOfSons", "num_comments": 45, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7d11p8", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g4m6x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "He walked across the roof. Bears and rats crashed and tore into each other around him. He ignored them. Mere animals. Let them fight, he had his goal. He waded through their battle, until he was closer to Blue. Close enough he couldn\u2019t be ignored.\n\n\nBlue looked at him. He took in a slow deep breath through his nose. That same look of contempt hadn\u2019t left him. His eyes swept over Spear. Especially the wide scar running down his chest. He sighed. \u201cChissChissChiss. Chiss?\u201d\n\nSpear swatted away a bear leaping for his throat. \u201cHoo!\u201d He pointed at himself. \u201cUuh ho!\u201d\n\nBlue walked forward slowly. He brought his hands in front of him. Tugging at his sleeves. Spear was ready for him. Whatever came next, whatever Blue wanted, he would manage. He wasn\u2019t leaving without him.\n\nHe reached out to Blue. Blue grabbed his wrist and twisted his body and made to flip Spear over him. Just as he\u2019d done plenty of times before.\n\nBut Spear didn\u2019t budge. Not even a little. His feet stayed firmly on the ground. Blue tugged and grunted and tried a second time, but nothing came of it. Spear stood tall.\n\nBlue twisted his wrist. It did not snap.\n\nHe spun around and smashed his elbow into Spear\u2019s jaw. He wasn\u2019t even staggered.\n\nSpear was stronger now. Stronger than anyone. Whatever had happened, however he had changed, Spear was not the same. Not the same as the Spear Blue had beaten. And now they both knew it.\n\nBlue rubbed his elbow. He was on edge. His eyes flickered between Spear\u2019s limbs. He was waiting for Spear to strike him back. A strike that would never come. Spear wasn\u2019t here for revenge. He was here to rebuild his pack.\n\nBlue didn\u2019t get it. His eyes flared with anger. He attacked Spear again. Punches to the chest, strikes to his joints, twisting and yanking his limbs this way and that. Nothing would make Spear budge or lash out. He would let Blue work out his anger. And then he would understand. \n\nSpear was stronger. Spear could protect him. Could fight for him. Hunt for him. They were a pack. A family. They were stronger together.\n\nAs Blue continued trying and trying again to find a weakness in Spear\u2019s new body, Spear let him. His attention was pulled elsewhere.\n\nMoustache and Wings. The weakest of his pack. He had left them with Eyepatch. In the middle of the war between the rats and bears, Moustache looked as happy as Spear had ever seen him. He was commanding the rats. Directing them with shouts and barks and sweeps of his hand. Each one sent a surge of rats where he needed them. He was safe. For now.\n\nWings and Eyepatch were less so. They were both tangled up in a fight with Other Girl and The Demon. They were both shooting their weapons at The Demon. Other Girl weaved one way or the other, absorbing their attacks like Spear was absorbing Blue\u2019s. She was undeniably strong.\n\nAnd she was protecting someone. Protecting The Demon.\n\nThe Demon laughed and waved two fingers through the air. \u201cAw hell, you guys can\u2019t shoot for shit! Dumbasses probably couldn\u2019t even kill yourself right! Feel free to prove me wrong!\u201d\n\n\u201cI could kill myself just fine!\u201d Wings shouted. He was flying above the battle. Another shot. It pinged harmlessly off Other Girl\u2019s fist.\n\nEyepatch turned and threw his weapon at Wings. \u201cCover me. I\u2019m going close.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye aye s- WHOA!\u201d Wings fumbled the huge weapon. It dragged him down. Bears swiped at his ankles before he managed to pull himself back up. His tiny wings were doing their best.\n\nEyepatch darted forward. He smashed his fists through several small bears before pouncing at The Demon. He swiped forward with his claws. Other Girl caught him by the collar and easily held him off the ground.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a louse, Mr. Hob. Please keep your paws to yourself.\u201d\n\nEyepatch snarled. He swung his arm out and slashed across Other Girl\u2019s arm. Sparks showered down. She dropped him. He landed on his feet and sprung for The Demon again. She snorted a laugh and snapped her fingers.\n\n**WHAM**\n\nA giant bear\u2019s fist collided with Eyepatch. It slammed down on his back and pressed him into the floor. It squeezed him. He grit his teeth and clawed away at the floor, trying to pull himself free.\n\n**BRATATATATATA**\n\nWings attacked the bear with that massive weapon. More sparks and oil sprayed out as he shot a line up the bear\u2019s body. Moustache\u2019s rats swarmed it, slamming into the thing with their huge heads, until it toppled backwards. Eyepatch was free. He wiped blood from his mouth.\n\nOther Girl looked as cold as ever. \u201cWhat was that now, Mr. Hob, your sixth or seventh life?\u201d\n\n\u201c21. Light \u2018em up!\u201d\n\nAnother spray of weapon fire. Other Girl put herself between Wings and The Demon. His attacks couldn\u2019t pierce her. But they did push her back. They did keep her still. Eyepatch lunged for her this time. His claws were pointed directly at her throat. He bared his te\n\n**BANG!**\n\nEyepatch rolled onto one side. His stomach was bleeding. He clutched a sudden wound with his hand. Other Girl turned towar\n\n**BANG!**\n\nA metal ball smashed into her forehead and knocked her backwards into The Demon\u2019s waiting arms. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you felt that way, Door. I\u2019da bought some flowers.\u201d\n\nSpear turned to the source of the attacks. Swaggering out from the doorway, a weapon in each hand, and who knows how many more in his clothes. A familiar smell like dead fish and salty air.\n\n\u201cI got one for each of ya bastards. And don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten even one of ya.\u201d\n\nIt was Ocean. He\u2019d survived the crash too. He aimed at Wings. \u201c\u2018Specially this rat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a rat!\u201d *Rata* *Tata*. Two bursts. Each pinged off Ocean\u2019s weapons and knocked them out of his hands, into the swarm of warring rats and bears. \u201cI\u2019m a goddamn butterfly!\u201d\n\nOcean scoffed. The swords near his wrists sprung to life. \u201cA rat with wings is still a rat, dyn marw.\u201d\n\nHe charged across the battlefield, stepping on the heads of rats and bears like rocks at the beach. He pulled back his arm. He leaped at Wings and-\n\n**PYEW**\n\nSpear\u2019s attention snapped down. Back to Blue. Back to his fight. To his chest.\n\nHe had been shot.\n\nBut he had not been pierced.\n\nHis skin singed and burnt. He smelled burnt hair. It hurt. His skin hurt. His chest hurt. But his heart hurt. Blue\u2026 shot him.\n\nSpear snorted a hot breath. In a flash, faster than he expected, he snatched Blue\u2019s weapon from him. He smashed it to scraps in his hand. \u201cUraaaaaagh!\u201d\n\nBlue looked surprised. He looked down at his empty hand. Spear had gotten faster since last time too. Faster than Blue. He had to understand that. He had to know Spear was greater now. He was better. He wasn\u2019t mad. Blue didn\u2019t need to be afraid of him.\n\nSpear moved closer. Blue moved away. But Spear was faster. Faster than Blue.\n\nOnly a few steps and they were at arms length. Close enough to touch. Close enough for Spear to show him. Show Blue they were okay. He reached a hand out towards Blue. Blue tried to swat him away. The difference in strength showed. Spear\u2019s hand went only where he wanted it.\n\nHe flicked Blue on the forehead. Punishment for acting out. A way to tell him to think. To look. To listen. How he might educate a child.\n\nBlue staggered backwards. He clutched his forehead and grit his teeth. He dug in his heels. He was in pain. Pain like Spear hadn\u2019t seen from. Spear knew how strong he was. He got it now. He only needed a small display to prove it. One flick. That would show him. Show that Blue needed Spear.\n\nBlue didn\u2019t get the idea. He stomped his foot and sucked in a breath.\n\n\u201cDevil!\u201d\n\nBehind him, from his throne, he awoke.

How he might educate a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue staggered backwards. He clutched his forehead and grit his teeth. He dug in his heels. He was in pain. Pain like Spear hadn\u2019t seen from. Spear knew how strong he was. He got it now. He only needed a small display to prove it. One flick. That would show him. Show that Blue needed Spear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue didn\u2019t get the idea.

But where there was not grey, there was black.\n\nThere, past the columns and decayed walls, so far away and yet not nearly far enough. Seated, simply and perfectly, at the other end of the tower\u2019s roof. A beast. A beast whose name was engraved in every step, every breath, every heartbeat Spear had ever taken. A black nothing, a black death, in the shape of a man, but far more vast. The Devil.\n\nIts eyes were shut. Its gaze was nowhere. It slept?\n\nMoustache seemed to think so as well.

Even those beasts below, those pretenders to your throne, could not stop me! So come now, come, let\u2019s make a deal. Give me the world, and I\u2019ll return it back tenfold!\u201d\n\nMoustache\u2019s words, so confident and so loud, quickly vanished into silence. Eyepatch snarled and raised his weapon at Moustache. Wings zipped to his side, and pushed the end down. Slowly. The Giant drew his axes..\n\nAnd Moustache. Moustache stood before The Devil. Still as a corpse. But as the seconds passed, he hesitated. His fingers curled in. His arms lowered. He looked about, confused. But when he opened his mouth to speak, he was cut off by a sound like hideous laughter.\n\n\u201cHehehe\u2026 AhaaaaahahaHAHAHAHA!\u201d\n\nDemon. No other image in Spear\u2019s head matched such a wicked noise. A hateful laugh, like a pack of Hyenas finding a limping calf. The hairs on his arm stood up. His spine felt cold.\n\nThe Demon emerged from The Devil\u2019s shadow. It strutted forward like a bird, long slow steps. It almost looked like a girl, but Spear would not be tricked. Her eyes. The mist of cruelty and insanity that swam through them. As well as how they picked apart each member of his pack like meat to be carved.\n\nEyepatch turned his weapon on Demon. \u201cAnd just what\u2019s so funny, girly?\u201d\n\nThat sent The Demon into another giggling fit.. \u201c\u5197\u8ac7\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u3053\u308c\u306f\u3059\u3079\u3066\u30d2\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u3059\uff01\u201d\n\nEyepatch glanced at Wings. \u201cOh, uhh, she said- uhm\u2026 Watashi o, which me-\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, eh!?\u201d The Demon looked them over. She wiped tears from eyes and flicked them off to the floor. \u201cReally? I thought you were big in tech, Stockman, you don\u2019t know Japanese? Wow, that makes this even funnier. Honestly I\u2019ve gone through this whole thing in my head, like, thirty thousand times, and it never once occurred to me you\u2019d be too dumb to even jump the language barrier. But, like, you didn\u2019t even notice your little dream plan getting snatched from under you so it\u2019s not that much of a stretch, huh?\u201d She motioned towards Spear and The Giant. \u201cYou guys get it, right?\u201d\n\nThe Giant looked as confused as Spear. Moustache scowled. \u201cAnd just who in God\u2019s nam-\u201d\n\n\u201cCast not the name of God, ye who are guilty.\u201d Other Girl clutched Moustache\u2019s shoulder. So tightly his shout shrivelled up and died in his throat. \u201cYou stand before my master, and you shall respect her.\u201d\n\nEyepatch whirled around to point his gun at her. Other Girl grabbed Moustache\u2019s wrist and yanked it up between his shoulders, putting him between her and Eyepatch.\n\nThe Demon waved her hand about. \u201cOh Dorothy, didn\u2019t I teach you manners? There\u2019s no need to be rough with the guy. He didn\u2019t know! He never knew anything! I actually can\u2019t freakin\u2019 believe it.\u201d\n\nOther Girl shoved Moustache into Eyepatch, and calmly stepped backwards to join The Demon\u2019s side.\n\nMoustache tore himself from Eyepatch. His eyes bulged with anger as he shouted. \u201cMaster? MASTER? I think some screws are loose in your head, slave maid. That teenage bitch is nobody\u2019s master. Devil! I know you can hear me! I can deliver you an entire army, if you\u2019d only smite this horrible girl here and now!\u201d\n\nThe Demon cackled once more. But she was not alone. Her joy was echoed a hundred times more. \u201cPuhuhuhu~.\u201d\n\nBears climbed up and over the edge of the tower. Most small, some as big as Fang, all black and white with claws like iron. All laughing that irritating laugh.\n\nThe Demon pouted. \u201cSooooowwy~. We got an army already. O Stockman, my Stockman, I can see those gears grinding in your head. You still don\u2019t get it?\u201d\n\nShe kept yapping at Moustache. Spear was more focused on the army of Bears. He stood back to back with The Giant, him clutching his axe and Spear hoisting his Spear. Wings and Eyepatch were doing the same.\n\nFang had tried to eat one already, but she hated it, given how she screeched and wretched.\n\nThe Giant was getting that look again. \u201cSeg\u00f0u or\u00f0i\u00f0 stj\u00f3ri. Vi\u00f0 skulum drepa \u00fe\u00e1!\u201d\n\nMoustache was too engrossed in The Demon, Spear wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d noticed the Bears. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re dead. I don\u2019t know who you are or how you followed me, but-\u201d\n\n\u201cStupid. Stupid. Sooooo stupid!\u201d The Demon shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not here cuz of you. You\u2019re here cuz of me! You\u2019re just a little distraction, a rat in the cogs to crash the sibs party downstairs with our ace in the hole. The only reason your dumbass is still alive is so I could see the look on your face when you realised!!\u201d\n\nMoustache stepped backwards. \u201cI- That can\u2019t-\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, me, me, that\u2019s all you talk about.\u201d The Demon yawned. \u201cLook Stockman, I\u2019ll spell it out for ya. A thousand years from now The Devil here, he found *me*. He chose *me*. Not you, me. And if he did that, that means he will do that, and if he will do that, then he won\u2019t do not that. Get it? You never had a chance! I win now so that I can win later, and you lose, and you lose, and you! LOSE!\u201d\n\nShe squealed another bout of laughter. Moustache's anger boiled over, so furious he became calm all over again. He pulled something from his clothes. A little metal box. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s how this works, if you think I\u2019d ever lose to a child, I have bad news. You\u2019re not the only one with backup.\u201d\n\nThe Demon paused. And she smiled. \u201cWooooow, you guys are tough. I mean really, round of applause, I thought at least the bumble bee guy would have cracked already. But lemme ask ya something, Bax. You think this army of ours doesn\u2019t have a general?\u201d\n\nShe jerked her thumb back into the shadows.\n\nA girl stepped out. No. Girl stepped out. She was shaking. Her eyes constantly flicked to The Demon. \u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Blood slid down her wrist and formed a spike in her hand.\n\nFrom behind her, as confident and as in control as always, another stepped forward.\n\nIt was him.

See how easily Baxter Stockman has turned the challenges and setbacks of this world aside to reach you. At the top of a tower, at the bottom of the world, and still I\u2019ve found you. Even those beasts below, those pretenders to your throne, could not stop me! So come now, come, let\u2019s make a deal. Give me the world, and I\u2019ll return it back tenfold!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache\u2019s words, so confident and so loud, quickly vanished into silence. Eyepatch snarled and raised his weapon at Moustache. Wings zipped to his side, and pushed the end down. Slowly. The Giant drew his axes..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And Moustache. Moustache stood before The Devil. Still as a corpse. But as the seconds passed, he hesitated. His fingers curled in. His arms lowered. He looked about, confused. But when he opened his mouth to speak, he was cut off by a sound like hideous laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHehehe\u2026 AhaaaaahahaHAHAHAHA!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Demon. No other image in Spear\u2019s head matched such a wicked noise. A hateful laugh, like a pack of Hyenas finding a limping calf. The hairs on his arm stood up. His spine felt cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon emerged from The Devil\u2019s shadow. It strutted forward like a bird, long slow steps. It almost looked like a girl, but Spear would not be tricked. Her eyes. The mist of cruelty and insanity that swam through them. As well as how they picked apart each member of his pack like meat to be carved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch turned his weapon on Demon. \u201cAnd just what\u2019s so funny, girly?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That sent The Demon into another giggling fit.. \u201c\u5197\u8ac7\u3067\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u3053\u308c\u306f\u3059\u3079\u3066\u30d2\u30b9\u30c6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3067\u3059\uff01\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch glanced at Wings. \u201cOh, uhh, she said- uhm\u2026 Watashi o, which me-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cEh, eh!?\u201d The Demon looked them over. She wiped tears from eyes and flicked them off to the floor. \u201cReally? I thought you were big in tech, Stockman, you don\u2019t know Japanese? Wow, that makes this even funnier. Honestly I\u2019ve gone through this whole thing in my head, like, thirty thousand times, and it never once occurred to me you\u2019d be too dumb to even jump the language barrier. But, like, you didn\u2019t even notice your little dream plan getting snatched from under you so it\u2019s not that much of a stretch, huh?\u201d She motioned towards Spear and The Giant. \u201cYou guys get it, right?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant looked as confused as Spear. Moustache scowled. \u201cAnd just who in God\u2019s nam-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cCast not the name of God, ye who are guilty.\u201d Other Girl clutched Moustache\u2019s shoulder. So tightly his shout shrivelled up and died in his throat. \u201cYou stand before my master, and you shall respect her.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch whirled around to point his gun at her. Other Girl grabbed Moustache\u2019s wrist and yanked it up between his shoulders, putting him between her and Eyepatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon waved her hand about. \u201cOh Dorothy, didn\u2019t I teach you manners? There\u2019s no need to be rough with the guy. He didn\u2019t know! He never knew anything! I actually can\u2019t freakin\u2019 believe it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other Girl shoved Moustache into Eyepatch, and calmly stepped backwards to join The Demon\u2019s side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache tore himself from Eyepatch. His eyes bulged with anger as he shouted. \u201cMaster? MASTER? I think some screws are loose in your head, slave maid. That teenage bitch is nobody\u2019s master. Devil! I know you can hear me! I can deliver you an entire army, if you\u2019d only smite this horrible girl here and now!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon cackled once more. But she was not alone. Her joy was echoed a hundred times more. \u201cPuhuhuhu~.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bears climbed up and over the edge of the tower. Most small, some as big as Fang, all black and white with claws like iron. All laughing that irritating laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon pouted. \u201cSooooowwy~. We got an army already. O Stockman, my Stockman, I can see those gears grinding in your head. You still don\u2019t get it?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She kept yapping at Moustache. Spear was more focused on the army of Bears. He stood back to back with The Giant, him clutching his axe and Spear hoisting his Spear. Wings and Eyepatch were doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fang had tried to eat one already, but she hated it, given how she screeched and wretched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant was getting that look again. \u201cSeg\u00f0u or\u00f0i\u00f0 stj\u00f3ri. Vi\u00f0 skulum drepa \u00fe\u00e1!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache was too engrossed in The Demon, Spear wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d noticed the Bears. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re dead. I don\u2019t know who you are or how you followed me, but-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cStupid. Stupid. Sooooo stupid!\u201d The Demon shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not here cuz of you. You\u2019re here cuz of me! You\u2019re just a little distraction, a rat in the cogs to crash the sibs party downstairs with our ace in the hole. The only reason your dumbass is still alive is so I could see the look on your face when you realised!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache stepped backwards. \u201cI- That can\u2019t-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cMe, me, me, that\u2019s all you talk about.\u201d The Demon yawned. \u201cLook Stockman, I\u2019ll spell it out for ya. A thousand years from now The Devil here, he found &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. He chose &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Not you, me. And if he did that, that means he will do that, and if he will do that, then he won\u2019t do not that. Get it? You never had a chance! I win now so that I can win later, and you lose, and you lose, and you! LOSE!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She squealed another bout of laughter. Moustache&amp;#39;s anger boiled over, so furious he became calm all over again. He pulled something from his clothes. A little metal box. \u201cIf you think that\u2019s how this works, if you think I\u2019d ever lose to a child, I have bad news. You\u2019re not the only one with backup.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Demon paused. And she smiled. \u201cWooooow, you guys are tough. I mean really, round of applause, I thought at least the bumble bee guy would have cracked already. But lemme ask ya something, Bax. You think this army of ours doesn\u2019t have a general?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She jerked her thumb back into the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A girl stepped out. No. Girl stepped out. She was shaking. Her eyes constantly flicked to The Demon. \u201cHaa\u2026\u201d Blood slid down her wrist and formed a spike in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From behind her, as confident and as in control as always, another stepped forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was him. It was Blue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10uomcg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/j7d0z2y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/", "name": "t1_j7d0z2y", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675634501.0, "created_utc": 1675634501.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Character Scramble 16 GRAND FINALS: World Is Yours", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "link_author": "OddDirective", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7d0xbx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "7thSonOfSons", "num_comments": 45, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7d0mnq", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g4m6x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "As it always did, the sun overtook the darkness.

Or maybe it didn\u2019t matter if he did. He had crushed Bear, and two more Bears had come. How many Bears were there? And did Spear really have to crush them, weak and pathetic as they were?\n\nMoustache seemed to think so. He snapped his fingers, calling for The Giant\u2019s attention. \u201cThorkell, kill them. You enjoy that sort of thing, right?\u201d\n\nThe Bears clutched one another, their knees shaking. One of them raised up a fluffy white paw in terror. Other Girl stepped forward. She put herself between them and the Bears. Her flat, void expression swept across them before settling on Moustache.\n\n\u201cStockman, I thought you were a scientist. A businessman. Are you really so cruel as to inflict violence and death upon things that merely annoy you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Moustache grumbled. \u201cNow especially, when I am so close to being more than a mere scientist or businessman. Once we reach your master, I\u2019ll have these automatons wiped out anyway. So what point is there in letting them run about?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my master did not wish them to be, they would not be.\u201d\n\nMoustache flinched away from her. Eyepatch stepped forward. \u201cHey, c\u2019mon, what\u2019s wrong with the little guys, Doc? They\u2019re kinda creepy and annoying, but hey, you got that in common!\u201d\n\nThe bears had ceased holding onto one another and instead clung to Other Girls legs. Moustache took a deep breath. He clapped his hands together before dragging them down his face. His expression softened. Neutral. But Spear knew him well enough to know that could change in an instant.\n\nMoustache looked down at the Bears. \u201cElevator pitch. Ten words or less. Why should I let you live?\u201d\n\nBears looked at one another. They nodded their heads in a slow rhythm before one of them chirped up. \u201cWe. Can. Take. You. Where. You. Want. To. Go\u2026 Stupid!\u201d\n\nMoustaches expression darkened. He glared down on Bears. \u201cAnd you think I require your help? I can climb this tower myself. Thorkell-\u201d\n\nOther Girl picked up one of Bears. The other Bear climbed up her leg and clung to her back. \u201cWe *were* climbing the tower, Doctor. And then we crashed. If these creatures can lead us to my master, they are our allies.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, uhh, sorry for telling Tusker to smoosh our ally then.\u201d Wings looked down at Bear\u2019s remains. \u201cSome stuff just got lost in translation. Y\u2019know, a little friendly fire between pals.\u201d\n\nSpear looked to Fang. Her eyes hadn\u2019t left Bears since they\u2019d emerged. But she hadn\u2019t attacked them. Yet. If she thought they were dangerous, she would have killed them already. Spear felt much the same way. Bears were not the enemy.\n\nThe Giant shook Spear\u2019s shoulder. Spear looked back at him. He pointed up. \u201c\u00c9g held a\u00f0 t\u00fdndir vinir okkar s\u00e9u \u00fearna uppi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoo.\u201d Up. They needed to go Up. Blue had been pulled Up. If they wanted Blue and Girl back into their pack, they had to go Up. Spear reached out and tugged at Moustache\u2019s sleeve.\n\nMoustache whirled around to face him. His eyes were bulging, his expression was one of boiling anger and frustration.\n\nSpear gave him a thumbs up. \u201cOoh.\u201d\n\nMoustache\u2019s bad mood did not shore up all at once. But he shut his eyes. He breathed in. He dragged his fingers along the shape of his face. He shook his head, shook out his shoulders. He calmed himself. And he breathed out.\n\n\u201c... Fine. It\u2019s fine. Really all of this is fine. A distraction. A mere stepping stone in our path. Whether it\u2019s the bears or myself that leads us, I don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t matter. Miss Wanyewright, if this is truly the means to meet with your master, then let's be off.\u201d\n\nOther Girl turned away. Bears grumbled and mumbled something. She nodded. \u201cOf course, Doctor. Right this way everyone.\u201d\n\nShe walked into the shadow of the sky-ship wreck. The others followed her. Spear motioned for Fang to join them. \u201cHoo ooh, oh.\u201d\n\nShe snorted, and she stood, and she walked besides Spear.\n\nThey worked their way around- or in Fang\u2019s case, through- the shattered bits of the sky-ship. Back towards the hole in the wall Spear had made when he crashed it. Outside, the sea had calmed. The sky was quiet. Not a crashing wave or twinkling star in sight. It was a lonely tower.\n\nThey also found a door. Other Girl motioned to Spear. He obliged by kicking it open. It was painfully noisy, both Wings and Moustache shielded their ears. But what lay beyond was perfect. As good as when they\u2019d found heaps of food their first time in the tower.\n\nA wide, massive stairwell. Wider than even the largest trees he\u2019d climbed in his home. One that wound up and up and up into darkness. One that would lead them to Blue and to Girl. Other Girl nodded her thanks, and pressed onward.\n\nThe climb was oddly quiet. Spear\u2019s footsteps were so soft he could barely hear them. Frequently he would look over his shoulder just to ensure his pack was still together. The torch light was sparse, far between, meaning they often walked in total darkness. Spear kept one hand on the smooth cold stone wall to keep sense of himself. The other hand he kept tightly clutching his Spear.\n\nSome time into their climb, Spear could not tell how long, or how far, one of Bears peaked its head back to look at them. Spear was thankful for its one glowing red eye, or he may have missed it. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the story, morning glory? Guys night out get crashed? Mass ritual suicide you regret? Something in between?\u201d\n\nIts whistling and chirping sounded so distant. It reminded Spear of the grey mist. Of how cold and lonely that place and that cave were. But he was thankful it swallowed up Bears\u2019 cries as it did. Its tone was like bees in his ears.\n\nMoustache snorted. \u201cWhat does it matter why we\u2019re here? We\u2019re here, and we have something to do here, that\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, how can I help you? You wouldn\u2019t seriously let *me* lead you without knowing why I\u2019m leading you, right? If I got the wrong idea, I might just- just-\u201d Its red eye glowed more intensely. \u201cDo something horrible~.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to help the big guy get his kid back!\u201d Wings was shouting. He must have noticed the same as Spear. Being near the back of the pack, it was still hard to make out his whines.\n\n\u201cAnd then we\u2019re taking the good doctor here back home.\u201d Eyepatch this time. He was close to Moustache. Keeping guard or keeping an eye on him, Spear wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cMaybe have a word with that blue asshole that tried to off a friend of ours. Some New York style diplomacy.\u201d\n\nBear\u2019s gaze swept over Spear. It snorted. Spear hated the sound. \u201cThis is the big guy?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor you,\u201d Wings shouted.\n\nBear turned its head away. \u201cPuhuhu, don\u2019t you worry about little ol\u2019 me, I\u2019ve seen way bigger guys. I\u2019ll even introduce ya!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's enough.\u201d Other Girl\u2019s hand rested atop Bear\u2019s head. \u201cYou are supposed to be leading us. Please continue to do so and cease speaking. I cannot stand your voice. No offence intended.\u201d\n\nWhatever Other Girl had done, her touch had lulled Bears back into silence. It was just Spear, his pack, and the endless march into darkness.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moustache stared at the scene. His thumb slid across his face, wiping away Bear\u2019s black blood. He rubbed his finger against his thumb, and looked closely at the blood. Before reaching out and wiping his hand clean on Spear\u2019s shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell, that\u2019s settled. Excellent work, savage. I\u2019ve really had enough of the \u2018whimsy\u2019 of this era. If I had to hear that robot rattle on any longer I may have turned to violence myself.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache nodded at Spear. Other Girl reached out and tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cDoctor, you may wish to avert your ears.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat have you-\u201d Moustache turned to face her. His good mood vanished immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cBeary scary friend you\u2019ve got, Doctor.\u201d Bear walked out of the shadows. Spear looked behind him. No, there was Bear. In pieces. But when he turned back, Bear was already joined with a second Bear! Or\u2026 a third?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWith friends like those, who needs enemies? Puhuhuhu~,\u201d Bear squeaked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear readied his weapon. He had seen this trick before. They were like Metal, many of the same beast repeated again and again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked to Wings for assistance. He only shrugged, helpless. Did he not understand? Or maybe it didn\u2019t matter if he did. He had crushed Bear, and two more Bears had come. How many Bears were there? And did Spear really have to crush them, weak and pathetic as they were?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache seemed to think so.

His body ached. He pounded the floor and pushed himself up. What new monster tittered away now?\n\nA bear. A small bear. Maybe just a cub. It was half black, half white, with one wicked red eye. And it was smiling at him. A smile, but it was not alive. It did not breathe. Like Other Girl or Metal or The Bird.\n\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon. That was gold! Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t discovered comedy yet? You some kind of bar*bear*ian~?\u201d\n\nSpear exhaled. He reached his hand out, and rested it on top of the bear\u2019s head. Slowly, cautiously. But he did it. He pet the creature. He *could* control himself. It was good. Proof to himself that he was not so far gone.\n\nNow calmed, he pressed his ear to the ground and listened. He had made a mistake. That meant he had to fix it. As well as he could. He heard the low thumping of The Giant\u2019s heart, and the steady rhythm of Fang\u2019s breathing, and more beyond that.\n\nHe turned towards the wreck of the sky-ship. His strength had caused this, but his strength would fix this. He would use it to protect, and to save. It was his role in the pack.\n\nHe rushed over to the ship and knocked on the wood. \u201cOoh-hoo?\u201d\n\nAfter a second, he heard a call back. \u201cIs that you, savage? God\u2019s greatest challenge. Listen, don\u2019t do anything rash, I can get us out of here-\u201d\n\nSpear nodded and followed the sound of the voice. Just a few steps further down the wreckage. He pulled his arm back and smashed his fist through the remains of a wall. He gripped the hole he\u2019d made and yanked the wall away as easily as picking fruit from a tree.\n\nThe firelight of the tower flooded into the sky-ship's carcass. It didn\u2019t just show Moustache, but much of his pack at once. The Giant winced and turned his face away for a moment. But when he saw Spear, he barked a single laugh. \u201c\u00dearna er okkar ma\u00f0ur.\u201d\n\nHe crawled out through the hole and popped the bones in his back. Wings and Moustache clamoured out after. Eyepatch waved out Other Girl, and followed behind. He carried several metal tubes- weapons- under his arms, jangling as he walked into the cave. He stopped next to Spear.\n\nSpear looked away. But Eyepatch sighed quietly and put his hand on Spear\u2019s shoulder. The same way The Giant would. \u201cLook uhh\u2026 Tusker, don\u2019t worry about it. If I had a nickel for every new mutanimal what didn\u2019t know his own strength, I\u2019d be richer than Stockman. Just be careful. Hell, I still got nine lives in me, but your friends probably got a lot less.\u201d\n\nMoustache brushed the dirt off his clothes. \u201cHe can\u2019t understand you.\u201d\n\nEyepatch looked at Spear. \u201c... No, no I think he does. You just wouldn\u2019t get it, Doc.\u201d\n\nEyepatch held up a thumbs up. Spear knew that one. He returned the gesture. This seemed to upset Moustache. But what didn\u2019t?\n\nThe Giant raised a thumbs up of his own. \u201cJ\u00e6ja ef allir eru \u00ed lagi, af hverju h\u00f6ldum vi\u00f0 ekki \u00e1fram-\u201d\n\nA small rumbling built. A wretched peeling and crunching echoed through the room. And then Spear\u2019s scaly snout smashed through the wooden ship. She sniffed and snorted wildly. Spear rushed to the wall that hid her, and tore it away, Spear squeezed through the hole and shook off flakes and splinters. Then her eyes narrowed, and she huffed a hot breath while leaning down to eye level with the little bear that had greeted Spear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember this little beastie last time we were here.\u201d Moustache walked at Fang\u2019s side. \u201cThis someone\u2019s pet? It\u2019s certainly ugly enough to fit in\u2026\u201d\n\nThe bear waved its fists. \u201cUgly am I? Why don\u2019t you come over here and say that, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, wonderful. It speaks. How curious I suddenly wish that trait were rarer.\u201d Moustache rubbed his eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you scurry off to your master, Bear. I\u2019m in no mood to deal with more of this tower's idiotic animal staff.\u201d\n\nBear and Moustache continued grunting at one another. Wings came up between Spear and The Giant. Slowly, cautiously. He raised his hand to hide a finger pointing down at Bear.\n\n\u201cUh, I\u2019m not sure you guys can\u2026 oh man, you\u2019re both really tall. But, you know, that little thing gives me major vibes. Bad ones, I mean. My butterfly senses are going crazy. Not like literally but just, I mean, black and white, that\u2019s villain colours. Cruella de Ville, Venom, the Cenobites, Storm from X-Men, it\u2019s all the same. I don\u2019t trust that thing as far as I can throw it.\u201d\n\nHe was buzzing about excitedly. The Giant shrugged. But Spear raised up his hand, and pointed at Bear behind it.\n\nWings gave him not one, but two thumbs up. \u201cYeah! Yeah, kick his ass!\u201d\n\nSpear returned the thumbs up.\n\nThey stared at one another. Wings eyed up Spear. \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d He raised his palm, and punched it with the other hand.\n\nOh! Spear understood now. Blue would often give him that sign. He wanted Spear to fight. To fight\u2026 Bear? But it was so small. Not like the men and the things Blue would send Spear after.\n\nThen Spear remembered. Wings was not strong. Their fight with Ocean, he only struck once. From out of darkness. He was like a snake. A very small snake, if something like Bear was threatening to him.\n\nSpear nodded. He was strong. The strongest. If his pack needed him to use that strength, he would. Eyepatch had joined up with Moustache, and nodded at Spear. Spear walked slowly towards Bear. Bear looked up at him.\n\n\u201cHey, look who came to join us! Hey, Suckman, can this guy-\u201d\n\nSpear slapped his hand down on Bear\u2019s head. Its body exploded across the floor. But not in blood and meat, it was metal and oil. Bear really was like The Bird\u2026\n\nHe looked back at Wings. Thumbs up. Wings blinked. And then gave a thumbs up back.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spear took in a deep breath. His body ached. He pounded the floor and pushed himself up. What new monster tittered away now?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bear. A small bear. Maybe just a cub. It was half black, half white, with one wicked red eye. And it was smiling at him. A smile, but it was not alive. It did not breathe. Like Other Girl or Metal or The Bird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAw, c\u2019mon. That was gold! Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t discovered comedy yet? You some kind of bar&lt;em&gt;bear&lt;/em&gt;ian~?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear exhaled. He reached his hand out, and rested it on top of the bear\u2019s head. Slowly, cautiously. But he did it. He pet the creature. He &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; control himself. It was good. Proof to himself that he was not so far gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now calmed, he pressed his ear to the ground and listened. He had made a mistake. That meant he had to fix it. As well as he could. He heard the low thumping of The Giant\u2019s heart, and the steady rhythm of Fang\u2019s breathing, and more beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He turned towards the wreck of the sky-ship. His strength had caused this, but his strength would fix this. He would use it to protect, and to save. It was his role in the pack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He rushed over to the ship and knocked on the wood. \u201cOoh-hoo?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a second, he heard a call back. \u201cIs that you, savage? God\u2019s greatest challenge. Listen, don\u2019t do anything rash, I can get us out of here-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear nodded and followed the sound of the voice. Just a few steps further down the wreckage. He pulled his arm back and smashed his fist through the remains of a wall. He gripped the hole he\u2019d made and yanked the wall away as easily as picking fruit from a tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The firelight of the tower flooded into the sky-ship&amp;#39;s carcass. It didn\u2019t just show Moustache, but much of his pack at once. The Giant winced and turned his face away for a moment. But when he saw Spear, he barked a single laugh. \u201c\u00dearna er okkar ma\u00f0ur.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He crawled out through the hole and popped the bones in his back. Wings and Moustache clamoured out after. Eyepatch waved out Other Girl, and followed behind. He carried several metal tubes- weapons- under his arms, jangling as he walked into the cave. He stopped next to Spear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear looked away. But Eyepatch sighed quietly and put his hand on Spear\u2019s shoulder. The same way The Giant would. \u201cLook uhh\u2026 Tusker, don\u2019t worry about it. If I had a nickel for every new mutanimal what didn\u2019t know his own strength, I\u2019d be richer than Stockman. Just be careful. Hell, I still got nine lives in me, but your friends probably got a lot less.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache brushed the dirt off his clothes. \u201cHe can\u2019t understand you.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch looked at Spear. \u201c... No, no I think he does. You just wouldn\u2019t get it, Doc.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch held up a thumbs up. Spear knew that one. He returned the gesture. This seemed to upset Moustache. But what didn\u2019t?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant raised a thumbs up of his own. \u201cJ\u00e6ja ef allir eru \u00ed lagi, af hverju h\u00f6ldum vi\u00f0 ekki \u00e1fram-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A small rumbling built. A wretched peeling and crunching echoed through the room. And then Spear\u2019s scaly snout smashed through the wooden ship. She sniffed and snorted wildly. Spear rushed to the wall that hid her, and tore it away, Spear squeezed through the hole and shook off flakes and splinters. Then her eyes narrowed, and she huffed a hot breath while leaning down to eye level with the little bear that had greeted Spear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI don\u2019t remember this little beastie last time we were here.\u201d Moustache walked at Fang\u2019s side. \u201cThis someone\u2019s pet? It\u2019s certainly ugly enough to fit in\u2026\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bear waved its fists. \u201cUgly am I? Why don\u2019t you come over here and say that, huh?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAh, wonderful. It speaks. How curious I suddenly wish that trait were rarer.\u201d Moustache rubbed his eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you scurry off to your master, Bear. I\u2019m in no mood to deal with more of this tower&amp;#39;s idiotic animal staff.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bear and Moustache continued grunting at one another. Wings came up between Spear and The Giant. Slowly, cautiously. He raised his hand to hide a finger pointing down at Bear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cUh, I\u2019m not sure you guys can\u2026 oh man, you\u2019re both really tall.

Hven\u00e6r brj\u00f3tum vi\u00f0 \u00fat r\u00f3\u00f0urinn?\u201d\n\nWings was kneeling beside The Giant. He had a little white box filled with colourful, foul smelling liquids, strips of cloth, and a small needle and thread. The needle was currently in use, pulling together the skin on one of The Giant\u2019s many wounds. He sucked in a sharp breath through his teeth and wapped Wings\u2019 hand.\n\n\u201cFylgstu me\u00f0 hvar \u00fe\u00fa potar!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Wings yelped. \u201cThis is just, it\u2019s hard, y\u2019know? There\u2019s a lot of\u2026 wind. Just, stop hitting me! I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d He cringed away from The Giant, but his hands kept up their work. The Giant would just have to put up with it.\n\nSpear watched them a second longer. The Giant was as tough as any beast of the land, but he often lost himself when it came time for action. It was good that Wings\u2019 was here. He could not challenge The Giant in strength, so there was no pull for them to fight. He could heal The Giant unafraid. Mostly.\n\nHis gaze moved up the sky-ship. Fang was pressed down to the deck. Her claws dug through the boards each time they tilted a little too far to one side. She wasn\u2019t too happy. But she wasn\u2019t too angry either.\n\nBehind her, Other Girl was at the wheel. She stared blankly ahead. She\u2019d claimed Ocean\u2019s hat for herself, which Spear took to make her master of the sky-ship. The Giant had bellowed and stomped about after she\u2019d taken control, but he had not raised his fist against her. Spear was glad. It wasn\u2019t worth risking more injury for a hat.\n\nSpear followed Other Girl\u2019s gaze. Off the ship, out to the distance. To the tower. It grew larger with every moment, but it felt different than the first time they\u2019d approached. It felt even more important.\n\nBlue and Girl were still inside. They had been left behind. After Blue had\u2026 run away. He had to hunt them both. He had to find them. And take them away. This was no place for them, or for anyone.\n\nHis attention was pulled from the tower back to the sky-ship. Moustache had returned from the ships inside. Clutching a metal skull, he walked up the stairs, followed closely by Eyepatch. They were arguing.\n\nSpear frowned. They were always arguing. Snarling and growling at each other. Spear feared eventually they would get to biting.\n\nEyepatch hissed. \u201cStop walking away from me and talk to me, Bax. We don\u2019t need more of those damn things, but I need to know what you\u2019re cooking. The pirates locked up, why not the girl? I don\u2019t trust that machine further than I can throw her.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me for having more faith in a robot than in you, Hob.\u201d Moustache rolled his eyes. \u201cLast time I entrusted a job to you, I ended up paying for it. Hell, I\u2019m still paying for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect? You were an asshole.\u201d Eyepatch side eyed Other Girl. \u201cLook, just, who is she? What\u2019s the deal? She don\u2019t look like one of yours, and I\u2019m not about to have two of you mad scientists jerking my chain.\u201d\n\nMoustache turned to face him. \u201cShe\u2019s taking us where we need to go. That\u2019s all you need to know. We\u2019re getting back the caveman\u2019s kid, and nothing more. A favour for saving my life, and Max\u2019s too. Unless you\u2019ve seen Miss Wayneright doing something worth distrust, I suggest you keep your prejudices to yourself, and focus on your own.\u201d\n\nEyepatch bared his teeth. Spear leaned forward, ready to throw himself between the two. But the biting didn\u2019t come. Eyepatch barged past Moustache, bumping him hard enough that he dropped his metal skull onto the deck. It rolled across the sky-ship, coming to a stop at Other Girl\u2019s black boot.\n\nShe leaned down and scooped it up. She turned it over in her hand, studying it, before holding her arm out. \u201cYou dropped this.\u201d\n\nMoustache shuffled across the floor and snatched it from her. \u201cEyes forward. Hands on the wheel. Don\u2019t mess this up.\u201d\n\nOther Girl stared at him. Then her eyes raised up to Spear. She motioned him to come closer. He hopped down from the railing and walked to the front of the sky-ship. Other Girl took his wrists, and led his hands onto the wooden wheel. Spear\u2019s eyes widened, and he held onto the wheel as tightly as he dared.\n\n\u201cHey hey hey!\u201d Moustache shouted angrily and tried to wrestle the wheel away from Spear. Spear\u2019s hands stayed locked in place. \u201cWhat the hell is this!?\u201d\n\nOther Girl crossed her arms. \u201cDoctor, we are in the sky. Even this lout can fly the ship. There is nothing to crash into. Do not question my piloting just because I\u2019m a woman.\u201d\n\nMoustache looked enraged. Other Girl took control of the sky-ship from Spear. Eyepatch chuckled as he took a seat opposite The Giant. \u201cMachine\u2019s got jokes.\u201d\n\nSpear ran from the wheel. He didn\u2019t want to ruin things. Not when they were this close. Hunting and killing, those he could do. Controlling Fang, he could try. But controlling the sky-ship? No.\n\nThe Giant laughed as Spear rushed past him. \u201cEngin sk\u00f6mm, vinur. \u00dea\u00f0 eru ekki allir h\u00e6fir til a\u00f0 lei\u00f0a skipi\u00f0.\u201d\n\nWings stepped back and raised his hands. \u201cDone! Damn, you are just one big wound, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d\n\nThe Giant stretched his arms overhead. He pushed up onto his feet and popped his back. He rolled his shoulders and shook out his neck. \u201cL\u00ed\u00f0ur vel sem n\u00fdr. Hven\u00e6r er n\u00e6sti bardagi?\u201d He motioned for Spear.\n\n\u201cHoo?\u201d\n\nThe Giant hunched down and raised his hands in front of him. \u201cKomdu og \u00e6f\u00f0u me\u00f0 m\u00e9r! Bl\u00e1a rassgati\u00f0 \u00e1 ekki eftir a\u00f0 fara l\u00e9tt me\u00f0 okkur!\u201d\n\nSpear scrunched up his brow. The Giant wanted something. Something\u2026 from Spear\u2026 Was he hungry? Or was he trying to hide behind his hands? It was a very poor hiding spot. Maybe he needed Spear to teach him to hide.\n\n\u201c*Fweeet!*\u201d\n\nSpear looked up. Eyepatch whistled for his attention. \u201cDon\u2019t waste time with this guy. He\u2019s big, but he\u2019s not like us. Mutanimals stick together, they train together.\u201d\n\nEyepatch mirrored The Giant\u2019s stance. Then he nodded at Spear. Spear understood. He raised up his hands.\n\n*Fwoop*\n\nEyepatch punched Spear\u2019s palm. It didn\u2019t hurt, but it was still surprising. \u201cHuhh?\u201d\n\nEyepatch nodded. Another punch. Another punch. Punch punch punch punchpunchpunch. He wasn\u2019t going very hard, but they came fast and they kept coming. Spear stood firm, blocking each of them. What was this? Were they fighting?\n\nFang thought so. She growled at Eyepatch and bared her teeth. Eyepatch stopped his punching, raising his hands overhead and taking a step back. \u201cHey, just training. I\u2019m not gonna hurt the guy.\u201d\n\nWings walked towards Fang. He stretched out his hand as if to pet her. \u201cEasy fella, they\u2019re just playing.\u201d\n\nShe showed off more of her teeth. Wings shrieked and fell backwards. He scooted away from her as quickly as he could. Not very quickly. She could have eaten him if she wanted. Spear was proud she didn\u2019t even try.\n\nThe Giant hauled Wings up to his feet. He took up that same stance. Wings was shaking. He reached out and tapped his fist against The Giant\u2019s palm. \u201cHiyah?\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u00f3ttir m\u00edn berst meira! Aftur!\u201d The Giant roared. Wings screamed and started throwing punches. He could never hurt The Giant, but Spear was starting to get it. They weren\u2019t supposed to. It was practice!\n\n\u201cHoo! Ooh!\u201d He nodded at Eyepatch. He raised his fists up.\n\n\u201cAlright! Now you\u2019re getting it.\u201d Eyepatch squatted down and raised his hands up flat. \u201cDon\u2019t go easy on me now. I\u2019m a lot tougher than I lo-\u201d\n\n**WHAM**\n\nOne punch. Spear swung his arm at Eyepatch only one time. It wasn\u2019t his best punch. It wasn\u2019t even his good arm. Just a playful swing like a lion cub to its mother. It didn\u2019t matter. Even that was enough to send Eyepatch hurtling across the ship. Moustache and Other Girl both hit the deck to not be flattened in his path.\n\nBut the wheel was not so lucky. It exploded into fragments before Eyepatch smacked into the front railing of the ship. Spear, Moustache, The Giant, and Wings all stared wide eyed at one another. Fang perked up her head and looked about.\n\nOther Girl looked at the destroyed wheel. Then at Moustache. \u201cBrace for impact, Doctor.\u201d\n\nMoustache opened his mouth, but the sound that followed was drowned out. The cruel wind chose then to pick up. The sky-ship\u2019s sails swelled, and the ship shot forward nearly twice as fast as it had been going since Spear and his pack had boarded.\n\nSpear looked to the front of the ship. The tower had snuck up on him. It had grown immense since last he looked. It would reach them in only a few moments. Without the wheel, there was no way to tame the sky-ship. \n\nSpear\u2019s fault. It was Spear\u2019s fault. Everyone knew it was his fault. His mistake. But he had to make it right. He had to try. He had to save them.\n\nSpear sprinted on all fours across the deck. The Giant and Wings called out to him. He did not look back. They would be fine. They would be safe. Eyepatch would not. He was dazed and hurt, at the point where the ship would first smash into the tower.\n\nSpear reached him in a single breath. He grabbed Eyepatch by the scruff of his neck and threw him backwards, to The Giant. He would keep him safe. The Giant caught Eyepatch in his arms. Eyepatch was looking at Spear. He reached out, pointing, but Spear already knew.\n\n**CRRRRRRRSH**\n\nThe sky-ship smashed into the tower. Spear took the worst of it. He deserved the worst of it. Stone walls shattered on his body as the sky-ship carved its way forward. The wind had died down, they slowed, little by little, wall by wall. Until the sky-ship came to a dead stop, and Spear was flung off the deck and rolled across the cold black floor.\n\nHe felt pain. Bruises and shallow cuts along his arms and back. But worse, he felt shame. How long had he been a  pack leader? And now he lost control? He slumped on his hands and knees, his face to the floor. He shut his eyes. Why now\u2026?\n\n*Clack, Clack, Clack*\n\nFootsteps. Spear barely heard them over his own thoughts. They were close. He didn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cOh wow, look at this guy!

But she wasn\u2019t too angry either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Behind her, Other Girl was at the wheel. She stared blankly ahead. She\u2019d claimed Ocean\u2019s hat for herself, which Spear took to make her master of the sky-ship. The Giant had bellowed and stomped about after she\u2019d taken control, but he had not raised his fist against her. Spear was glad. It wasn\u2019t worth risking more injury for a hat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear followed Other Girl\u2019s gaze. Off the ship, out to the distance. To the tower. It grew larger with every moment, but it felt different than the first time they\u2019d approached. It felt even more important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blue and Girl were still inside. They had been left behind. After Blue had\u2026 run away. He had to hunt them both. He had to find them. And take them away. This was no place for them, or for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His attention was pulled from the tower back to the sky-ship. Moustache had returned from the ships inside. Clutching a metal skull, he walked up the stairs, followed closely by Eyepatch. They were arguing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear frowned. They were always arguing. Snarling and growling at each other. Spear feared eventually they would get to biting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch hissed. \u201cStop walking away from me and talk to me, Bax. We don\u2019t need more of those damn things, but I need to know what you\u2019re cooking. The pirates locked up, why not the girl? I don\u2019t trust that machine further than I can throw her.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cExcuse me for having more faith in a robot than in you, Hob.\u201d Moustache rolled his eyes. \u201cLast time I entrusted a job to you, I ended up paying for it. Hell, I\u2019m still paying for it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat did you expect? You were an asshole.\u201d Eyepatch side eyed Other Girl. \u201cLook, just, who is she? What\u2019s the deal? She don\u2019t look like one of yours, and I\u2019m not about to have two of you mad scientists jerking my chain.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache turned to face him. \u201cShe\u2019s taking us where we need to go. That\u2019s all you need to know. We\u2019re getting back the caveman\u2019s kid, and nothing more. A favour for saving my life, and Max\u2019s too. Unless you\u2019ve seen Miss Wayneright doing something worth distrust, I suggest you keep your prejudices to yourself, and focus on your own.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch bared his teeth. Spear leaned forward, ready to throw himself between the two. But the biting didn\u2019t come. Eyepatch barged past Moustache, bumping him hard enough that he dropped his metal skull onto the deck. It rolled across the sky-ship, coming to a stop at Other Girl\u2019s black boot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She leaned down and scooped it up. She turned it over in her hand, studying it, before holding her arm out. \u201cYou dropped this.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache shuffled across the floor and snatched it from her. \u201cEyes forward. Hands on the wheel. Don\u2019t mess this up.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other Girl stared at him. Then her eyes raised up to Spear. She motioned him to come closer. He hopped down from the railing and walked to the front of the sky-ship. Other Girl took his wrists, and led his hands onto the wooden wheel. Spear\u2019s eyes widened, and he held onto the wheel as tightly as he dared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHey hey hey!\u201d Moustache shouted angrily and tried to wrestle the wheel away from Spear. Spear\u2019s hands stayed locked in place. \u201cWhat the hell is this!?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other Girl crossed her arms. \u201cDoctor, we are in the sky. Even this lout can fly the ship. There is nothing to crash into. Do not question my piloting just because I\u2019m a woman.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache looked enraged. Other Girl took control of the sky-ship from Spear. Eyepatch chuckled as he took a seat opposite The Giant. \u201cMachine\u2019s got jokes.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear ran from the wheel. He didn\u2019t want to ruin things. Not when they were this close. Hunting and killing, those he could do. Controlling Fang, he could try. But controlling the sky-ship? No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant laughed as Spear rushed past him. \u201cEngin sk\u00f6mm, vinur. \u00dea\u00f0 eru ekki allir h\u00e6fir til a\u00f0 lei\u00f0a skipi\u00f0.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wings stepped back and raised his hands. \u201cDone! Damn, you are just one big wound, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant stretched his arms overhead. He pushed up onto his feet and popped his back. He rolled his shoulders and shook out his neck. \u201cL\u00ed\u00f0ur vel sem n\u00fdr. Hven\u00e6r er n\u00e6sti bardagi?\u201d He motioned for Spear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHoo?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant hunched down and raised his hands in front of him. \u201cKomdu og \u00e6f\u00f0u me\u00f0 m\u00e9r! Bl\u00e1a rassgati\u00f0 \u00e1 ekki eftir a\u00f0 fara l\u00e9tt me\u00f0 okkur!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear scrunched up his brow. The Giant wanted something. Something\u2026 from Spear\u2026 Was he hungry? Or was he trying to hide behind his hands? It was a very poor hiding spot. Maybe he needed Spear to teach him to hide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c&lt;em&gt;Fweeet!&lt;/em&gt;\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear looked up. Eyepatch whistled for his attention. \u201cDon\u2019t waste time with this guy. He\u2019s big, but he\u2019s not like us. Mutanimals stick together, they train together.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch mirrored The Giant\u2019s stance. Then he nodded at Spear. Spear understood. He raised up his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fwoop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch punched Spear\u2019s palm. It didn\u2019t hurt, but it was still surprising. \u201cHuhh?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyepatch nodded. Another punch. Another punch. Punch punch punch punchpunchpunch. He wasn\u2019t going very hard, but they came fast and they kept coming. Spear stood firm, blocking each of them. What was this? Were they fighting?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fang thought so. She growled at Eyepatch and bared her teeth. Eyepatch stopped his punching, raising his hands overhead and taking a step back. \u201cHey, just training. I\u2019m not gonna hurt the guy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wings walked towards Fang. He stretched out his hand as if to pet her. \u201cEasy fella, they\u2019re just playing.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She showed off more of her teeth. Wings shrieked and fell backwards. He scooted away from her as quickly as he could. Not very quickly. She could have eaten him if she wanted. Spear was proud she didn\u2019t even try.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant hauled Wings up to his feet. He took up that same stance. Wings was shaking. He reached out and tapped his fist against The Giant\u2019s palm. \u201cHiyah?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cD\u00f3ttir m\u00edn berst meira! Aftur!\u201d The Giant roared. Wings screamed and started throwing punches. He could never hurt The Giant, but Spear was starting to get it. They weren\u2019t supposed to. It was practice!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHoo! Ooh!\u201d He nodded at Eyepatch. He raised his fists up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlright! Now you\u2019re getting it.\u201d Eyepatch squatted down and raised his hands up flat. \u201cDon\u2019t go easy on me now. I\u2019m a lot tougher than I lo-\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One punch. Spear swung his arm at Eyepatch only one time. It wasn\u2019t his best punch. It wasn\u2019t even his good arm. Just a playful swing like a lion cub to its mother. It didn\u2019t matter. Even that was enough to send Eyepatch hurtling across the ship. Moustache and Other Girl both hit the deck to not be flattened in his path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the wheel was not so lucky. It exploded into fragments before Eyepatch smacked into the front railing of the ship. Spear, Moustache, The Giant, and Wings all stared wide eyed at one another. Fang perked up her head and looked about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other Girl looked at the destroyed wheel. Then at Moustache. \u201cBrace for impact, Doctor.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moustache opened his mouth, but the sound that followed was drowned out. The cruel wind chose then to pick up. The sky-ship\u2019s sails swelled, and the ship shot forward nearly twice as fast as it had been going since Spear and his pack had boarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear looked to the front of the ship. The tower had snuck up on him. It had grown immense since last he looked. It would reach them in only a few moments. Without the wheel, there was no way to tame the sky-ship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear\u2019s fault. It was Spear\u2019s fault. Everyone knew it was his fault. His mistake. But he had to make it right. He had to try. He had to save them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear sprinted on all fours across the deck. The Giant and Wings called out to him. He did not look back. They would be fine. They would be safe. Eyepatch would not. He was dazed and hurt, at the point where the ship would first smash into the tower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear reached him in a single breath. He grabbed Eyepatch by the scruff of his neck and threw him backwards, to The Giant. He would keep him safe. The Giant caught Eyepatch in his arms. Eyepatch was looking at Spear. He reached out, pointing, but Spear already knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRRRRRRRSH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sky-ship smashed into the tower. Spear took the worst of it. He deserved the worst of it. Stone walls shattered on his body as the sky-ship carved its way forward. The wind had died down, they slowed, little by little, wall by wall. Until the sky-ship came to a dead stop, and Spear was flung off the deck and rolled across the cold black floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He felt pain. Bruises and shallow cuts along his arms and back. But worse, he felt shame. How long had he been a  pack leader? And now he lost control? He slumped on his hands and knees, his face to the floor. He shut his eyes. Why now\u2026?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clack, Clack, Clack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Footsteps. Spear barely heard them over his own thoughts. They were close. He didn\u2019t care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cOh wow, look at this guy! You\u2019ve met with a &lt;em&gt;bear&lt;/em&gt;ible fate, haven\u2019t you?

It was the reason he\u2019d left.\n\nThat determination did not fail him. In time, he found a new people. A band of warriors, united by nothing but drive to eat and to live.

He heard screaming. Not one or two screams. A chorus of screams. Growing quieter with each second.\n\nHe ran from his tent. Even under the dark of the moon, the air was bleeding. Deep crimson, the smell and taste of death. Every breath was walking through a warzone. Thrawn could not see his men. He could hear them. Hear them being rended apart. But he could not reach them.\n\nHe ran and he ran and he searched. He listened. He tried to make sense of it all, tried to see what was happening. An ambush, a raid, a nightmare, a wandering predator, a roving army, sudden onset psychosis.\n\nIt was none of those.\n\nThrawn gazed upward. There he saw it. A black and towering shape of a man that loomed over his encampment. It did not see them. It walked through the camp as Thrawn would walk through a line of ants. Every step brought ruin and death. And it did not care. It did not notice. \n\nThe existence of the thing questioned everything Thrawn understood. He had thought he understood his place in the world. Not alone at the top, but near it. Comfortable. Safe. Able to protect his people for as long as he lived. Between them, they could conquer anything. Outwit and outmatch.\n\nBut how could one outwit a hurricane? How could one outmatch an earthquake? This, that walked before them, was worse than either a hundred fold.\n\nThen something horrible happened. A chance encounter millenia in the making. A destiny forged long before Thrawn first drew breath.\n\nThe calamity looked upon him. And in its searing red eyes Thrawn understood clearly. This was not a cruel and angry god. He was face to face with The Devil.\n\nA million and one questions burned in Thrawn's mind. The hows and whys and whens of it all swirled like a vortex in his mind. But he came to one question, one he often drew upon in times of strife and indecision.\n\nHow would he win?\n\nIt was the only question that ever mattered. Victory at any cost. \n\nHe was a warrior. He could challenge The Devil, fight and die in vain to save the scant few of his army that remained. He was a general. He could lead them in a final charge that was sure to impress their foreign gods in one last act of bravery. He was an outsider. He could flee, leave the dead and dying, start again with a new band, a new army to be crushed under the careless heel of The Devil.\n\nBut those would not bring victory. They did not promise a future. He had considered all courses, plotted all paths forward. Only one would end this night\u2019s bloodshed in a single, decisive action.\n\nHe had worn many names, and buried them long ago. Now, he would take another.\n\nBefore The Devil, Thrawn kneeled.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grand Admiral.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kivu\u2019raw\u2019nuru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mitth\u2019raw\u2019naruodo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had worn many names in his time.

Even under the dark of the moon, the air was bleeding. Deep crimson, the smell and taste of death. Every breath was walking through a warzone. Thrawn could not see his men. He could hear them. Hear them being rended apart. But he could not reach them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He ran and he ran and he searched. He listened. He tried to make sense of it all, tried to see what was happening. An ambush, a raid, a nightmare, a wandering predator, a roving army, sudden onset psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was none of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thrawn gazed upward. There he saw it. A black and towering shape of a man that loomed over his encampment. It did not see them. It walked through the camp as Thrawn would walk through a line of ants. Every step brought ruin and death. And it did not care. It did not notice. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The existence of the thing questioned everything Thrawn understood. He had thought he understood his place in the world. Not alone at the top, but near it. Comfortable. Safe. Able to protect his people for as long as he lived. Between them, they could conquer anything. Outwit and outmatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But how could one outwit a hurricane? How could one outmatch an earthquake? This, that walked before them, was worse than either a hundred fold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then something horrible happened. A chance encounter millenia in the making. A destiny forged long before Thrawn first drew breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The calamity looked upon him. And in its searing red eyes Thrawn understood clearly. This was not a cruel and angry god. He was face to face with The Devil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A million and one questions burned in Thrawn&amp;#39;s mind. The hows and whys and whens of it all swirled like a vortex in his mind. But he came to one question, one he often drew upon in times of strife and indecision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How would he win?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the only question that ever mattered. Victory at any cost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was a warrior. He could challenge The Devil, fight and die in vain to save the scant few of his army that remained. He was a general. He could lead them in a final charge that was sure to impress their foreign gods in one last act of bravery. He was an outsider. He could flee, leave the dead and dying, start again with a new band, a new army to be crushed under the careless heel of The Devil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But those would not bring victory. They did not promise a future. He had considered all courses, plotted all paths forward. Only one would end this night\u2019s bloodshed in a single, decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He had worn many names, and buried them long ago. Now, he would take another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before The Devil, Thrawn kneeled.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10uomcg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/j7d0apb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/", "name": "t1_j7d0apb", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675634218.0, "created_utc": 1675634218.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Character Scramble 16 GRAND FINALS: World Is Yours", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "link_author": "OddDirective", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7d0965", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "7thSonOfSons", "num_comments": 45, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7d083d", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g4m6x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "#Pantheon, I\n\n#Starring\n\n**Grand Admiral Thrawn** as Thrawn", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Pantheon, I&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Starring&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grand Admiral Thrawn&lt;/strong&gt; as Thrawn&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10uomcg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/j7d0965/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/", "name": "t1_j7d0965", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675634201.0, "created_utc": 1675634201.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Character Scramble 16 GRAND FINALS: World Is Yours", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "link_author": "OddDirective", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7d083d", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "7thSonOfSons", "num_comments": 45, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7d069j", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g4m6x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Wings was growling and murmuring to himself. Spear could barely hear him. Between the whipping wind and the beating of Wings\u2019 wings, it was difficult. Not to mention Spear\u2019s attention solely on the sounds of battle from The Giant above. But he held on tight, as Wings slowly. Slowly. *Very* slowly. Carried them through the air and up towards the sky-ship.\n\nFang roared up at them. Spear doubted Wings could carry her too. He was struggling just to carry Spear.\n\nAs they climbed up and above the railing, Spear got a good look at the deck of the sky-ship. The Giant was tearing through the crew. His axe ripped them apart like they weren\u2019t even there. And they ignored him like he wasn\u2019t there. His swings did not kill the crew of the ship, it didn\u2019t injure them, it only passed through their body like wind.\n\n\u201cHelv\u00edtis draugar! Leyf\u00f0u m\u00e9r bara a\u00f0 drepa \u00feig!\u201d\n\n\u201cHa, I knew we\u2019d need ghost busting!\u201d\n\nSpear gave the thumbs up and threw himself out of Wings grip. He tumbled across the floor of the ship. In that same motion he pulled forth his white-tipped Spear and stabbed at the heart of a transparent crew member.\n\nHe did not bleed. He was not cut. But still the thrust hurt him. The ivory at the end of Spear\u2019s Spear glinted. When he yanked it the other way through his opponent, their body was gone entirely.\n\nThe Giant laughed a hearty laugh. \u201cHef\u00f0i \u00e1tt a\u00f0 vita a\u00f0 \u00fe\u00fa myndir taka \u00fe\u00e1tt \u00ed gle\u00f0inni.\u201d He waved Wings down to join them. \u201cKomdu, krakki, \u00fea\u00f0 \u00fearf a\u00f0 drepa.\u201d\n\nWings shook his head. \u201cUh, no can do, Mr. Thorkell. I just got here from the beach and boy are my wings tired, heh. Good luck to you guys though!\u201d\n\nHe fluttered over to the edge of the ship and took a seat. He looked exhausted. He was weaker than Spear thought. But still, he got them there. He was part of the pack, for better or worse. Spear would protect him.\n\nThe crew of the sky-ship rallied. They took up transparent swords and shields and charged at Spear and The Giant. Let them come. That only made them easier to kill.\n\nThey swarmed the pair of hunters in a moment. Attacking from every direction, up close and at reach. Their swords, though light as air, still cut like steel. The Giant was quickly bleeding from a number of gashes. But for Spear\u2026 he still was not cut. The blades struck him, the spear points jabbed him, the shield\u2019s still bashed him, but it left no mark.\n\nSurrounded by enemies he still raised his arm to look at himself. It was thicker than he remembered. Heavier too. Had he always been so hairy. He ran his hand along his arm? No, not hair. Much too rough, much too thick. It was wool.\n\nHe had been like this since he woke up. Since the golden field. But it still felt strange. It felt like not Spear.\n\nThe Giant slapped the back of his head. \u201cHaltu hausnum ni\u00f0ri, vinur! Vi\u00f0 vorum ekki \u00f6ll blessu\u00f0 af gu\u00f0unum!\u201d\n\nThe slap still stung. The Giant still towered over him. He still had his pack, and they still needed his help. And he still had his Spear. He was still Spear.\n\n\u201cHo!\u201d Spear hunkered down and back into the fight.\n\nThe swarm of men around them were nothing before him and his Spear. Every thrust. Every sweep. Every swing. More of them vanished into the night sky. The Giant fought to evade them, to keep from picking up too many scars, but Spear fought to kill them.\n\nAnd in no time at all, the sky-ship was cleared. Any trace of the crew was as good as mist in the wind. The Giant took a deep breath and wiped the blood off him. It was a lot of blood. Spear had let his focus slip, and his friend had gotten hurt. He reached out to The Giant. A way to apologise.\n\nThe Giant laughed. \u201cBara holds\u00e1r.\u201d He reached behind his waist and pulled out his second axe. \u201cEn vi\u00f0 erum ekki b\u00fain.\u201d\n\nSpear turned to look to the front of the ship. Ocean stood waiting for them. One hand on his sword, the other leaning against the ship\u2019s wheel. He sighed, grabbed the wheel, and yanked it downward.\n\nThe ship lurched immediately to one side. Spear tumbled down the side of the deck, but The Giant managed to stay standing. He grinned widely and raised his axes. \u201cSt\u00f3r mist\u00f6k. \u00c9g er kominn me\u00f0 sj\u00f3f\u00e6tur.\u201d\n\nSpear jammed the tip of his Spear into the floor to keep from tumbling down to the beach. The sky-ship was already righting itself. It didn\u2019t slow down The Giant. He charged the length of the ship, axes in hand, and rained both down where Ocean stood.\n\nOcean leaped backwards. The Giant\u2019s axes slammed through the floorboards. Ocean lunged right back forward, thrusting out his sword as he went. The Giant punched the flat of the sword, knocking it off course only for Ocean\u2019s other hand to reach forward. A silver blade thrust out from beneath his sleeve and buried itself into The Giant\u2019s stomach.\n\nThe sky-ship was nearly stable. Spear could stand. He ran instead. Ocean pulled his knife back from The Giant\u2019s stomach. A lot of blood hit the deck.\n\nThe Giant still stood. He reeled his head back and slammed his forehead into Ocean\u2019s. Ocean shouted out in pain and stumbled backward. The Giant rose to full height just as Spear reached his side. The Giant raised up his axes and brought them to rest on his shoulders. \u201cLeggjum \u00feennan hund ni\u00f0ur.\u201d\n\nOcean put a hand to his forehead. He was bleeding. He shook his head and flourished his sword. \u201cI\u2019m not here for you idiotiaid. Why not just give up, eh? Any chance of that?\u201d\n\nSpear flung forward and jammed his Spear straight where Ocean had stood. He dodged to the side. The Giant followed behind, swinging his axe for Ocean\u2019s neck. Ocean ducked down below it. Spear hooked his arm and threw a punch where Ocean was now. Ocean rolled forward and jammed his wrist blade into The Giant\u2019s leg.\n\nThe Giant raised his knee and smashed it into Ocean\u2019s jaw. Ocean grit his teeth and yanked his hand back. Spear swung his Spear up just in time, smashing Ocean\u2019s wrist on the edge of his Spear. Ocean hissed angrily and shook out the pain in his arm.\n\nThe Giant rammed his shoulder into Ocean\u2019s chest. Ocean coughed up blood. He pulled both arms back. His other wrist revealed its own blade. Both knives pierced into The Giant\u2019s shoulders.\n\nThat was a mistake. He couldn\u2019t move now. The Giant wrapped his arms around Ocean and squeezed him tight. Ocean tried to fight his way out, kicking and flailing, but nothing and no one was stronger than The Giant.\n\nA grey sack fell from Ocean\u2019s clothes. It hit the deck and immediately the air was filled with smoke. Spear could not see The Giant. He could not see Ocean. He could barely see himself. He heard the *swish swish* of blades cutting the air, but he could not tell from where.\n\n*Swish*\n\nHe felt a cold metal drag across his back. As soon as he turned around, nothing waited for him but more smoke.\n\n*Shlick*\n\nAnother jab, this one sinking into his shoulder. It wasn\u2019t very deep. But he felt blood trickle down his spine. Spear\u2019s face scrunched up in a rage. He turned around again.\n\n\u201cHRUUUUUUUUAAAAAAH!!\u201d\n\nHe bellowed into the smoke, and the smoke cleared. He could see the sky-ship. He saw The Giant, bloodied and dazed, but still breathing. He saw Ocean. He was back at the ship's wheel. He was reaching for something at his waist.\n\nHe shoved the wheel the other way. The ship began to sway. Spear was ready for it this time. He had seen the weapon Ocean drew too many times. Lizard. The Immortal. Eyepatch. Blue. He knew what it was now. He knew what it was for. If he let Ocean use that weapon, one of them would die.\n\nSpear tensed up his legs. He steadied himself, kept himself from being knocked about by the sudden change in the ship's floor. He pulled his arm back, clutching the haft of his Spear. And he launched it with all the force he could.\n\nOcean drew his weapon and took aim. It was too late. The white tip of the Spear cut through the air, cut through the weapon, and slammed into Ocean\u2019s shoulder. His arm curled and twitched, he bit his lip hard to keep himself screaming out. Ocean took a deep breath through his nose. His other arm was moving.\n\n\u201cAlways keep two guns, dyn gwyllt.\u201d\n\nSpear\u2019s eyes widened. A second weapon, tucked into his belt. He drew this one just as quickly, its killing end pointed right at Spear. Spear stared down at it. It was like everything moved in slow motion. Ocean\u2019s finger squeezing down, the spark of light from inside the weapon, and the shot that followed.\n\n\u201cVenom stinger!\u201d\n\nThe ring of the shot echoed through the sky. The blast that followed did not hit Spear. It did not hit The Giant. It did not hit anyone. It flew uselessly into the night. Ocean\u2019s body hit the deck. Out cold.\n\nWings stood over him, flexing his arm and clenching his fist. He was panting heavily. His legs were shaking. But he\u2019d done it. He had saved Spear.\n\nHe raised his hands over head in celebration. \u201cWoooooo! We did it guys! All of us, together, but, you know, me mostly. If you really think about it.\u201d\n\nThe Giant fell to the floor. Spear ran to his side, but he did not fall from pain. He did not succumb to his injuries. He was doubled over, clutching his stomach and laughing.\n\n\u201c21, what the hell\u2019s going on up there! You dead or what?\u201d\n\nSpear and Wings peered over the edge of the ship. The land-ship was sat beneath them. Eyepatch, Moustache, and Fang were all looking up at them. Spear gave them a thumbs up.\n\nEven this far away, Spear could tell Moustache was rolling his eyes. It was second nature at this point. \u201cIf you\u2019re all done playing pirate, drop anchor and we\u2019ll hall the rustbucket up there. I\u2019ve got some serious work to do before we reach the tower.\u201d\n\nSpear nodded. He turned and patted Wings on the back. He seemed to understand. Spear would leave it up to him. Right now, he needed a break. They were going back to the tower. They were going to find Girl. They were going to find Blue.\n\nAnd he was going to save them.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wings was growling and murmuring to himself.

Ocean grit his teeth and yanked his hand back. Spear swung his Spear up just in time, smashing Ocean\u2019s wrist on the edge of his Spear. Ocean hissed angrily and shook out the pain in his arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant rammed his shoulder into Ocean\u2019s chest. Ocean coughed up blood. He pulled both arms back. His other wrist revealed its own blade. Both knives pierced into The Giant\u2019s shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was a mistake. He couldn\u2019t move now. The Giant wrapped his arms around Ocean and squeezed him tight. Ocean tried to fight his way out, kicking and flailing, but nothing and no one was stronger than The Giant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A grey sack fell from Ocean\u2019s clothes. It hit the deck and immediately the air was filled with smoke. Spear could not see The Giant. He could not see Ocean. He could barely see himself. He heard the &lt;em&gt;swish swish&lt;/em&gt; of blades cutting the air, but he could not tell from where.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He felt a cold metal drag across his back. As soon as he turned around, nothing waited for him but more smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shlick&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another jab, this one sinking into his shoulder. It wasn\u2019t very deep. But he felt blood trickle down his spine. Spear\u2019s face scrunched up in a rage. He turned around again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHRUUUUUUUUAAAAAAH!!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He bellowed into the smoke, and the smoke cleared. He could see the sky-ship. He saw The Giant, bloodied and dazed, but still breathing. He saw Ocean. He was back at the ship&amp;#39;s wheel. He was reaching for something at his waist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He shoved the wheel the other way. The ship began to sway. Spear was ready for it this time. He had seen the weapon Ocean drew too many times. Lizard. The Immortal. Eyepatch. Blue. He knew what it was now. He knew what it was for. If he let Ocean use that weapon, one of them would die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear tensed up his legs. He steadied himself, kept himself from being knocked about by the sudden change in the ship&amp;#39;s floor. He pulled his arm back, clutching the haft of his Spear. And he launched it with all the force he could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ocean drew his weapon and took aim. It was too late. The white tip of the Spear cut through the air, cut through the weapon, and slammed into Ocean\u2019s shoulder. His arm curled and twitched, he bit his lip hard to keep himself screaming out. Ocean took a deep breath through his nose. His other arm was moving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cAlways keep two guns, dyn gwyllt.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear\u2019s eyes widened. A second weapon, tucked into his belt. He drew this one just as quickly, its killing end pointed right at Spear. Spear stared down at it. It was like everything moved in slow motion. Ocean\u2019s finger squeezing down, the spark of light from inside the weapon, and the shot that followed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cVenom stinger!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The ring of the shot echoed through the sky. The blast that followed did not hit Spear. It did not hit The Giant. It did not hit anyone. It flew uselessly into the night. Ocean\u2019s body hit the deck. Out cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wings stood over him, flexing his arm and clenching his fist. He was panting heavily. His legs were shaking. But he\u2019d done it. He had saved Spear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He raised his hands over head in celebration. \u201cWoooooo! We did it guys! All of us, together, but, you know, me mostly. If you really think about it.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant fell to the floor. Spear ran to his side, but he did not fall from pain. He did not succumb to his injuries. He was doubled over, clutching his stomach and laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201c21, what the hell\u2019s going on up there! You dead or what?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear and Wings peered over the edge of the ship. The land-ship was sat beneath them. Eyepatch, Moustache, and Fang were all looking up at them. Spear gave them a thumbs up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even this far away, Spear could tell Moustache was rolling his eyes. It was second nature at this point. \u201cIf you\u2019re all done playing pirate, drop anchor and we\u2019ll hall the rustbucket up there. I\u2019ve got some serious work to do before we reach the tower.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spear nodded. He turned and patted Wings on the back. He seemed to understand. Spear would leave it up to him. Right now, he needed a break. They were going back to the tower. They were going to find Girl. They were going to find Blue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he was going to save them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10uomcg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/j7d083d/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/", "name": "t1_j7d083d", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/whowouldwin", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675634188.0, "created_utc": 1675634188.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/10uomcg/character_scramble_16_grand_finals_world_is_yours/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s599", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Character Scramble 16 GRAND FINALS: World Is Yours", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "whowouldwin", "link_author": "OddDirective", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7d069j", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "7thSonOfSons", "num_comments": 45, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7d03v7", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_g4m6x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Spear stared. \n\nFang turned her head to the sky and stared.\n\nThe Giant\u2019s jaw hung open.

Fang screeched after only the first impact and took off in a sprint. Spear hung tightly to her body. This was the worst kind of hunt. On land it would be easy. Even in the sea had he proven his mastery of the hunt. To stab and bite and punch and pummel came as easily as breath. But to hunt a great thing of the sky was something else.\n\nThe land-ship sped off beside them. It swerved in and out, close and away, as it avoided shot after shot from the black barrels lining the sky-ship. Eyepatch dug his fingers into the roof of the land ship. His claws punctured the metal and he grit his teeth, staring up at the sky-ship. \n\nWith The Giant on her back, Fang could not run as she liked. He was huge and heavy, a weight on her shoulders that dragged her feet. But with him, running was not nearly so important. When one of those black death balls came too close, it was The Giant and his axe who shattered them. He laughed and roared with each one destroyed. That look in his eye, the eyes of a killer, grew more excited as he laid waste to the sky-ship\u2019s assault.\n\nSpear looked back at him. And smiled. Another deathball flew down at Fang. But this one was Spear\u2019s. He pulled his arm back, gripped the haft of his Spear, and thrust forward. The ivory tip split the deathball like cutting through water. In one end and out the other, shattering into chunks along the sand.\n\n\u201c\u00deannig er \u00fea\u00f0 gert, vinur!\u201d The Giant turned his gaze to the sky-ship and hollered. \u201cErtu me\u00f0 fleiri brellur? \u00de\u00fa ert a\u00f0 sv\u00e6fa mig!\u201d\n\nWay above, Ocean scowled and pounded his fist on the railing. \u201cFull sail! Paratowch i fyrddio'r bastardiaid!!\u201d\n\nThe winds picked up. Sand and waves were whipped into a frenzy. The sails of the sky-ship caught wind and crested through the air like a hawk. The thunderous volley had stopped. The shadow of the sky-ship washed over Spear and his new pack. They were gaining speed faster. Fang, still hauling Spear and The Giant, couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nThe land-ship tried. Spear could hear Wings sputtering and panicking to keep ahead of the sky-ship. \u201cAw crap, aw crap, crappity\u2026 shit!\u201d \n\nWith the wind at its back and no sand slowing its path, it was a lost cause. The sky-ship overtook them. Eyepatch ducked down in the land-ship, surely sensing another rain of death upon them. But the black barrels did not blow, and the deathballs did not fall. \n\nInstead what came was a great iron hook, connected to the sky-ship with a thick metal chain. It smashed through the top of the land-ship. Its inhabitants all shouted out in a mixture of anger or fear. The hook caught itself on the roof of the land-ship, and its taut chain grew tight. Spear\u2019s eyes widened as it began to pull the land-ship into the air.\n\nMoustache raced to the window and called out towards them. \u201cThorkell! Don\u2019t just sit there like a lump, get this anchor off us or we\u2019re not making it out of here.\u201d\n\nThe Giant laughed. He stood up and rolled his wrist. \u201cAkkeri einhvers sta\u00f0ar annars sta\u00f0ar, ferjuma\u00f0ur!\u201d\n\nHe hurled his axe longwise. It struck the metal chain connecting the ship to the hook, and it snapped at a touch. The land-ship crashed back into the beach. It was on its last leg, wheels and walls barely hanging on, but it still roared with life.\n\nThe Giant\u2019s smile grew. He kicked off of Fang, and now instead rode the roof of the land-ship. He reached out and took hold of the chain an instant before it flew up, up, and launched The Giant on the sky-ship.\n\nSpear panicked. Immediately he heard The Giant shouting and roaring with rage and fury. He couldn\u2019t see his friend. But he saw the sky-ship rocking and swaying. He heard the clang and the thunk of his axe tearing into battle. But at the first howl of frustration, he couldn\u2019t sit back and wait.\n\nHe leaped from Fang\u2019s back. She roared at him, but he needed to move. He had to be quick. He would not lose any more of his pack. Spear swung through the shattered glass and back into the land-ship. He muscled past Moustache and Eyepatch to the front. To Wings.\n\n\u201cUhh, hey, you? You wanna dri- Oh okay, we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nSpear plucked Wings out of his seat. Moustache and Eyepatch both shouted at him. Other Girl stayed quiet and slid into Wings\u2019 seat to grip the wheel. \u201cYour friends quite the heel, doctor.\u201d\n\nSpear climbed out of the land-ship and onto its roof. Wings was tucked under his arm until Spear let him free. He pointed up at the sky-ship. \u201cHoo! Oooh!\u201d\n\nWings looked up at the ship. \u201cOh that. That\u2019s the Jackdaw. Says so on the side! It\u2019s a pirate ship!\u201d He gave Spear a thumbs up.\n\nGood, he understood. Spear grabbed Wings and slung him over his shoulders. Wings screamed as Spear held on tight to his arms, and leaped off of the land-ship.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7th", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spear stared. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fang turned her head to the sky and stared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Giant\u2019s jaw hung open.
