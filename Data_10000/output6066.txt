They have to want to help themselves. If she is not willing to try counseling for the marriage OR for the emotional problems, OR even communicate with you, then it's out of your hands. This issue isn't going to resolve itself.\n\nThat does not sound like a healthy environment for anyone. I can't tell you what to do, but i can tell you that i used to be in a  unhealthy relationship, and  once the decision was made to have a divorce and the initial process was over, things have been SO much better. Like, i can't even believe how bad it was before, i didn't realize or was in denial until after i was out and was able to breathe again. Life is really too short to live like that. But that is me, i can't speak for your relationship.\n\nI wish i could help or offer advice but i don't know what to suggest, she sounds quite difficult to deal with and the family members equally concerning. Outright leaving without a word isn't going to bode well, trying to talk to her doesn't sound useful either. You could ask, \"Do you want me to leave?\" perhaps if it were her decision, it would be most amicable. I wish the best for you.

I can&amp;#39;t tell you what to do, but i can tell you that i used to be in a  unhealthy relationship, and  once the decision was made to have a divorce and the initial process was over, things have been SO much better. Like, i can&amp;#39;t even believe how bad it was before, i didn&amp;#39;t realize or was in denial until after i was out and was able to breathe again. Life is really too short to live like that.
