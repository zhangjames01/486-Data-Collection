I remember seeing a website posted on /r/nfl in the last couple weeks where you could go team-by-team and look through all of their contracts and cap space, and seeing teams that had no hope of playoff berths in the near future throwing a huge chunk of their star player's contract into the future. It looked like a kind of fiscal irresponsibility, but I assumed that was just my naivete since it didn't seem logical that businesses on the scale of NFL teams would be that mismanaged.
