There are a number of reasons for this but some of the more common are faster tracks and a more-relaxed atmosphere.

We chose to extend Shelby Harris after we could not trade him and saved good money by lowering his cap hit from approximately 12 million to 7. Myles Adams was also tendered as an ERFA to maintain a former UDFA with some upside. Drafting Keeanu Benton rounded out our 3-4 DE position group as we got a strong mix of youth and veterans with pass-rush prowess, a mix that had been lacking with only veterans in recent years. Jarrod Hewitt also remained on the roster, but the team only views him as a depth piece. Benton, Jefferson, Harris, and Adams should provide adequate pass rush for a team that expects their EDGE group to be the main position that racks up defensive statistics. \n\nNT: Al Woods and Bryan Mone were our two NTs all of last year, but with Woods being incredibly old and taking longer to be recovered from injuries, and Mone coming off an ACL tear, we knew we needed to take a refresh at the position.  With many attempts and many fails to trade Al Woods and Mone, both players who were cheap and could provide depth for Super Bowl-ready teams, we decided to keep them and hope with a clear starter at the position we could play Mone and Woods for a few snaps a game and get good value out of them. This led to us drafting Mazi Smith at the top of the 2nd round. The clear #1 NT in this year's draft, Mazi provides the pass-rush upside this team desperately needs. As you will see later, picking Mazi Smith was the hardest decision of our draft, we were incredibly happy with both players we could have gotten with here and decided to choose Mazi for the reasons above. Mazi, Woods, and perhaps Mone if he makes the 53-man roster will solidify the anchor of our defensive line. \n\n**EDGE and Outside Linebacker \u2013 Uchenna Nwosu, Will Anderson, Darrell Taylor, Boye Mafe.**\n\n*Depth: Bruce Irvin, Alton Robinson, Tyreke Smith, Joshua Onujiogu, Chris Garrett, Andre Jones.*\n\nEntering the offseason Seattle viewed EDGE as a want, rather than a need, due to the emergence of Darrell Taylor at the end of the year and Uchenna Nwosu's career year as #1 on the depth chart. The Seahawks also thought that Boye Mafe was in line for more reps and Bruce Irvin could easily be brought back as EDGE4. For those reasons alone we did not add anyone else in the free agency period. Entering the draft, we felt the same way but were more than happy to take Will Anderson, who was #1 on our Board if the draft fell just right. Safe to say, with 4 QBs going in the top 4, we had our choice at every QB eligible except for a few quarterbacks and took Will Anderson Jr. With the applaud by many in our war room and outside of it, we knew we had turned our EDGE group into one that would be one of the league's most feared groups in the coming months. The team still has Alton Robinson, Tyreke Smith, and Joshua Onujiogu as depth pieces with upside. Smith has yet to play a snap in the NFL, Robinson has yet to play in the team's new 3-4 with his new physique, and Joshua was a UDFA from 2022 that has played very few snaps.\n\n**Off-Ball Linebacker \u2013 Cody Barton, Tanner Muse, Jordyn Brooks.**\n\n*Depth: Ben Burr-Kirven, Vi Jones, John Rhattigan, Cam Jones, Micah Baskerville.*\n\nLinebacker is the one position where we were unhappy with our depth chart exiting the offseason. As mentioned before, the pick that Mazi Smith was taken at was also a pick we were equally open to taking Trenton Simpson with. Trenton Simpson would have played the WLB role (more coverage based) of our 2 MLBs in our 3-4, while Barton and Muse would have competed for the main MLB role (run-stopper that can do well in coverage) until Jordyn Brooks was healthy enough to return from his torn ACL. We ended up taking Mazi Smith and were debating if we should trade up for Trenton Simpson but it was too late as he was taken shortly after Smith. This led to us maintaining the exact same LB group we walked out of the 2022 season with. We aren't displeased with the linebackers as we saw massive improvements from Barton and Brooks alike, as well as good potential from Muse, but would have rather drafted a young rookie who could allow Brooks' run-stopping abilities to be fully put on display. Barton and Brooks will suffice for the team in 2023. Ben Burr-Kirven and Vi Jones will be solid depth for us, while Jon Rhattigan who was signed to the veteran minimum early on can also play if needed. The team did attempt to sign Germaine Pratt and Bobby Wagner, but after prices were too high for the team to stay in the bidding at the time, the Seahawks backed out on both options. Knowing how the draft unfolded, we would have paid whatever was required to bring in Pratt or Wagner. \n\n**Cornerback \u2013 Tariq Woolen, Mike Jackson, Coby Bryant.**\n\n*Depth: Tre Brown, Jammie Robinson, Rejzohn Wright*\n\nThe Seahawks kept the same 3 starters at CB knowing Woolen is the team's clear #1 option, Bryant played well enough at a new position in Nickel to warrant the team allowing him to play there for another season, and Jackson was above-average at CB2 and didn't need to be removed, but rather beaten out in a CB2 competition by other young options. That is why Robinson and Wright were drafted. Both players will provide good competition to take Jackson's CB2 spot, but the team knows regardless of who wins, based on Michael's last season of play, the team will be in good hands. The Seahawks haven't fully given up on Tre Brown and expect him to be fully in the CB2 competition. For now, the job will be Jacksons to lose, however. \n\n**Safety \u2013 Quandre Diggs, Jamal Adams, Ryan Neal.**\n\n*Depth: Johnathan Abrams, Joey Blount, Jammie Robinson.*\n\nThere wasn't any maneuvering at the safety position, but the team made sure to bring back their guys. Quandre Diggs and Jamal Adams are the clear starters. Ryan Neal will be the 3rd safety unless Adams is injured and Neal needs to start. Abram will be the 4th safety who can play when needed at a box-LB spot or in a traditional safety role and can start if Neal gets injured. Blount provides depth and was a key special teamer for us last season. Quandre Diggs was open to being traded by the team but was never close to being part of a deal. Diggs was also a potential restructure candidate if the team's cap situation got too tight, but by missing out on Pratt and Wagner the team was able to keep Diggs' contract intact. Jamal Adams was also a trade and restructure candidate but a deal never emerged and the team did not want to push more money down the road on Adams' contract which would have made it harder to move off from. Ryan Neal was tendered as one of our key players and is crucial to the team's success going forward. Johnathan Abram was signed by the team in external free agency for veteran minimum after refusing an offer by the team with a goal to look in free agency to see if a market had developed for him. Lastly, Blount was never to be cut or traded knowing his special team abilities were valuable for the team, and if he were cut the Seahawks would need another special teamer to replace him, making the move null, effectively.", "edited": 1678195330.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "oldschoollogo", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u200b"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANNOTATED DEPTH CHART, CONTINUED - DEFENSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defensive Line \u2013 Al Woods, Shelby Harris, Quinton Jefferson, Mazi Smith, Keeanu Benton.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depth: Bryan Mone, Myles Adams, Jarrod Hewitt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3-5T: Looking at the basic raw cap hit values for our players at 3-5T, such as Shelby Harris and Quinton Jefferson we felt we needed to either cut them or find a trade partner, but as the offseason progressed and trade partners wouldn&amp;#39;t arise, we felt dealing with their cap hits, either by extending them or leaving their contracts alone was the best solution.

After signing him to a deal very similar to the one he got in real life we then signed Drew Lock for cheap, knowing he is one of the premium backups in the league. Sean Clifford was a UDFA signing that intrigued the team enough to warrant a contract. We were contemplating drafting Richardson at 5 if he fell to us in the draft, but with the #1 prospect in Will Anderson falling, we left happy with our selections. \n\n**Running Back \u2013 Ken Walker, Rashaad Penny, Ezekiel Elliott, Tyjae Spears.**\n\n*Depth: DeeJay Dallas, Godwin Igwebuike, Wayne Taulapapa.*\n\nKenneth Walker was the clear lead back for Seattle, but re-signing Rashaad Penny was a priority given his elite potential when healthy. Godwin Igwebuike was also re-signed, but mainly for his talent as a Kick Returner that was on full display during the last few games of the season. Ezekiel Elliot was a surprise to us as well, but being able to get the best 3rd down back in the league who can block and pass catcher, while providing a change of pace for the team was an opportunity too good to pass up. Entering the draft running back was a position we wished to add some youth to, and after being clamored about by numerous people including our General Manager we took him at a spot we felt we were comfortable addressing the position. \n\n**Fullback \u2013 Nick Bellore.**\n\n*Depth: Jack Colletto.*\n\nNick Bellore was kept for his special team qualities and veteran leadership.\n\n**Wide Receiver \u2013 Tyler Lockett, DK Metcalf, Zay Flowers, Marquise Goodwin.**\n\n*Depth: Jonathan Mingo, Dareke Young, Dee Eskridge, Penny Hart, Cade Johnson, Easop Winston, Kearis Jackson.*\n\nThe Seahawks entered this offseason (and many of the last) having a major hole at their Wide Receiver 3 position knowing Marquise Goodwin was a free agent. After re-signing him in external free agency to a 1 year 2.5 mil deal, which was the same one we offered in internal free agency, we locked up our WR3 but were still open to adding competition. Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf had recently signed extensions in previous seasons and were locked up as our WR 1A and WR 1B. Zay Flowers was one of the best WRs in this draft with a physique similar to Lockett, and with an expected major hole there in the years coming, even with the Goodwin signing, we drafted him without hesitation. Jonathan Mingo was a guy many were high on in the late rounds of the draft and drafted him with the approval of many in the war room and many outside praising us for the pick. Dee Eskridge still remained on the team, while Dareke Young and Cade Johnson hadn't done enough to prove themselves as reasons not to go out and venture for more wide receivers to compete and be depth.\n \n**Tight End \u2013 Will Dissly, Noah Fant, Colby Parkinson.**\n\n*Depth: Tyler Mabry*\n\nIn the later days of free agency, while examining the cap situation it was believed that the team did not have room to keep Will Dissly and Noah Fant, while paying all their free agents, including Geno Smith. After many days of active negotiations about Dissly and Fant, including a potential reunion in Denver with his former QB, the team felt Dissly and Fant couldn't be moved and decided to have their TE room before entering the draft. The team could trade either of them in an opportunity that arises knowing Parkinson was seen as adept at being the Tight End 2 entering the season. \n\n**Offensive Tackle \u2013 Charles Cross, Abraham Lucas.**\n\n*Depth: Jake Curhan, Stone Forsythe, Greg Eiland, Jalen McKenzie, Jaylen Thomas.*\n\nThe Seahawks stayed the same here across the entire depth chart at tackle and are pleased with the state of their depth chart enough to go into the season with the 2 second-year tackles starting again after their strong rookie seasons.\n\n**Guard \u2013 Damien Lewis, Phil Haynes.**\n\n*Depth: Kyle Fuller, Jake Curhan, Ethan Brown.*\n\nThe Seahawks knew that Right Guard was a position that we needed to address. Fortunately, the Seahawks in real life chose to re-sign Phil Haynes to a simple 1-year, 4 million contract to be the starter after noticing the weak free agent class at guard. Damien Lewis appeared to have finally settled in at Left Guard and had taken his sophomore year jump in his junior year after being switched from right guard to left guard, allowing the team to rest assured knowing they had their LG. Gabe Jackson was a player we were hoping a trade emerged as the offseason progressed, but with his massive cap hit for a player that had largely regressed, other teams strayed away which led us to cut him in the final days of the mock offseason. Kyle Fuller is a versatile player we brought back for veteran minimum who could play guard and center if he is ever needed. Evan Brown who has evenly split all 24 of his games at both guard and center will be a strong depth piece at guard and a starter at center due to the team's needs at this time.\n\n**Center \u2013 Ethan Brown.**\n\n*Depth: Kyle Fuller, Joey Hunt.*\n\nAs aforementioned, Evan Brown was the big signing for our team in external free agency who was a day 1 starter for a team that badly needed a center after seeing the catastrophe that was Austin Blythe. Speaking of Austin Blythe we had re-signed him as a good depth piece with a chance to start if there were zero other options, but Blythe chose retirement which made Fuller our clear Center 2.

After signing him to a deal very similar to the one he got in real life we then signed Drew Lock for cheap, knowing he is one of the premium backups in the league. Sean Clifford was a UDFA signing that intrigued the team enough to warrant a contract.

Godwin Igwebuike was also re-signed, but mainly for his talent as a Kick Returner that was on full display during the last few games of the season. Ezekiel Elliot was a surprise to us as well, but being able to get the best 3rd down back in the league who can block and pass catcher, while providing a change of pace for the team was an opportunity too good to pass up.

Early in the week we were planning to draft Anthony Richardson at 1.05, but it soon became clear the top-4 spots were all going QB, and we weren\u2019t willing to give as much as was given. That\u2019s because we knew we were going to have our pick of some blue chip defensive prospects, and we ended up with the best overall player in the draft. \n\n\n**1.20 )  Zay Flowers, WR - Boston College**\n\nAlthough Seattle boasts one of the league\u2019s top WR tandems in Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf, the position is very shallow behind those two. We knew we wanted to go WR early, and Flowers was the one we wanted. Athletically very similar to Tyler as a prospect, Flowers might even offer a bit more after the catch. He\u2019s loose and explosive and almost automatically becomes our third receiver. The Giants traded in front of us to take Jordan Addison, who we also liked a lot, and likely would have taken if the Giants had selected Flowers. \n\n\n**2.38 )  Mazi Smith, NT - Michigan**\n\nWe entered the draft knowing that we wanted to add to the defensive line as well as to our linebackers. There were a series of decisions where we would have to make a choice at one point in the draft based on what we hoped would happen later in the draft. Here, there were a number of linebacker prospects we were also seriously considering. We went for Smith in part because we thought we would be able to get a LB later. There aren\u2019t many prospects who can offer what Mazi Smith does, and we thought he did it better than anyone else in the draft - he was our top choice at nose tackle. He\u2019s very large, very strong, and also very nimble for his size. We still have Al Woods, and Mazi Smith slots in as his immediate backup and will be expected to log plenty of snaps in rotation. Smith is also talented enough that he could demand playing time in his own right - potentially even in a similar role to Red Bryant as an oversized defensive end. \n\n\n**2.53 )  Keeanu Benton, DL - Wisconsin**\n\n\nWe were hoping to get a linebacker or cornerback with this pick, but the board didn\u2019t fall our way. Trenton Simpson and Emmanuel Forbes were the top 2 prospects we hoped would get to us. Instead, they were taken and we continued adding to our defensive line. This was probably our least exciting pick, but we hope we\u2019re getting another useful addition to the DL rotation with someone who holds up against the run and can play multiple spots along the line. We did try to trade down from this pick, but no viable offers materialized. \n\n**3.84 )  Tyjae Spears, RB - Tulane**\n\nWe re-signed Rashaad Penny and brought in Zeke Elliott in this mock offseason, but neither of them is a long-term running mate to Kenneth Walker III. With a 4-year rookie deal to go with KWIII\u2019s remaining 3, we ensure that our backfield will always be able to threaten the big play. Tyjae Spears has been a buzzy name since the Senior Bowl, where he was widely regarded as the top running back. He was one of the stars of the combine despite being kept out of most of the drills with a groin tweak. A glimpse of his explosiveness was visible in the 2 drills he did do, jumping 39.5\u201d in the vert with a 10\u20195\u201d broad. His contact balance is incredible and his suddenness and creativity, especially once he hits the second level, make him a big play waiting to happen. He also appears to possess untapped upside as a receiver. In this mock situation it might take him a little more time to see the field than he would elsewhere, but look for him to splash early in his career and demand regular touches. Seattle has struggled a lot with keeping runners healthy in past seasons, so adding another explosive runner was a priority for us. Zach Charbonnet would have also been considered here, and if we hadn\u2019t gone for Spears we likely would have targeted Israel Abanikanda in the next round or two. \n\n\n**4.124 ) Jammie Robinson, DB - FSU**\n\nAt this spot were hoping to take 1 of 3 defensive backs: Jay Ward, JL Skinner, or Jammie Robinson. The first two went before our pick, but we were pleased to add Robinson. He gives us depth at multiple spots in the secondary, with the ability to line up at both safety spots as well as nickel. He is not the biggest or fastest, but he plays with a real edge to him. He is a hard hitter for his size and crashes down with aggression. He will need to prove that he can achieve a certain quality of coverage in the NFL to be considered for a starting FS role in the future, but physically he reminds me a lot of Quandre Diggs - who\u2019s getting a bit older now. If he gives us quality depth at 3 secondary spots while also playing special teams, I\u2019m happy enough with this pick - we\u2019re hopeful that in a year or two he can break into the starting lineup. \n\n**5.148 )  Jonathan Mingo, WR - Ole Miss**\n\nMingo didn\u2019t belong in the 5th round, so we traded up a few spots to get him. We traded the 5th round pick we held a few spots back along with our 6th in exchange for this pick and a 7th. NFL.com\u2019s prospect comparison for him is Anquan Boldin. Numerous reputable evaluators have him as a Day 2 prospect and likely starting WR. He\u2019s big (6\u20192\u201d 220) fast (4.46) strong (22 reps) and explosive (39.5\u201d vert). He has soft hands and can break off big plays with physicality and speed. Why was he here? Didn\u2019t make sense. Along with Flowers, our WR is suddenly deep. Mingo will likely slot in as a WR4 or WR5 and we expect him to steadily work his way up from there. \n\n**5.157 )  Rojzohn Wright, CB - Oregon State**\n\nWe still wanted to add an outside corner to compete with Tre Brown and Michael Jackson opposite Tariq Woolen. Rojzohn Wright doesn\u2019t get a lot of national press playing in the Pacific Northwest, but he\u2019s big (6\u20192\u201d 193 lbs) long (32.5\u201d arms) and noted for his agility and anticipation. We don\u2019t have combine numbers for him, but he looks loose and athletic with light footwork and good hand-eye coordination. Pete Caroll loves a big corner to coach up, so we got him one. \n\n**7.236 )  Cam Jones, LB - Indiana**\n\nAt this point in the draft, I decided to just take the most athletic and aggressive linebacker I could think of. A former wide receiver, Cam Jones is an agile and fluid linebacker with good acceleration and playmaking ability to go with a surprising amount of violence. He\u2019s a bit undersized and needs further development, but there\u2019s some real upside here to go along with obvious special teams potential. We\u2019re thin enough at linebacker that Jones could see work sooner than expected, especially on early downs.  \n\n\n**UDFA Signings**\n\n- Micah Baskerville, LB - LSU\n- Sean Clifford, QB - Penn State\n- Jack Colletto, FB/LB - Oregon State\n- Andre Jones, EDGE - Louisiana\n- Wayne Taulapapa, RB - Washington\n- Kearis Jackson, WR - Georgia\n- Jaylen Thomas, OT - Ball State", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "oldschoollogo", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u200b"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE DRAFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.05 )  Will Anderson, EDGE - Alabama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Requires no explanation.

He\u2019s a bit undersized and needs further development, but there\u2019s some real upside here to go along with obvious special teams potential. We\u2019re thin enough at linebacker that Jones could see work sooner than expected, especially on early downs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UDFA Signings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Micah Baskerville, LB - LSU&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sean Clifford, QB - Penn State&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jack Colletto, FB/LB - Oregon State&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Andre Jones, EDGE - Louisiana&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wayne Taulapapa, RB - Washington&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kearis Jackson, WR - Georgia&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jaylen Thomas, OT - Ball State&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11kw7aj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Seahawks/comments/11kw7aj/2023_rnfl_draft_mock_offseason_results_seattle/jb966l6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/11kw7aj/2023_rnfl_draft_mock_offseason_results_seattle/", "name": "t1_jb966l6", "author_flair_template_id": "51ccd272-71e5-11e4-a449-12313b0e450a", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Seahawks", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678186857.0, "created_utc": 1678186857.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/11kw7aj/2023_rnfl_draft_mock_offseason_results_seattle/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ryle", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "2023 /r/NFL_Draft Mock Offseason Results - Seattle Seahawks", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 11, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Seahawks", "link_author": "Caulibflower", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jb965rl", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Caulibflower", "num_comments": 14, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11kw7aj", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_6339b", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "(CREDIT: /u/AgustinCastor, Co-Director of Player Personnel)\n\n**FREE AGENCY**\n\n**Internal FA**\n\nIn this mock offseason a group of about a dozen or so agents handled any new contract that was proposed to an NFL player (outside of a simple restructure). That meant NFL players that were set to hit free agency, or wanted an extension, would go through an internal free agency period where offers were collected and negotiated with by real people. PFF\u2019s contract projections, historic trends, and a random dice roll that allowed the player\u2019s agent to value things slightly higher like location, ring-chasing, money, etc. The Seahawks addressed the QB, RB, LB, and S positions as well as depth in internal FA.\n\n**Trades**\n\nNo player trades were made during SEA\u2019s mock offseason simulation. Players like Tyler Lockett, Quinton Jefferson, Shelby Harris, Gabe Jackson, and Noah Fant were all considered as trade targets but ultimately the war-room decided Seattle would see more value returned from them on the field taking snaps in 2023, rather than take below-market compensation in a trade due to what was being offered. We did find that a veteran WR was needed by a lot of teams, so Lockett was inquired about frequently.\n\n**Restructures**\n\nAfter realizing Tyler Lockett\u2019s contract was not one that Seattle was looking to get out of, we decided to do a simple restructure and bring down his $16.8M cap hit for 2023 into just $11.1M. This saved $5.7M against the cap and increase Lockett\u2019s future cap hits for \u201824/\u201925 from $24M into $28.2M.\n\n**Extensions**\n\nSeattle was able to offer two extensions without much negotiating to Uchenna Nwosu and Shelby Harris. Nwosu was a no-brainer to attempt to extend. He\u2019s far exceeded his initial contract signed in 2022, and while we don\u2019t expect his extension to be this cheap in IRL, we hope SEA pursues this avenue. Shelby Harris was a more complicated situation. Early on our GM identified that SEA can create a competitive window in the near future and while Shelby\u2019s contract is primed for him to be released for massive cap savings, our war-room agreed he was a great player and we extended him at his average salary for cap relief.\n\n- Uchenna Nwosu: 2 year extension (total 3 year contract) | $39M total contract | $28M new money | $23M new GTD money | Year 1 cap hit reduced from $13M to $8.233M\n\n- Shelby Harris: 1 year extension (total 2 year contract) | $18.202M total contract | $6M new money | $4M new GTD money | Year 1 cap hit reduced from $12.202M\n\n**Re-signings/Tenders**\n\nWe had a total of 8 moves in internal FA, that saw multi-year re-signings and five restricted free agent tenders. I\u2019ll cover the re-signings and list the rest.\n\n- Geno Smith. The main story for the offseason, Geno accepted a three year, $108M total, $36M APY, $72M GTD contract. Includes a void year in 2026. All-in deal to commit to a top QB at market value cost. At the time of this writing Geno accepted a contract with IRL Seahawks that was only $3M off the total value. A piece of pride for our war-room. \n\n- Rashaad Penny. Penny accepted a one year, $3.8M total, $2.5M GTD contract.  He serves as cheap contingency depth at our RB position. Still looking for more help. This contract has $1.3M in incentives that are a mix between likely and not likely to be earned\n\n- Cody Barton. Barton signed a one year, $2.835M total, $1.98M GTD contract. Good depth and was seen as likely to start at the beginning of our simulation.\n\n- Tanner Muse. Muse signed a one year, $2.25M total, 300k GTD contract. Muse is an exclusive rights restricted free agent and can be brought in for $2.6M fully GTD but we were able to sign him to a contract with playing time incentives that has little money guaranteed.\n\nWe tried to sign Austin Blythe to a one year, $3.5M contract but a day after he signed, he retired IRL. Bad omen for us\u2026\n\nROFR Tenders: Ryan Neal [S]\n\nEFRA Tenders: G. Igwebuike [RB], Jon Rhattigan [LB], M. Jackson Sr [CB], M. Adams [DT]\n\nTop internal FA\u2019s that did not re-sign with the hawks in internal free agency: D. Lock, M. Goodwin, J. Abram, K. Fuller, B. Irvin, P. Hart, P. Ford, L. Collier, etc.\n\n**External FA**\n\nAfter exiting internal FA, the war-room knew we were likely working very little cap space due to the Geno contract and not much cap space in the first place. We initially targeted the center and LB position in FA and then tried to get bang for our back at RB and CB/EDGE.\n\nWe knew we had premium draft picks that we could rely to fill out the roster so bargain hunting became our biggest priority with the rest of our fund in external FA.\nWe had a total of 8 moves we made in external FA. 1 was considered high-impact, 6 moves were solid veteran signings with good experience, and 2 moves shored up position depth.\n\nHigh Impact Signings (1)\n\n- Evan Brown is signed from the Detroit Lions on a three year, $21M total, $8M GTD contract, with a \u201823 cap hit of $3M. Evan Brown has played 24 games in the last two years, 12 at center in 2021, and 12 at RG in 2022. He immediately slots in as our starting center and plus depth at RG should Haynes not perform as expected.\n\nSolid Veteran Signings (6)\n\n- Drew Lock returns to Seattle to backup Geno Smith on a two year, $4M total, $3M GTD contract that keeps him behind Geno for two years and provides, what PCJS see as, high ceiling at the backup QB position.\n\n- Marquise Goodwin also returns to Seattle on a one year, $2.5M total, $1M GTD contract. Goodwin served as a more than capable WR3 option in 2022. He comes back on a relatively cheap deal and helps SEA continue to have one of the best receiving corps in the NFL.\n\n- Ezekiel Elliott. Yes you read that right. Elliot gets cut by DAL after tagging Pollard in this sim and we scooped him up on a two year, $5M total, $3M GTD contract that is half the value of his current \u201823 cap hit with DAL spread across double the length. Coming of a strong decline in Dallas as a runner, his price was bargain basement. We intend to use Zeke as a replacement for Travis Homer - a rotational back who plays primarily on 3rd down, where we can apply his blocking and receiving skills, rather than using him as a bellcow. Thats not to say that he won't get reps on base downs with Walker and Penny - rather, he provides skills as a runner that neither have, and rounds out our RB room going into the draft. \n\n- Bruce Irvin was signed for veteran minimum to help bolster the Nwosu/DT, EDGE room).\n\n- Tyler Ott was signed for veteran minimum and we have no clue if he\u2019s okay or not after his season ending shoulder surgery on week 1 or 2. We didn\u2019t read up on it due to him being a long-snapper and re-signed him for nothing after negotiating with his agent twice.\n\n- Kyle Fuller signed for veteran minimum on the last wave of free agency to provide depth at center should our new addition of Evan Brown ever needs to slide out to RG or due to injury.\n\nPosition Depth Signings (2)\n\n- Jonathan Abram was re-signed to veteran minimum after the war-room decided they liked what he saw in 2022 when Abram replaced Neal due to injury. He\u2019s Strong Safety #3 on the roster but for the price, he\u2019s worth bringing back in solely for the scenario where Adams, Neal get injured. Maybe also provide depth at LB due to his frame.\n\n- Penny Hart was re-signed to veteran minimum to add to the WR room. In hindsight this was redundant due to how many WR\u2019s we have on the roster and his special teams role doesn\u2019t deserve a roster spot outside of being a camp body imo.\n \n**External Free Agency Summary:**\n\nWe missed out on free agents including Germaine Pratt (LB from CIN), David Montgomery (RB from CHI), Shaquille Griffin (CB cut from JAX), Frank Clark (EDGE cut from KC), and Bobby Wagner. The linebackers were targets that we went hard for but other players in the simulation signed for more than we were willing to spend. (PIT signed Pratt, DET signed Wagner)\n\nOverall we managed to bring back key internal free agents and continue to represent the Seattle Seahawks in missing out on the higher priced, marquee talents in waves 1 and 2 of Free Agency but grab values in the last wave.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "oldschoollogo", "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "\u200b"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(CREDIT: &lt;a href=\"/u/AgustinCastor\"&gt;/u/AgustinCastor&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Director of Player Personnel)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FREE AGENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal FA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this mock offseason a group of about a dozen or so agents handled any new contract that was proposed to an NFL player (outside of a simple restructure).
