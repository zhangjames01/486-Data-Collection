I got done for doing 109 on the open road a year ago and it was $60, which is way less than I  was expecting. Then just after xmas I got done doing 124 on the open road, and I thought I was fucked, but it was 'only' $170 which is a lot for me but I was assuming it would be twice that.\n\nSo what do you get for doing 60 in a 50?\n\nAlso, regarding the second question. Modern radar scanners in cop cars are little miracles, they can basically nail down your speed no matter what direction you are going, around a bend, in a group of cars, upside down, going in reverse etc. They are a long way removed from the old 'point and shoot' radar guns from the 1980s.

How much exactly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: never mind I saw your response further down. You were doing 71 lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask because I&amp;#39;ve been very surprised recently with the low fines I&amp;#39;ve gotten for speeding. I got done for doing 109 on the open road a year ago and it was $60, which is way less than I  was expecting. Then just after xmas I got done doing 124 on the open road, and I thought I was fucked, but it was &amp;#39;only&amp;#39; $170 which is a lot for me but I was assuming it would be twice that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do you get for doing 60 in a 50?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, regarding the second question. Modern radar scanners in cop cars are little miracles, they can basically nail down your speed no matter what direction you are going, around a bend, in a group of cars, upside down, going in reverse etc. They are a long way removed from the old &amp;#39;point and shoot&amp;#39; radar guns from the 1980s.
