I would have quit immediately.  Its a coop game where you play through \"normally,\" or its a building simulator that you play with Dev commands on.  Obviously you can play how you like, but I feel those are the two \"normal\" ways people seem to enjoy the game.  \n\nIts also 100% the type of game you want to play completely blind.  The moment you start looking at guides I think you cheat yourself of what makes the experience interesting, which is the mystery and exploration done alongside friends.  \n\nIn fairness to your comment, we def dropped the game a little before ER dropped because of the \"late game\" burnout.  When you have a GOAL and know there is something AFTER that goal, you can push and enjoy it, but once we got to the final boss each time and had the gear we wanted for said boss, we never even bothered to fight the boss for whatever reason...probably because at that point it was \"just fighting a boss\" left to do and the combat wasn't good enough to make \"and now go fight this boss\" be good enough of a reason to boot it up.  \n\nAlso, the content updates being free make it easy to warrant jumping back in every time they have a truely big update (like Mistlands... we'll probably hop on again when Ashland drops in...likely a yearish I would guess).", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it depends on your goals and if you are playing with people you know or not.

That is a lot (all things are relative), but it functioned as &amp;quot;spending time with family&amp;quot; as I played it with people in other states while talking on Discord.  Our goals were to just pick a weapon and armor set, max it or near max it, and go and fight the boss before moving to the next area.  We did some structural building for fun and spent time learning &amp;quot;the game&amp;quot; more early on, but generally it was about pushing from one area of the game to the next, at which point the grind wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad since there were clear goals in mind with immediate impact to the &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; itself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a solo experience?  I would have quit immediately.  Its a coop game where you play through &amp;quot;normally,&amp;quot; or its a building simulator that you play with Dev commands on.  Obviously you can play how you like, but I feel those are the two &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; ways people seem to enjoy the game.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its also 100% the type of game you want to play completely blind.  The moment you start looking at guides I think you cheat yourself of what makes the experience interesting, which is the mystery and exploration done alongside friends.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fairness to your comment, we def dropped the game a little before ER dropped because of the &amp;quot;late game&amp;quot; burnout.  When you have a GOAL and know there is something AFTER that goal, you can push and enjoy it, but once we got to the final boss each time and had the gear we wanted for said boss, we never even bothered to fight the boss for whatever reason...probably because at that point it was &amp;quot;just fighting a boss&amp;quot; left to do and the combat wasn&amp;#39;t good enough to make &amp;quot;and now go fight this boss&amp;quot; be good enough of a reason to boot it up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, the content updates being free make it easy to warrant jumping back in every time they have a truely big update (like Mistlands... we&amp;#39;ll probably hop on again when Ashland drops in...likely a yearish I would guess).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11dj14h", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/gamedev/comments/11dj14h/some_of_yall_live_in_a_fantasy_world_and_its_time/jab7xef/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11dj14h/some_of_yall_live_in_a_fantasy_world_and_its_time/", "name": "t1_jab7xef", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/gamedev", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677557722.0, "created_utc": 1677557722.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11dj14h/some_of_yall_live_in_a_fantasy_world_and_its_time/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_6iqyus", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I just beat Zhang Liang...", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "wolongfallendynasty", "link_author": "duidknight829", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ja5jfsv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "soenottelling", "num_comments": 75, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ja4v4li", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_imcb4", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I fought the first boss at lvl 4  and morale 10 and he felt \"right\" for a starter boss as in he felt difficult because I was learning how to play the game more so than he was particularly difficult.
