This method (a combination of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation and Raoult's law) is applied in [this](https://youtu.be/c8dDLe37ONg?t=139) Organic Chemistry tutor video in which is shown that the boiling point of NaCl solutions rise roughly (0.51*2 \u00b0C/molal)*(molality of the NaCl solution).\n\nBasically, it's very roughly a 2\u00b0C increase in boiling point per 100 grams of salt added per liter of water. However, once you get past the eutectic point of 23.3 wt% NaCl (see [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WatNaCl.png) phase diagram), most additional salt fails to dissolve.\n\nAccording to the nomagraph, I imagine with heat you could probably dissolve a bit more than 300 g of salt per liter of water to get a boiling point of around 106\u00b0C, but this will probably seem like a ridiculous amount of salt if you did this in a real kitchen.
