And to Ray&amp;#39;s father, the kind of guy who probably doesn&amp;#39;t give much credence to mental illnesses like depression or anxiety, he would simply see nervousness as weakness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically I think Ray&amp;#39;s father was saying &amp;quot;maybe you were just always weak, I didn&amp;#39;t make you that way&amp;quot;. But since they are in an afterlife limbo and/or near-death hallucination, he says it in a more &amp;quot;understanding&amp;quot; tone than he would in real life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3cavhn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TrueDetective/comments/3cavhn/s2e3_post_your_quick_questions_here/csvms70/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/3cavhn/s2e3_post_your_quick_questions_here/", "name": "t1_csvms70", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueDetective", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1436314770.0, "created_utc": 1436314770.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/3cavhn/s2e3_post_your_quick_questions_here/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tyoq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[S2E3] Post your quick questions here", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TrueDetective", "link_author": "teleekom", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "csv8ea9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Nonbeing", "num_comments": 1528, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_csuy1w4", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_85gm8", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Shotgun blasts go all over the place (well, if video games have taught me anything; I have no idea how accurate this is in real life).\n\nBut yeah, whether buckshot or rubber pellets, I'm pretty sure the spray is wide in diameter and doesn't neatly confine itself to one area.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shotgun blasts go all over the place (well, if video games have taught me anything; I have no idea how accurate this is in real life).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But yeah, whether buckshot or rubber pellets, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the spray is wide in diameter and doesn&amp;#39;t neatly confine itself to one area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3cavhn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TrueDetective/comments/3cavhn/s2e3_post_your_quick_questions_here/csv8ea9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/3cavhn/s2e3_post_your_quick_questions_here/", "name": "t1_csv8ea9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueDetective", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1436292909.0, "created_utc": 1436292909.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/3cavhn/s2e3_post_your_quick_questions_here/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34466", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Warner pulls Batman Arkham Knight from Steam", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "neogaming", "link_author": "Meremadesings", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "csihfx0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Nonbeing", "num_comments": 4, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_csict9y", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_85gm8", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; run away screaming from PCs\n\nThe Master Race is only growing in size as time goes on, is it not?
