The household is being charged to ensure that only those actually living in the area for which the local government is responsible are actually having to pay for it, rather than saying that the household itself actually incurs cost to the local government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I agree that it may make some poorer households worse off, but I think that it could be argued that sometimes, if people are receiving money (or not being charged money) that they ought to be then the right thing to do is to make a change and work out what to do from there. Some people might be worse off for the change, but they shouldn&amp;#39;t have had that money in the first place, and other people have been covering the holes left by them. I&amp;#39;m not assigning blame, I just think that the argument of &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;ll make the poor worse off&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t always particularly compelling, especially if &amp;quot;the poor&amp;quot; shouldn&amp;#39;t have had that money to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1c3hzl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ukpolitics/comments/1c3hzl/under_30s_whats_your_perception_of_thatcher/c9d0rzn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1c3hzl/under_30s_whats_your_perception_of_thatcher/", "name": "t1_c9d0rzn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ukpolitics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1365689392.0, "created_utc": 1365689392.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1c3hzl/under_30s_whats_your_perception_of_thatcher/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhcv", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Under 30s: what's your perception of Thatcher?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ukpolitics", "link_author": "pingbear", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c9czufw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "firedine", "num_comments": 57, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_c9czja8", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4nazr", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "That would make sense if the only cost were in literally picking up the rubbish, but rubbish needs to be sorted, collected, moved around and disposed of.

This can be interpreted to mean many different things about the nature of the universe, especially relating to the existence of absolute position and speeds. HUC could mean for example, that out ideas of position are incorrect, as there are no such things as fixed positions (which is the view taken when talking about electron clouds etc). HUC could also mean that objects do have fixed positions, momenta etc, but simply that we can't know about them, due to the uncertainty (which has a minimum value, i.e. must exist). \n\nUsing the second interpretation, this could be used to say that it is impossible to know to an arbitrary level of accuracy the initial conditions of a system. \n\nNow, combine this with chaos theory, which (in an extremely abbreviated form) gives that a small change in initial conditions can give huge variation in final results.
