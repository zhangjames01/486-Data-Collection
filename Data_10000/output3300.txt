I wanted to share this video for those who are interested in IBLP in a broader sense. The Duggars are mentioned a few times, but I feel the bigger story is the cult itself. While I personally hope the Duggars find healing in their individual lives, there are so many other families who were hurt similar to theirs that I hope more people start seeing the patterns and point the bulk of the blame on the cult that enabled so much abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, my friend Lindsey has a very unique experience with IBLP that I think would be of interest to anyone who has looked into the cult. I hope our stories shed some light on IBLP and their role in all this abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10awyo9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/10awyo9/tiktokyoutube_creator_captain_dadpool_interviewed/j46omzz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/10awyo9/tiktokyoutube_creator_captain_dadpool_interviewed/", "name": "t1_j46omzz", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DuggarsSnark", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673623511.0, "created_utc": 1673623511.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://youtu.be/NI8emeOqY-8"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_fl4tn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Got an email from a Duggar's publicist", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 7, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DuggarsSnark", "link_author": "CCMcC", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j3td6sh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Arch_Radish", "num_comments": 172, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j3t392p", "score": 7, "author_fullname": "t2_bp1r7", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks for the shout-out, and excellent analysis!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the shout-out, and excellent analysis!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_108gvm1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/108gvm1/got_an_email_from_a_duggars_publicist/j3td6sh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/108gvm1/got_an_email_from_a_duggars_publicist/", "name": "t1_j3td6sh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DuggarsSnark", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673391306.0, "created_utc": 1673391306.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/108gvm1/got_an_email_from_a_duggars_publicist/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r3nd", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Bham has a pretty lovely food scene.
