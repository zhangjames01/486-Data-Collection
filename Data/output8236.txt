The movie Too Many Husbands is playing in the background now and I've smoked about a half pack of cigarettes since getting up at 8.  \n\nMy first girlfriend cheated. Best friend, New Years, with me passed out next to them. Separately, they both told me the next day.  \n\nI've never had a better situation than that. \n\nSecond major girlfriend. Cheated with best friend. Then, we got back together, and what? oh yeah, I later found out she cheated with at least two other 'friends'. Then, one day, while living with me, simply left. No note, no call, didn't hear a thing for a year, then when I saw her, she said nothing. I still wonder what the hell happened. \n\nI met my future ex wife.  I kept an eye on her for five years, then married when I felt she was safe. One day, years into marriage, things felt 'off', and I asked her what was going on.  She said \"nothing\", and then I installed a hidden caller ID unit, as well as one she knew about. (Back in the day, when it was a new thing.)  I discovered that she was cheating with an employee/friend of mine. \n\nOnce I discovered that she was deleting phone calls, I hooked up a recorder.  One day I came home while she was working (Home business) and grabbed the recorder and listened.  \"Don't act like you like me when we go out tonight.\" among other things.   Barf.  The worst was hearing her tone of voice. I realized I hadn't heard that happy tone in a long time. \n\nA thirty year old man ran around the neighborhood like his hair was on fire. He ran so hard, so fast, and if anyone saw him they probably thought he was insane.  I'm quite sure he was, I just needed to do something other than break things.  \n\nI didn't know what was going on for sure so, I hired someone to follow her (Yep,  stalker move.) and told her that I had a meeting and wouldn't be home until late.   When the PI called, he told me the hotel they went to, and that there were 'rhythmic motions' coming from the car prior to entering the hotel. (The tracking device the PI had me install had a sensor for that too.)  Lovely.\n\nI was livid. I confronted her.  (He was on the way to our home to go out with us, and I had 'seen' myself letting him in the door, then hitting him with a baseball bat.  I didn't, or I probably wouldn't be here now.)  \n\nWe talked and she said she was sorry and that it wouldn't happen again.  Instead of her quitting, she started seeing him whenever she wanted.  It was terrible.  I didn't want a divorce, I wanted to have my life back. I was not prepared for this. I flat freaked the fuck out.  Day by day, I just kept trying/hoping it would work out.\n\nThis went on for almost three years.  It was hell. I couldn't (wouldn't, whatever.) let go.   I became a super stalker, and after a year, I started cheating too.  There probably isn't a trick that I didn't use to find out what she was doing.   It was like, if I didn't have proof, she would say that she wasn't doing anything.  It was ridiculous. I was ridiculous. I still am.  The sweet girl I was 'dating' didn't even hear me when I explained that I still wanted my marriage to work out.  \n\nI couldn't tell you the number of times that I'd say something like \"Where were you?\" and she'd lie, and I'd say \"No, you were 'here', and you parked 'here' and 'did this'.  Fools, both of us. What was the point? I even used my 'girlfriend' to spy on her.  Barf. What a fucking jerk.\n\nMy dad had gone through a lot of problems with his business, and long story short, he had placed everything he owned in my name.  His business, his properties and even his home.  Fearing the divorce would cost him half of his assets, I transferred everything back into his name, and started another business.  Meaning to become a less desirable target. \n\nI'm still a less desirable target, ten years later.  Without me, dad made a few bad decisions and had some serious bad luck, and he's currently in debt so bad that there's no way it will ever get better.  Me too.\n\nNext girlfriend, cheated with a close friend, whom I had just spent about a week with while helping him with the loss of his father.  I used to run into them at our old favorite bar, where he would drunkenly apologize to me.  She never did. They're married with kids now.\n\nNext girlfriend, cheated with a coworker of hers.  \n\nCurrently, I'm dating someone who was dating someone else when I met her.  I'd been single for five years and when she contacted me through an old aol profile, I thought, what the hell, I guess I'll be the other guy for a change.  \n\nI didn't expect I'd be dating her five years later.  I also didn't expect to almost lose my home or that I'd have to use her in order to save it.  Now, she owns my home.  A while back I caught her webcamming with an old fuck buddy.  Then, a few weeks ago we had lunch, and then she said she was going to go to the mall.  She didn't.\n\nAs I was heading back to work, I saw her drive past the mall exit.  I didn't say anything, she could have been going to a preferred gas station, or whatever.  Days later, we ended up in an argument about something stupid, and for whatever reason, she said \"You don't trust me.\"   \n\nThat's when I lost it.  I said \"You're probably right, you know why? Here's an example of why I might not:  Remember last week when we had lunch, and you said you were going to the mall?  Well, you missed your exit.  Where did you go?\"\n\nShe tried to lie, and kept trying to lie, then finally told me it was someone she used to see when she was dating someone else (A fuckbuddy) but that there was nothing going on.  Pretty much the same story as the webcam guy.  (\"I just thought it would be hot.\"))\n\nSo, I'll be 45 in about a day, \"my\" home is in my girlfriends name, and I'm dealing with a level ten cheater who might even be sneakier at evading detection than I am at detecting.  Especially considering that over the course of five years, she's heard most of my stories about such matters.  \n\n(example of her sneakiness: Her boyfriend thought she was cheating, so one day when she said she was going to a movie in order to see me, she had me drive to a theater and bought a ticket, for proof. A new trick, to me.)\n\nShe says she loves me, and desperately wants to get married.  She's actually tried to ask me.  \n\nWhat am I going to do?  Fuck if I know.  I'm hoping for a lottery win.  (I never have spare cash to buy tickets.)  Frankly, there's been a couple days I just thought I'd take my fastest vehicle and run it into a wall, but I'd never do that to my parents.  \n\nI'm so sorry for your situation.  I wish I could do something more than commiserate, or share stories.  I guess, if nothing else, you can see what kind of results you get from actions like mine.    \n\ntl;dr: A)  I'm a maladaptive, broke, jaded, cheater magnet with stalker tendencies. \nB) Don't let this happen to you.\nC) FML\n\nOh, and if you're on the west coast, I can probably help you find a cheap car or keep whatever you find running.  \n\nI'll tell you the same thing my dad told me one day:  Son, I'm broke too, but I'm broke on a whole different level than you, I'm helping *you* because I can't help *myself*.
