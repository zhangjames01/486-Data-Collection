At the very least, consider trying to find other parent friends to interact with, because I think you&amp;#39;ll find that boredom with your children is not actually that uncommon, especially when they&amp;#39;re so young. I should make it clear that I don&amp;#39;t have children but in the last few years I&amp;#39;ve begun having conversations with my mom and grandmother and friends who have kids about the decision to have kids and the timing and that sort of thing, and most of them including my mom and grandma were happy to go back to work and needed their time away from their kids and babies. Loving them doesn&amp;#39;t mean wanting to be with them all the time or not enjoying your own life and work and hobbies, and I think it&amp;#39;s a shame that we tend to expect mothers to sacrifice themselves willingly and happily because their kids have to be the center of their world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4a640x", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4a640x/i_dont_love_my_daughter/d0xt9r0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4a640x/i_dont_love_my_daughter/", "name": "t1_d0xt9r0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TwoXChromosomes", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1457836850.0, "created_utc": 1457836850.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4a640x/i_dont_love_my_daughter/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r2jt", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Hate myself for not being thin anymore after eating disorder/groomed by gross pedophile, does anyone else relate?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TwoXChromosomes", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d0xsjzt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Lil_Boots1", "num_comments": 10, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_4a6l53", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4vpkq", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you aren't already seeing someone, this is an issue that really warrants professional help.

She was 38 when I was born and 41 when my brother was born, and she was never unable to keep up with us because of it, whether it was hiking or sports or whatever. On the other hand, my dad was much younger and he missed out on a lot because he was working so much. He even literally missed an entire year because a temporary transfer lasted longer than planned and we had to move without him, and now he's still fairly young but because he's never taken care of his health, he's in worse shape than my mom was at his age and she's still up for most things although she's starting to slow down a little. \n\nAnd at this point, since I'm working on a PhD, which means about 70-80 hours a week in the lab lately, I'm planning on being an old mom because I'd rather be an old mom than an absent one. Yeah, I'll still be working and I'd like to have a pretty high-powered career, but there's a significant difference between the amount of time you have to spend at the bench as a grad student or post doc or beginning researcher and as an established professor. I'm not saying this is the only way to do it, and I have grad student friends who have kids who are making it work, but sometimes it's the best choice for you and only you and he can decide that for yourselves. Mostly I wanted to address the idea you both seem to have that being an \"old parent\" is inherently bad or less ideal, because it's a valid option and for many of us it's even the preferred option for lots of reasons.\n\nBut I think there are more important questions than how old you're going to be when you have kids. How are you guys going to handle the location situation if his residency isn't near your school? Are you planning on working after you have kids, whenever that may be?

She was 38 when I was born and 41 when my brother was born, and she was never unable to keep up with us because of it, whether it was hiking or sports or whatever. On the other hand, my dad was much younger and he missed out on a lot because he was working so much. He even literally missed an entire year because a temporary transfer lasted longer than planned and we had to move without him, and now he&amp;#39;s still fairly young but because he&amp;#39;s never taken care of his health, he&amp;#39;s in worse shape than my mom was at his age and she&amp;#39;s still up for most things although she&amp;#39;s starting to slow down a little. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at this point, since I&amp;#39;m working on a PhD, which means about 70-80 hours a week in the lab lately, I&amp;#39;m planning on being an old mom because I&amp;#39;d rather be an old mom than an absent one. Yeah, I&amp;#39;ll still be working and I&amp;#39;d like to have a pretty high-powered career, but there&amp;#39;s a significant difference between the amount of time you have to spend at the bench as a grad student or post doc or beginning researcher and as an established professor. I&amp;#39;m not saying this is the only way to do it, and I have grad student friends who have kids who are making it work, but sometimes it&amp;#39;s the best choice for you and only you and he can decide that for yourselves.
