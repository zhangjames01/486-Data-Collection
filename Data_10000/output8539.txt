It's really not that hard to understand. I45 at Edgebrook has few places to cross the freeway. To the north, the next closest crossing is Airport, which is about a mile north. To the south, the next is Alameda, about 1 1/4 miles. \n\nLet's say you're at the Del Mar Apartments and want to go on foot to the Spec's across the freeway. [Here's what that walk looks like.](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Spec's+Wines,+Spirits+%26+Finer+Foods/Del+Mar+Apartments,+10909+Gulf+Fwy,+Houston,+TX+77034/@29.6367859,-95.2396639,16.71z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x86409779ff3f96ff:0x1aa395fec7b911b1!2m2!1d-95.2372422!2d29.6337938!1m5!1m1!1s0x86409779b94a1355:0xc82ae3f3ec9c363!2m2!1d-95.2363841!2d29.6365598!3e2)\n\nGoogle says this is a 22 minute walk, but reasonably it would be 25-30 minutes, as you have to consider the time to get through two stop lights, and the stoplights in Houston aren't timed with pedestrians in mind.\n\nThe whole area is also designed such that pedestrians are clearly an afterthought:\n\n* You're going to be walking along a narrow, overgrown sidewalk just inches from traffic. \n\n* At the intersection, you're going to have to dodge vehicles zipping through slip lanes and the roundabout lane at high speed without looking at the sidewalk.\n\n* All along your walk, you have to constantly look out for vehicles entering driveways at high speed without bothering to check the sidewalk. \n\nThe alternative, just hop across the freeway. There's no fence or wall, only a low concrete barrier in the middle. Doing so turns a 25 minute trek into a short 300' jog. Oh, and that 25 minute walk is one-way. You have to do it again on the way back.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm  really not sure which is more dangerous. Sure, you have to dodge traffic, but if you go the long route, you're going to have to constantly dodge traffic entering driveways, making turns without looking, etc. At some point, if you're going to be dodging traffic anyway, you might as well just walk straight across the highway and save yourself some time. At least on the highway, you'll be directly in front of any car that might hit you, so they'll be able to clearly see you. You still might get hit by an inattentive driver who is texting while driving or similar. But still, you're far more likely to be noticed than trying to navigate the gauntlet of driveways and the lethal intersection. \n\nAdditionally, while crossing the highway is obviously illegal, people walking long distances must consider the risk of police harassment. Police like to stop and harass anyone who is simply walking down the sidewalk, particularly if they're a racial minority. Interactions with police carry their own time cost and monetary risk, plus their own lethality risk. Walking a mile down a lonely poorly lit sidewalk late at night? Well, remember, to legally murder you, a police officer only needs to state that, at the time, they believed you were a danger to them. Make a wrong move, try to pull something out of your pocket in a way that makes them nervous? That might cost you your life.  \n\nSo yes, it's really not hard to see why some people choose to just hop across the freeway. Doing so can save them up to 45 minutes to an hour of time. Plus, it's debatable whether taking the legal route or the illegal route is actually more dangerous. Crossing the highway is a short period of high risk. Walking the long way is a long period of moderate risk. Someone who walks frequently only needs so many close calls and near-misses at driveways and intersections before they decide \"fuck it. I'll just cross the highway and save myself some time.\" \n\nFinally, one last benefit of just jumping the highways is you have to deal with less driver harassment. Anyone who has walked or biked extensively in Houston knows that you will often have to deal with assholes honking at you just minding your own business going down the sidewalk or riding in a bike lane or right hand lane. There's a fair number of sociopaths out there who just love to terrorize anyone that dares to go around on anything other than four wheels. Walk a few miles down those freeway sidewalks, and you will get honked at, be yelled at by passing motorists, or even have trash thrown at you. This is doubly so if you're a racial minority. \n\nAll in all, it's really not surprising why many decide to just hop the freeway and get it over with.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just look at a map.

Well, remember, to legally murder you, a police officer only needs to state that, at the time, they believed you were a danger to them. Make a wrong move, try to pull something out of your pocket in a way that makes them nervous? That might cost you your life.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yes, it&amp;#39;s really not hard to see why some people choose to just hop across the freeway. Doing so can save them up to 45 minutes to an hour of time. Plus, it&amp;#39;s debatable whether taking the legal route or the illegal route is actually more dangerous. Crossing the highway is a short period of high risk. Walking the long way is a long period of moderate risk. Someone who walks frequently only needs so many close calls and near-misses at driveways and intersections before they decide &amp;quot;fuck it. I&amp;#39;ll just cross the highway and save myself some time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, one last benefit of just jumping the highways is you have to deal with less driver harassment. Anyone who has walked or biked extensively in Houston knows that you will often have to deal with assholes honking at you just minding your own business going down the sidewalk or riding in a bike lane or right hand lane. There&amp;#39;s a fair number of sociopaths out there who just love to terrorize anyone that dares to go around on anything other than four wheels. Walk a few miles down those freeway sidewalks, and you will get honked at, be yelled at by passing motorists, or even have trash thrown at you. This is doubly so if you&amp;#39;re a racial minority. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, it&amp;#39;s really not surprising why many decide to just hop the freeway and get it over with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11r7itj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/houston/comments/11r7itj/what_is_up_with_pedestrians_crossing_the/jc875gj/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/11r7itj/what_is_up_with_pedestrians_crossing_the/", "name": "t1_jc875gj", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/houston", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678839149.0, "created_utc": 1678839149.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/11r7itj/what_is_up_with_pedestrians_crossing_the/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r4b9", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Why is the alt-right all too happy to threaten the murder of all trans people?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 49, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "asktransgender", "link_author": "jacobrogers256", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jc5v6jv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "isleepinahammock", "num_comments": 219, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jc5e2h8", "score": 49, "author_fullname": "t2_50zof", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;What are they going to legislate against us?\n\nYou're not thinking with the evil creativity a Republican politician will use:\n\n* Start attacking asexuality, as an unnatural and delusional state of being. \"Wanting sexual intercourse is the most natural thing there is.
