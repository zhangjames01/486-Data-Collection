He (maybe) cheated on his ex. (Doesn&amp;#39;t sound like cheating to me but really only he and his ex know for sure.)  Assume the worst, he cheated on his ex.  Ok. So what? &amp;quot;Once a cheater always a cheater,&amp;quot; is stupid nonsense.  People learn from their past mistakes and many change.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, any one could cheat on you.  One of the risks of dating is having your heartbroken, and one of the ways that happens is by cheating.  You can&amp;#39;t eliminate that risk - no matter what you try - and you are far better off figuring out how you want to handle it if and when it happens to you rather than living in fear of it.  It could happen to you, no matter what you do. (I mean don&amp;#39;t date untrustworthy people, and don&amp;#39;t be stupid about it but don&amp;#39;t get so caught up in the fear that it keeps you from the joy of dating.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;third the thing in here that concerns me is that he gets overly jealous and threatens suicide.  Both of those are huge red flags - they suggest controlling behavior in a way that is likely to tip into abuse.  This could be him being a teen and still figuring shit out, and it could be him being over dramatic because he thinks it&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s supposed to do, but it could also be a serious problem.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were you, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;d talk to him about.  If he can&amp;#39;t tamp down on his jealousy and knock the suicide threats of entirely - that&amp;#39;s a thing you should be worried about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_wcwr9z", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Advice/comments/wcwr9z/did_my_boyfriend_cheat_should_i_be_worried/iif4f52/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wcwr9z/did_my_boyfriend_cheat_should_i_be_worried/", "name": "t1_iif4f52", "author_flair_template_id": "9a312b9c-6c83-11e9-9b67-0e6ea0218808", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Advice", "author_flair_text": "Helper [3]", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1659296686.0, "created_utc": 1659296686.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#e4e9f2", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/wcwr9z/did_my_boyfriend_cheat_should_i_be_worried/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3p", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[deleted by user]", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "sex", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iic9043", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "law-talkin-guy", "num_comments": 4, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wcf14l", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_ez8hq", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Have you been able to get there on your own?  \n\nIf not, that's the first step - take some time on your own to figure out what works for you, experiment, relax, have fun with it.
