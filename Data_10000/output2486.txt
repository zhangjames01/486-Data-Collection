Again, this is much easier to do on repair jobs, but it is an option if you can't find an single color to match. Obviously, you'll need to be able to accurately measure the well-mixed stains for you to be able to recreate the color on a larger scale.\n\nAlso, like others have said, the topcoat will affect the outcome, too.  I've also been able to match the sheen of a weathered floor by mixing flat and gloss topcoats together.  Just takes some experimentation.\n\nHere's a photo of a few Minwax stains on red oak.

You\u2019re both supposed to go past each other then turn, so you\u2019re not blocking each other\u2019s view. If you do this, 9 times out of 10 the person looks at YOU like you\u2019re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;North Carolina doesn&amp;#39;t dictate how to properly make this kind of turn. In my Driver&amp;#39;s Ed here in Raleigh (40 years ago, mind you), we were specifically taught to hug the edge of the median when turning from a dedicated turn lane (don&amp;#39;t cross over the other car). This goes for U-turns or making left turns. I looked at the current NC Driver&amp;#39;s Handbook, and it no longer provides the illustrations that it used to have on proper turning procedures. They used to illustrate pretty much every type of encounter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing--- the &amp;quot;proper way&amp;quot; is different from state to state.  As far as &lt;a href=\"https://yourfamilyfinances.com/2018/05/31/dont-take-driving-lessons-from-facebook/\"&gt;this source states&lt;/a&gt;, Delaware is the only state that specifically cites your method.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, since I noticed you might be from Texas, I found this interesting news segment from &lt;a href=\"https://abc13.com/dangerous-driving-problems-u-turns-techniques-houston-traffic/589504/\"&gt;ABC13 in Houston&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;If there are turn lanes for cars to queue up, then you hug the median.&lt;/strong&gt;  But in most states, there is no distinction about whether there is a dedicated turn lane.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_nrfy85", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/raleigh/comments/nrfy85/how_many_of_yall_know_that_its_the_law_to_have/h18mhxs/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/nrfy85/how_many_of_yall_know_that_its_the_law_to_have/", "name": "t1_h18mhxs", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/raleigh", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1623295876.0, "created_utc": 1623295876.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/nrfy85/how_many_of_yall_know_that_its_the_law_to_have/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[deleted by user]", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 8, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "pics", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gycv3qw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "astrosushinut", "num_comments": 2279, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gyc6x4q", "score": 8, "author_fullname": "t2_camub", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Go Heels!", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go Heels!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_ndr82n", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/pics/comments/ndr82n/deleted_by_user/gycv3qw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ndr82n/deleted_by_user/", "name": "t1_gycv3qw", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1621192970.0, "created_utc": 1621192970.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ndr82n/deleted_by_user/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xh58", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "A hanging heron, found by a Brazilian family, patiently awaits while a thread is untangled from its nozzle", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "HumansBeingBros", "link_author": "GusSzaSnt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gvm4wbv", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "astrosushinut", "num_comments": 752, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gvjk151", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_camub", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Back in the 80s, I volunteered to assist the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service to count Osprey eggs and nestlings on Lake Mattamuskeet, near Swan Quarter, NC.
