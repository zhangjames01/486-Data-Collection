I'm assuming that distraction still has its place when you acknowledge how you're feeling and choose to continue on with your day anyway as to not ruminate on it?  \n  \nI use distraction as more of an umbrella concept here - I'm actually trying to infer how we shut parts of ourselves off and distance from emotion.  \nSuppression, avoidance, distraction *can* be useful **short-term** mechanisms, such as closing off to an unsafe person in our environment. But it's really unhealthy to stay there for long. As I've mentioned, regulation is more about being able to go about your day without shutting parts of yourself off; until you can bring yourself back to safety.  \n  \n  \n&gt; Thank you random internet person! If you don't mind me asking, how did you come to learn these things? Trial and error, therapy, discussions with others, etc.?  \n\nI'm happy to share what I know. I see too much of a lack of it in our culture, and there's no point in just sitting on this stuff. What helps me can help others, and a lot of issues in today's society are completely resolvable if the majority of people have the right education. And one more person with the ability *and* experience to understand this stuff can go along way if I can't force-update peoples' knowledge like how we get these stupid new windows updates.    \nI learned this through a long process of trial and error, research in my own time while trying to understand myself, and eventually improving my knowledge and understanding enough to be able to find better resources. I only realized I had trauma 2-3 years ago. But I had a history of sporadic research in philosophy, psychology and even spirituality for a decade before that, and figuring myself out helped all the relevant information from that time come together more easily.    \nIt's not a method I would recommend to anyone. I just have a particular brand of stubbornness combined with the ways my past has affected me that has led me down my own road, which has its benefits and its costs.  \n  \n&gt; Sometimes I feel like mindfulness conflicts with other strategies like CBT. In CBT, if a thought makes you feel bad, you check the rationality or usefulness of that thought, and take action from there in order to no longer feel bad. In mindfulness, it seems like you don't attempt to stop feeling bad and just let yourself feel it. Sometimes I'm afraid that in just letting myself feel something, I'm missing an opportunity to correct the thought that caused it, such as if it's a harsh and critical thought towards myself. How do you know when to correct a thought, and when to just feel what you're feeling?  \n  \nWhen it comes to mental health strategies, no size fits all.  \nCBT has never been a good fit for me. It always felt like I was trying to fool myself, and it makes more sense now as to why I felt that way when trying it.  \nI believe CBT is good for people whose *thinking* is actually the problem. But if another core problem is what's affecting your thinking, do you think addressing the thinking is going to resolve anything?  \nI absolutely *detest* people who suggest positive thinking as a solution for me. And people who confuse the way my self-work affects my behavior and emotions with my personality. Ugh. Ugh!  \nAnyway. Pete Walker's book that I mentioned delves into the inner and outer critics within us that arise as a result of our struggles, and does have some strategies in working with that.  \n  \n&gt; For years I've been very resistant to mindfulness because in my teen years, it was often the only therapeutic strategy offered to me, and offered at inappropriate times when my environment wasn't safe, and it wasn't safe to be in the moment. I learned to hate it. A few years ago when I began seeing my current psychologist, I told her that if I had a dollar for every time a mental health professional suggested mindfulness to me, I'd have enough money to afford a therapy that actually works. The word 'mindfulness' still makes me cringe, but I'm trying to be open to utilizing it in my life now that I'm in a safer environment, and now that it seems to be relevant to what I'm dealing with. I'm beginning to see its value, but those in therapeutic roles really need to learn to discern when introducing mindfulness would be appropriate or inappropriate.  \n  \nSee, Mindfulness means many different things to different people. The way you were exposed to mindfulness wasn't appropriate for you, so you learned it was a shitty thing, and that's completely fine.  \nFor me, mindfulness for me didn't work either. I hadn't learned to feel safe in my body, and I didn't understand that. I didn't even realize at the time that my baseline for life was a lack of emotional/social safety. Nobody who advocated for mindfulness really had a good explanation that made it make sense, until I understood what was going on with me and why, and how I needed to approach things in order to recover.  \nWhat I do is try to connect with my body. That's the seat of where trauma is stored (The Body Keeps The Score, Bessel Van Der Kolk), that's our connection to our emotions - in our bodies. To do that, I have to work myself toward where I am, I have to reduce the barriers between myself and what's going on in my body right now. That helps me be present. That helps me come back to safety. That helps my body reach a restful, safe state where it's not constantly activated in some form of stress or reactivity, where it can actually recover and process things outside of sleep.  \nDo I need to describe that as mindfulness? No, I don't. Can I? Yeah. It's up to you. Find what works for you, the things that bring you back to the moment and feeling a little less distracted, a little closer to how you actually feel rather than caught up in your head or divided against yourself. You'll be more present by the very nature of this work, because you'll be less divided against the way you feel now.  \nThat is essentially mindfulness, at its bare bones, without all the other crap attached to it :)  \n  \n&gt; What constitutes actual emotional harm? Can this come from inside you/raw emotions? I.e., is there ever a good reason to be afraid of your emotions or thoughts?  \nThis is surprisingly complex. \nWhile I think the very core of emotion comes from an honest, genuine and helpful place, emotional harm can still come from both inside you and outside of you. Repressed emotion is cumulative, and can reach harmful levels to ourselves and others. Humans are social creatures, and we *do* need support and connection from others. It's tied into our survival.  \nTherefore people can harm us emotionally, but we can also harm ourselves - although this is debatable, because how much of internalized emotional harm is actually sourced from external contributors?  \nPhysical traumas also carry a powerful emotional component. If there wasn't, it wouldn't affect us as much. The line between physical and emotional abuse is much thinner than people think. People hardly realize how emotional we *all* are, and in fact we are more emotional than we are logical - but it takes insight to start seeing that.  \n\nWe can chase pleasure to temporary fill the hole of a need that was never met, or cover up the pain we have, while never resolving anything. Addiction has its roots in trauma - there is emotional implications to that, too.  \n  \nI think there are good reasons to be afraid of our emotions or thoughts. Things can build up to a point where they overtake our logical facilities - again, because our emotional systems are literally designed to override our rational systems - and people we care about can get hurt or something stupid can cost us our lives or quality of life.  \nThat's why it's so important to actually build these skills in regulation, coping, tolerance, processing - so that things just aren't constantly being piled into the background where we have less access and less awareness to be able to manage them the way we want.  \nIf you're familiar with the concept of The Shadow (Carl Jung), everyone has things that lie unacknowledged within them. And the only way we can bring balance to that is through accepting that they're a part of us and integrating them into ourselves, and while that's a scary thought at face value, the funny thing is that they can do more damage as long as they're in the darkness because we don't have access to them. They subvert our awareness and so we're subject to the push and pull of all the things we've pushed away. It's why a lot of abusive and toxic people do abusive and toxic things.", "edited": 1678623557.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will find you need to make time and space to just ride out these things, without distraction - otherwise it gets stuck and remains unresolved.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this context, are you talking about distraction with the intent of avoidance?

People hardly realize how emotional we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; are, and in fact we are more emotional than we are logical - but it takes insight to start seeing that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We can chase pleasure to temporary fill the hole of a need that was never met, or cover up the pain we have, while never resolving anything. Addiction has its roots in trauma - there is emotional implications to that, too.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think there are good reasons to be afraid of our emotions or thoughts. Things can build up to a point where they overtake our logical facilities - again, because our emotional systems are literally designed to override our rational systems - and people we care about can get hurt or something stupid can cost us our lives or quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;\nThat&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so important to actually build these skills in regulation, coping, tolerance, processing - so that things just aren&amp;#39;t constantly being piled into the background where we have less access and less awareness to be able to manage them the way we want.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you&amp;#39;re familiar with the concept of The Shadow (Carl Jung), everyone has things that lie unacknowledged within them. And the only way we can bring balance to that is through accepting that they&amp;#39;re a part of us and integrating them into ourselves, and while that&amp;#39;s a scary thought at face value, the funny thing is that they can do more damage as long as they&amp;#39;re in the darkness because we don&amp;#39;t have access to them. They subvert our awareness and so we&amp;#39;re subject to the push and pull of all the things we&amp;#39;ve pushed away. It&amp;#39;s why a lot of abusive and toxic people do abusive and toxic things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zpjo39", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Mindfulness/comments/zpjo39/my_handling_of_anxiety_and_uncomfortable_emotions/jbx5qzf/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/zpjo39/my_handling_of_anxiety_and_uncomfortable_emotions/", "name": "t1_jbx5qzf", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Mindfulness", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678623069.0, "created_utc": 1678623069.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/zpjo39/my_handling_of_anxiety_and_uncomfortable_emotions/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rhel", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "My handling of anxiety and uncomfortable emotions is robbing me of positive experiences.

I have two thoughts and I'm interested to hear yours. Firstly, we know that sometimes people are punished for feeling a certain way. For whatever reason, someone might scold you for feeling anxious/whatever about something, and you learn that feeling that way is unacceptable, and that feeling it will result in punishment. Secondly, maybe people learn to fear intense emotions if they feel they don't know how to safely handle or express them, and it results in them or someone else being hurt, such as self-harm or impulsive behavior. In neither of these cases is the emotion the direct result of harm.  \n  \nI touched on this a little earlier in this reply, but I think it's most common during attachment in childhood. In early childhood, there is little way for children to communicate with their caregivers their needs. Their caregivers must be attentive and supportive.  \nThere is a wide variety of things that can influence this (attachment theory is a good topic for it if you want to research more), but one example of something that can go wrong is if the child is crying to express a need that is unmet, and the need is only met when they are not crying - they learn that not crying is key to their continued survival.  \nHumans have multiple needs that each tie in with survival. Physical, Emotional, Social. There may be more, but that's how I think in terms of umbrella definitions. If each of those is unmet, it can threaten survival. Just as you can deprive someone of food, you can also deprive them of love. And it can be equally damaging.   \nConditional love, for example. If the child is required to meet a certain condition in order to gain love and affection from their caregiver, then that is what they learn. And that condition may be not exhibiting a certain emotion or set of emotions, or having to meet the caregiver's needs instead. It can be something as simple as having to ask for love - which might seem simple, but in fact conditional love cannot substitute unconditional love. \nSometimes a child must 'grow up too quickly', and emotions can jeopardize the functioning required in order to do so.   \nIt can also be deepened by our socialization and cultural beliefs. We all have to hide parts of ourselves around various people. This ties in with Carl Jung's concept of The Shadow, something I consider quite important.  \nBut some of us have had harsher experiences than others. If there were issues in the attachment phase of childhood, other issues can have a cumulative effect.  \nEven if secure attachment was developed, I suspect it would still be possible for traumatic experiences, cultural beliefs and emotionally unsafe social connections, especially during child to adolescent years, to develop a lack of safety with accessing one's emotions fully.  \nAfter learning quite a bit about these topics, I was surprised to actually recognize how common emotional invalidation and dismissiveness actually was. many people lack understanding of themselves and their emotions, and self-sooth or self-gratify themselves through power or superiority games, manipulation and a variety of other behaviors.  \nSome things I've experienced lead me to warn you that the vulnerability that comes from working on your trauma may invite people to take advantage of those unmet needs, fears, wounds. And it's not always obvious. The scariest manipulation out there is positive rather than negative, and may never look intentional. The best defense against that is coming to terms with and taking ownership of those parts of you that are vulnerable, understanding those needs and vulnerabilities and the desire to fulfil that by something outside of yourself.  \n  \n&gt; I suspect that this isn't what you meant, but my anxious mind interpreted this as \"if you're feeling anxiety, that means you're not safe, and you have to ruminate until you fix it\". What do you mean by, \"if we don't feel safe, we aren't safe?\".  \n  \nYou're right, I didn't mean it that way.  \nI was trying to refer to the difference between something like a physical threat in comparison to an emotional threat. Our survival systems are all tied together, and just as a physical threat is valid and something you *should* feel concerned about, so is an emotional or social threat. Both are equally valid, and both are equally important.  \nAs I mentioned before, rumination doesn't address the underlying emotions so long as the real situation remains unchanged. It can be a form of dissociation that brings us away from regulation and the connection to our bodies.   \n\n&gt;&gt; It's not trying to feel safe, it's showing your body that it can feel this instead of avoiding it. And if it's suppressing or avoiding something, it's showing it that that's ok too; because you're developing trust and safety with your emotions, and that means your survival instincts too.  \n\n&gt; I'm struggling to see how this would play out practically. I thought we concluded that suppression/avoidance is unhelpful or not \"ok\". Do you mean respecting/not fighting your body in the fact that it has tried to respond with that, and then choosing not to engage in the suppression/avoidance? You say it's not trying to feel safe, but isn't that ultimately what we're trying to teach our body/feel?  \n  \nThat's the thing about understanding your survival responses. They exist for a reason. They're trying to protect you. Yes, they can be a bit misplaced due to our harsh experiences. But we don't teach our body that it's safe by *avoiding* those responses. If your anxiety is trying to protect you from something, ignoring that or repressing it won't show our bodies that it is actually safe. Only by working *with* the response the same way as our other emotions can our body learn that *\"Oh hey, this isn't so scary after all!\"*  \nDoes that make sense?", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I feel that I&amp;#39;m gaining more clarity and making more progress here than I have in a while, but I always feel suspicious of that feeling because so many times, I&amp;#39;ve thought I&amp;#39;ve been on the right track, but it has once again just been avoidance disguised as acceptance, and I feel discouraged every time.

Of 4. Yep!**  \nHey there, so I know I'm months late at replying and not sure if you're still interested in hearing it but I said I'd get back to you so I wanted to stand by that. Hopefully the formatting isn't too bad to read.    \n\nI've taken so long to reply as I've hit a hard time between working on my own stuff and interpersonal challenges reinforcing the stuff I'm trying to work on, adding up to one big mess of an underwater rollercoaster.  \nThat and the fact that it's undermined my motivations in that it gets harder to start to tackle an organized lengthy response to a comment of a complex topic (despite still wanting to).  \nI didn't want to respond while I was in struggleville, and while I'm still there I feel like my understanding has developed in a number of significant areas and if I wait for a perfect time to get back to you, it could be years.  \n  \nAnyway, I hope things are going as well as they can be with you and that I didn't leave you hanging in a rough spot.  \n  \n---  \n  \nTo answer this question early:  \n&gt; Would you mind clarifying what you're referring to when you say \"survival response\"?  \n  \n\nA survival response is anything your body kind of does to try and protect you from something. Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn responses (Pete Walker, Surviving to Thriving book that I think I mentioned last time) Anxiety is typically a protective response. Dissociating from emotions and/or difficult or overloading situations (even positive ones) is a protective response. Healthy anger is typically seen in establishing and enforcing boundaries, but can also become more extreme if required as a survival response. There's many, many forms.  \n\n \n\nSo, to try and continue the conversation - I've advocated for acceptance of emotions. And while I do stand by that, sometimes it's more important to think of acceptance as more of a result rather than an action. If you have trouble seeing your own emotions as valid and well-placed, then you won't be able to force yourself to accept them. You'd just be working against a barrier that hasn't been addressed.  \nTo take the old adage \"What lies in the way, becomes the way\", this is when we need to turn our attention to what the barrier is, and work with that instead. This is a good rule to remember.   \nI've been finding it helpful to put emphasis on trying to examine how our emotions are actually dedicated to helping us as if they're their own independent entity within us, much as our immune system protects us independently. \nWhen you feel anxious it is helpful to try and think \"What is my anxiety trying to tell me? What is it trying to protect me from? What is it trying to keep me safe from?\"  \nIt's still important to work with the feeling rather than against it, and you don't have to figure it all out. It can be just knowing that your nervous system is trying to protect you or keep you safe by generating a fear response due to something it perceives as a threat. That is well-intentioned and benevolent, and sometimes being on our own side and understanding that the emotion is coming from somewhere real that is actually trying to help us rather than undermining us can keep our head above the water.  \n \nPart of the problem with being divided against our own emotions is that we tend to rely on that divide to keep us safe, as we never really learned how or lost the ability to regulate ourselves *with* emotion, and so we don't have any safety developed in feeling things.  \nWe normally develop a healthy, safe relationship with our emotions during healthy and supportive upbringing from our attachment figures - If this didn't happen properly, if it was unsafe to feel or express things or you lost that due to other traumas, due to the way parts of our brain develop at different rates, this can allow a distinct split to remain between our 'functional' side and our 'emotional' side.  \nI haven't finished it yet but I've been reading *Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors* by Janina Fisher, and it describes this well. Might be worth a peek so see if it seems relevant to you - it's a pretty well-regarded book particularly with dissociation.  \n  \nAnyway, this divide between the functional part of us and the emotional part of us forces us more into our own heads rather than into the here and now, and interferes with our connection to our bodies. It keeps us functional, but causes us an array of issues because we were meant to function as one integrated whole. It is however comforting to know that this disconnect can be worked on and these issues don't have to haunt us our whole lives.    \nTo answer your question about what emotions look like when they become intellectualized - it's difficult to explain in depth, but the simplest example is rumination. An emotional experience pushes us into our heads, often leading to a cycle of thinking that's difficult to escape from.  \nPart of why this happens can be because we can't effectively cope with the emotion, so we escape away into our own minds, creating distance from the emotion. But because we can't think ourselves out of that emotional experience (our survival brain is literally designed to override our rational brain), we get kind of trapped trying to intellectually solve it. This can also present as daydreaming - much the same way only you're disconnected more from the emotional side.  \nIt's common for repressed emotions to present as anxiety even if we can't recognize why we're feeling it - due to that disconnect.  \n  \n&gt; This has arguably been the most difficult part to wrap my head around. Whenever trying to implement a healthier response to my uncomfortable emotions, I couldn't fathom how I wasn't just once again falling into avoidance under the guise of acceptance, because at the end of the day, the point of those healthier strategies is to reduce suffering, right?  \n  \nThat is a very understandable thing to grapple with. I'll try and explain my understanding which has helped me with the same.   \nIt is a healthy response to avoid pain. But if we see our emotions as something that causes pain, rather than the factors that are provoking those emotions, we are reinforcing the idea that our internal state is a threat to escape from. Part of the issue here is that we need access to that internal state to be able to process, resolve and integrate emotions and experiences. Remember that our survival system is designed to override our rational brain - so if it detects our internal state as a threat and pushes us to escape from it (dissociation, distraction, avoidance, repression) then not only does this leave the original cause of the emotion AND the emotion itself unresolved, but it also provokes additional anxiety about *feeling* that way. Here we can see how it creates a negative feedback loop (much like the infinite redstone loop) that threatens to drown us every time it gets triggered.  \nNow, a common misconception is that good coping and regulation feels good too. In reality, it's more feeling those struggles but not being *overwhelmed* by them, or falling into dysregulation. It's like being emotionally in pain but still being able to go about your day.  This is why we need to change our approach to emotions to start moving in accordance with them, because division lends itself to dysregulation.  \nAgain, it's normal to not want to feel that discomfort - but remember that acceptance of our emotions is about *feeling* them, not *escaping* them. It's spending time giving them space to breathe in the space where you are. Reminding yourself that you can feel these things and still be ok. It's listening to the signs and signals our body is giving us - if we're feeling shaky, let your body be a bit shaky. Maybe even exaggerate the shakiness to help it - your body is just trying to regulate itself and help you!      \nIt's the connection to our emotions that allows us to work with them and move ourselves toward regulation, and being in this state allows for more processing, integration and resolution of emotion rather than having it stuck in these loops or brought forward every time something linked to the repressed emotion triggers it.  \nI hope this all clarifies the difference better, and it is a very important part of regulation and processing. But we need to build something else on that too.  \n  \nSo to reiterate, being more in touch with our bodies/feelings and being able to regulate ourselves (or stay within our window of tolerance, where we might be hurting but aren't overwhelmed) is the first step that our bodies are looking for in order to rebuild our safety with feeling. This is very much a relationship that you build on with yourself and your own body.     \nThe second step is being able to move our bodies back into a regulated state. The best thing you can do after spending some time in discomfort is return to a feeling of safety. This may not be a *completely* safe feeling, it's ok if the best you can aim for is *safe enough*. That can be sitting down somewhere quiet, somewhere neutral, familiar or comfortable, or doing something you like. It's a place where you can set the discomfort down, a place where you don't have to feel on edge. \n\n It takes time, and there's a lot of back-and-fourth - again, it's building the relationship with your own body, just like it's another part of you that's trying to help you, just like your immune system. Your body wants to be in balance, and it's great to know that it will actually help you. We just have to start moving in accordance with it rather than against it.", "edited": 1678623740.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1... Of 4. Yep!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nHey there, so I know I&amp;#39;m months late at replying and not sure if you&amp;#39;re still interested in hearing it but I said I&amp;#39;d get back to you so I wanted to stand by that. Hopefully the formatting isn&amp;#39;t too bad to read.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve taken so long to reply as I&amp;#39;ve hit a hard time between working on my own stuff and interpersonal challenges reinforcing the stuff I&amp;#39;m trying to work on, adding up to one big mess of an underwater rollercoaster.&lt;br/&gt;\nThat and the fact that it&amp;#39;s undermined my motivations in that it gets harder to start to tackle an organized lengthy response to a comment of a complex topic (despite still wanting to).&lt;br/&gt;\nI didn&amp;#39;t want to respond while I was in struggleville, and while I&amp;#39;m still there I feel like my understanding has developed in a number of significant areas and if I wait for a perfect time to get back to you, it could be years.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope things are going as well as they can be with you and that I didn&amp;#39;t leave you hanging in a rough spot.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer this question early:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Would you mind clarifying what you&amp;#39;re referring to when you say &amp;quot;survival response&amp;quot;?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A survival response is anything your body kind of does to try and protect you from something. Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn responses (Pete Walker, Surviving to Thriving book that I think I mentioned last time) Anxiety is typically a protective response. Dissociating from emotions and/or difficult or overloading situations (even positive ones) is a protective response. Healthy anger is typically seen in establishing and enforcing boundaries, but can also become more extreme if required as a survival response. There&amp;#39;s many, many forms.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to try and continue the conversation - I&amp;#39;ve advocated for acceptance of emotions. And while I do stand by that, sometimes it&amp;#39;s more important to think of acceptance as more of a result rather than an action. If you have trouble seeing your own emotions as valid and well-placed, then you won&amp;#39;t be able to force yourself to accept them. You&amp;#39;d just be working against a barrier that hasn&amp;#39;t been addressed.&lt;br/&gt;\nTo take the old adage &amp;quot;What lies in the way, becomes the way&amp;quot;, this is when we need to turn our attention to what the barrier is, and work with that instead. This is a good rule to remember.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve been finding it helpful to put emphasis on trying to examine how our emotions are actually dedicated to helping us as if they&amp;#39;re their own independent entity within us, much as our immune system protects us independently. \nWhen you feel anxious it is helpful to try and think &amp;quot;What is my anxiety trying to tell me? What is it trying to protect me from? What is it trying to keep me safe from?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\nIt&amp;#39;s still important to work with the feeling rather than against it, and you don&amp;#39;t have to figure it all out. It can be just knowing that your nervous system is trying to protect you or keep you safe by generating a fear response due to something it perceives as a threat. That is well-intentioned and benevolent, and sometimes being on our own side and understanding that the emotion is coming from somewhere real that is actually trying to help us rather than undermining us can keep our head above the water.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem with being divided against our own emotions is that we tend to rely on that divide to keep us safe, as we never really learned how or lost the ability to regulate ourselves &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; emotion, and so we don&amp;#39;t have any safety developed in feeling things.&lt;br/&gt;\nWe normally develop a healthy, safe relationship with our emotions during healthy and supportive upbringing from our attachment figures - If this didn&amp;#39;t happen properly, if it was unsafe to feel or express things or you lost that due to other traumas, due to the way parts of our brain develop at different rates, this can allow a distinct split to remain between our &amp;#39;functional&amp;#39; side and our &amp;#39;emotional&amp;#39; side.&lt;br/&gt;\nI haven&amp;#39;t finished it yet but I&amp;#39;ve been reading &lt;em&gt;Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors&lt;/em&gt; by Janina Fisher, and it describes this well. Might be worth a peek so see if it seems relevant to you - it&amp;#39;s a pretty well-regarded book particularly with dissociation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this divide between the functional part of us and the emotional part of us forces us more into our own heads rather than into the here and now, and interferes with our connection to our bodies. It keeps us functional, but causes us an array of issues because we were meant to function as one integrated whole. It is however comforting to know that this disconnect can be worked on and these issues don&amp;#39;t have to haunt us our whole lives.&lt;br/&gt;\nTo answer your question about what emotions look like when they become intellectualized - it&amp;#39;s difficult to explain in depth, but the simplest example is rumination. An emotional experience pushes us into our heads, often leading to a cycle of thinking that&amp;#39;s difficult to escape from.&lt;br/&gt;\nPart of why this happens can be because we can&amp;#39;t effectively cope with the emotion, so we escape away into our own minds, creating distance from the emotion. But because we can&amp;#39;t think ourselves out of that emotional experience (our survival brain is literally designed to override our rational brain), we get kind of trapped trying to intellectually solve it. This can also present as daydreaming - much the same way only you&amp;#39;re disconnected more from the emotional side.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt&amp;#39;s common for repressed emotions to present as anxiety even if we can&amp;#39;t recognize why we&amp;#39;re feeling it - due to that disconnect.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This has arguably been the most difficult part to wrap my head around. Whenever trying to implement a healthier response to my uncomfortable emotions, I couldn&amp;#39;t fathom how I wasn&amp;#39;t just once again falling into avoidance under the guise of acceptance, because at the end of the day, the point of those healthier strategies is to reduce suffering, right?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is a very understandable thing to grapple with. I&amp;#39;ll try and explain my understanding which has helped me with the same.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt is a healthy response to avoid pain. But if we see our emotions as something that causes pain, rather than the factors that are provoking those emotions, we are reinforcing the idea that our internal state is a threat to escape from. Part of the issue here is that we need access to that internal state to be able to process, resolve and integrate emotions and experiences. Remember that our survival system is designed to override our rational brain - so if it detects our internal state as a threat and pushes us to escape from it (dissociation, distraction, avoidance, repression) then not only does this leave the original cause of the emotion AND the emotion itself unresolved, but it also provokes additional anxiety about &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; that way. Here we can see how it creates a negative feedback loop (much like the infinite redstone loop) that threatens to drown us every time it gets triggered.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow, a common misconception is that good coping and regulation feels good too. In reality, it&amp;#39;s more feeling those struggles but not being &lt;em&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/em&gt; by them, or falling into dysregulation. It&amp;#39;s like being emotionally in pain but still being able to go about your day.  This is why we need to change our approach to emotions to start moving in accordance with them, because division lends itself to dysregulation.&lt;br/&gt;\nAgain, it&amp;#39;s normal to not want to feel that discomfort - but remember that acceptance of our emotions is about &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; them, not &lt;em&gt;escaping&lt;/em&gt; them. It&amp;#39;s spending time giving them space to breathe in the space where you are. Reminding yourself that you can feel these things and still be ok. It&amp;#39;s listening to the signs and signals our body is giving us - if we&amp;#39;re feeling shaky, let your body be a bit shaky. Maybe even exaggerate the shakiness to help it - your body is just trying to regulate itself and help you!&lt;br/&gt;\nIt&amp;#39;s the connection to our emotions that allows us to work with them and move ourselves toward regulation, and being in this state allows for more processing, integration and resolution of emotion rather than having it stuck in these loops or brought forward every time something linked to the repressed emotion triggers it.&lt;br/&gt;\nI hope this all clarifies the difference better, and it is a very important part of regulation and processing.

In our natural balanced state things just come up by themselves, we don't need to *do* anything to make that happen. It's the avoidance habits that we're trying to step out of here rather than *trying* to feel things, and ironically you can't do that if you're trying to escape your avoidance either. It's noticing it, spending time with it and not needing that to change either.  \nIt's actually difficult to explain conceptually, but there is a different feel to it that pops up when you develop it a bit more. It's the essence of mindfulness, really.  \nIt's important to just not force anything. Not force your will upon it, not grasp it with your mind to pull it this way or that.  \n  \n&gt; I keep thinking about an elusive day where I will finally be free of this problem, and I will be able to sit and think about how I'm feeling and truly just enjoy it without interruption from my thoughts and fears. Is this realistic?  \n  \nSomewhat.  \nIt's very realistic for you to be more in touch with how you feel with less pain or suffocation, and have better coping mechanisms and regulation skills. In many ways it's the aversion and blocks we have against emotion that causes the most pain.  \nYou won't get rid of the negative emotions, but they will be less suffocating. In a sense it opens you up to feel more. Which is both a good thing and a bad thing, but you also have the skills to regulate yourself better.  \nEmotions get processed and resolved rather than stuck, and if they get stuck you have a better idea of why, and how to approach it to move forward.  \nIt is realistic for you to reach a place where your thoughts and fears no longer overcome your emotional regulation, at least not on a hairline trigger. Not without good reason for them to do so.  \nThey will still be there, and things will be hard sometimes still, but you'll have tools to work with that and be subject to it less. \nI don't know the extent of what you have to work through.  \n  \n&gt; What am I actually working towards?  \n  \nThe overall goals here is to:  \nA) Work on our unhealthy coping mechanisms (suppression, avoidance, all the subtle things in between) in order to stop letting things go unaddressed and build up, and get ourselves more in touch with our emotions.  \nB) Work on the skills for better tolerance, coping and emotional regulation.  \n\nNot necessarily in that order, they kind of go hand-in-hand with each other.  \nYou feel something, you work *with* it. If a part of you suppresses that emotion, you work *with* that too.  \nHow you feel through this entire process is valid and ok; even the avoidance. You're not trying to chase anything you're not, you're trying to bring yourself in accordance with it, and developing your sense of safety in feeling that. It's not trying to feel safe, it's showing your body that it can feel this instead of avoiding it. And if it's suppressing or avoiding something, it's showing it that that's ok too; because you're developing trust and safety with your emotions, and that means your survival instincts too.  \nThis is how we balance ourselves out. We're trying to reduce the polarizations within ourselves, reduce the division against ourselves, so the various parts of who and what we are work together  better.  \n\n\n\n&gt; What should I expect through this?  \n  \nIt will be rocky. You will fluctuate, and sometimes rubber-band when you feel too much, which is normal - but it won't feel normal. Because you're going toward emotion, it will be scary and your system will freak out. That's ok; let it. It's just trying to keep you safe, trust it to. Look to your support if you need to, but try to be on your own side, your own friend too and talk to yourself the same way you'd want to be supported.  \nTrust your body and instincts like it's its own person. They see more than you think. Trust it to communicate to you what it needs, and trust that it comes from an honest part of you, even if it's perhaps misplaced. If doesn't know what your logic knows, it only knows how you feel.  \nYou will find you need to make time and space to just ride out these things, without distraction - otherwise it gets stuck and remains unresolved.  \nJust yesterday I had to just sit down away from distraction (phones, computer, people) and let my body sink into what it was feeling, and part of what helped process it was letting my body respond the way it wanted to (a good example of this is the muscular response in your core when you are sobbing/crying). It felt expressive rather than restrictive, and the intensity was reduced as a result. Don't expect that right away, it takes time to build that kind of safety in feeling, and you'll fluctuate along the way.  \nEmotions come in waves, and it's important to let it come and go - again, just like it's its own person, and make time for it to do so where possible.  \nIt is possible to reinforce trauma if you're in an unsafe environment and take on too much, so respect the limits your body presents, don't force anything.  \nSometimes emotion will become intellectualized and push you into survival responses again. Black and white thinking and catastrophising is common here, like 'This feels impossible', 'I don't know if I'll ever get better', there are many ways this can express itself.  And you'll need to work with yourself, thinking things like 'yeah, it feels that way and that's coming from somewhere valid, and maybe it's also influencing my thinking as a result.' That's ok to - it's a very *yes, and-* kind of process.   \nYou should expect it to be a learning process; you don't have to manage everything all from the start (it's a lot, I know; after a while of working on the little things it kind of moves into more of a muscle memory and you can expand from there). You'll figure things out as you work with it over time rather than all at once, as knowing something is very different to internalizing it.  \n  \nI found [this dissociation comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDNextSteps/comments/l42ts0/how_to_selftreat_dissociation/gklyueu/?context=3) to be helpful in a number of areas including some understanding as to why it takes a while; you might not realize how you dissociate (I didn't), but even then it has a lot of value.  \nYou will need to spend some time thinking about what triggers you after an event, because managing triggers and the emotions that comes with them is much easier and faster than drawing yourself out of a survival response.  \n  \n&gt; How will I know when it's not bothering me anymore?  \n  \nIt will be more manageable, feel better and you'll be less reactive. When you can work with this stuff without being pushed into a survival response. You'll be able to be more present rather than your mind trying to grasp every little thing, and you might even realize how the grasping of the mind ties into the anxious response.  \nIf a survival response does come up, that's ok, it's a valid protective response and you should listen to what it's telling you - you can work with that too. It takes takes longer and sometimes you'll need to move somewhere safe to help you reset and process some of the fallout.  \n  \n&gt; My point is - what is the ideal outcome here?  \n  \nThe ideal outcome is that you function more naturally as a person and individual, emotions and all.    \nThat's it. Sounds simple, right? But that's what balance is. You won't be divorced from the bad emotions, and you'll be better for it.  \n  \n&gt; I don't mean to imply that you have all the answers and can 'fix' my problems nor do I mean to pressure you in that way, but I'm resonating with your approach to this and it seems like something you've been on your own journey with and learned from, and I'm really appreciative that you're taking the time to share it with me.  \n  \nS'all good. I definitely don't have all the answers - I'm just a random internet person who has learned a lot in working on this stuff myself and want to share what has worked for me.  \nIt's possible what works for me might not work for you, and with working with trauma it's possible to make things worse. So take things slow, start small, work on the more manageable things, listen to what your emotions tell you - as they are good, honest indicators.

Sorry it's taken a while to get back to you. I'd partly written a response that needed both finishing and reviewing because it was too long, then travel and Christmas happened... etc.  \nSo it turns out I have a lot to say about this stuff. This will be the first part of a long ass 2-part response, but I'll put it out for you if you want to read anyway, no expectation. The second part will try and answer more of your direct questions, but it might take me a bit longer to finish that one after I send this.  \nApologies if I repeat myself a little, when replies get longer and more complex it's harder to keep track.  \n\nSo, here we go.  \n  \n-----  \n  \n\n&gt; Today I had an experience where I achieved something I was proud of, but then these thoughts and tension came up again, and I attempted to accept it, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed and robbed of positive feelings around this achievement, and frustrated. I just wanted to enjoy my achievement. Does that indicate that I wasn't truly accepting that uncomfortable feeling and that I was fighting with it  \n  \nI find it helpful to think about that situation this way. A part of you was proud of your achievement. That part doesn't just dissolve into nothing, it's still you, and it's still there somewhere. But another part of you had reasons to bring up those thoughts and tensions to the forefront, which whether directly or indirectly interfered with that sense of being proud.  \nNow you tried to accept that, but found a part of you felt disappointed and robbed of that feeling.  \nAnd that's valid too. It's ok to feel robbed of that. It's not about not feeling these things. Each and every thing you've noted is a real and valid way that the various parts of you are communicating things to you via how you feel.\nIf you're fighting with any part of that, you're fighting yourself. And if you think about what that means, there's now way you will ever feel better in that space.  \nOne of the key things to understand here is that there can be parts of ourselves that have conflicting feelings. But the source of those feelings are always something valid; even if they might be misplaced.  \n\nThat part of you that interfered with that sense of achievement might just want to protect you or fulfil a need that hasn't been met, even if it's sourcing its reasons from the experiences, traumas or neglect of our past that aren't happening now - because those things were never resolved or addressed, it never really stopped being a threat.  \nYou don't resolve that by running away from it, or suppressing it. Because then you lose access to it, and it gets stuck in the background.  \nAnd the only way to get access again is by showing your body and mind that we're in a better place to be able to feel those things without suppression or avoidance.  \nIt's worth mentioning there though that suppression and avoidance ARE valid protective mechanisms in the short-term where your immediate environment isn't safe. With enough progress you can start to trust your body to sort this out for you based on the situation, rather than just triggering a trauma response at a thought.  \nAlso be mindful in your efforts to accept things, as it's so easy to fall back into trying to accept it in order to get away from it, and then we're full circle back to avoidance. \n\n\n&gt; do I just need to accept that sometimes I will feel robbed of good experiences and that it will be disappointing?  \n  \nAll feeling happens in the present, in the body. And it's all information, a inner monologue of what's happening inside us if you will.  \nI've found the best way to treat emotions is like they're their own person. Except they communicate with you in feeling rather than words. This helps not 'grasp' emotions or try to control them so much and see them as the messages they are.  \nWhen feelings are processed through safe expression and even just by listening to and respecting them without getting in the way, they become resolved.    \nThis is a dynamic process, grounded in the body; not the mind. You don't have to preemptively manage whether or not you'll be robbed of a feeling. This is more of a mental grasping of a situation that doesn't exist outside your head.    \nIs it possible? Sure. But the more you bring yourself to be in accordance with that, how you feel and balance out some of these polarizations, the more space you'll have for good experiences, because that vague sense of mental grasping/tension (trying to control it) isn't getting in the way. Because you'll be less caught up in your head and more in your body; the root of all feeling.  \n\n\n&gt; It got me thinking about what we can reasonably expect to feel. In mindfulness, there's a theme of letting your emotions be and just letting yourself experience whatever comes up. But I have to admit, I think we all feel entitled to certain emotional experiences. I felt entitled to feeling good about my accomplishment.   \n  \nI think there's some substance in that. We should feel good about our accomplishments. That's only natural, right? But sometimes we have stuff that gets in the way of those feelings. Things that unbalance us in ways that completely mess with the natural way we work.  \nWe suppress the bad to protect ourselves but don't realize that it affects the good stuff, too. Your job isn't so much try to feel a sense of accomplishment, as that's just a natural result of accomplishing something - but to try and get in touch with the things that get in the way of that, and try and resolve those things.  \nTo try and move in accordance with the way you already are (which involves the emotions you haven't faced), rather than avoid or suppress those things.  \n\nAnd that's why we need to develop our emotional tolerance and better management/coping skills, so we can shave off little bits of that suppressed trauma so it doesn't overwhelm us as much.  \nThis is a delicate process, as if you have a high level of trauma you really need to respect the pace your body sets out for you or you can risk retraumatizing yourself (especially in a bad environment, which happened to me :P ). That's why I say to work on the manageable stuff, develop that trust with yourself. If it's too much that's ok, give yourself some time and space to recover and you can always come back to it later.  \n\n\n&gt; When I thought about taking a mindful approach and just experiencing whatever comes up, whether that's enjoyable or not, it just felt... bleak. As if I can't even count on positive experiences to bring me positive emotions. As if I don't deserve to feel good, or something.  \n  \nTo me, mindfulness at its core is to bring yourself into accordance with your environment. And your inner experience is a part of that environment. Also worth mentioning there is a zen aspect to it; not to force the mindfulness - it's already there with you, so it's about letting the environment come to you rather than trying to grasp it with your mind.     \nMindfulness can help us identify the things which prevent us from being in accordance with that (if you're subconsciously avoiding how you feel, you'll struggle to be present and grounded). All the little ways we aren't in accordance with ourselves are right there, in the way. This ties in with the old saying 'What stands in the way becomes the way'.    \nOften when it comes to trauma, we fall into instinctive habits of suppression and avoidance in order to survive, and this doesn't just affect what we're trying to suppress, but our entire emotional spectrum. We were never taught how to feel safe with how we feel or how to regulate our emotions, because it wasn't safe to feel those things or we never had the right teacher.  \nEmotional safety is as big as physical safety. It's all tied into our survival systems, it's the same with our social aspects. If we don't feel safe, we aren't safe. And if that emotion is never resolved, the threat or need never ends within our inner experience. That's trauma, an unresolved harsh inner experience.  \nThis can keep us in a constant baseline of survival response or threat assessment, and so it makes sense why it's hard to feel positive emotions when positive experiences happen.  \nAnd so we find ourselves later on in life trying to first understand then resolve these things, and we have to teach ourselves how to start processing the trauma, how to change how we handle emotions so things stop getting stuck through suppression or avoidance. To bring ourselves slowly, safely out of that survival response and build that safety and trust with ourselves so our survival response doesn't hijack us back every time.   \nIn many ways, mindfulness is navigating that journey. You don't just be mindful one day and boom, you're happy. It takes you down that road where the things that are blocking the way are on the path. Because they're parts of you that need to be heard and attended to; if we don't, we're not being present, and if we're not present, we're not mindful.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas for the other day! Sorry it&amp;#39;s taken a while to get back to you. I&amp;#39;d partly written a response that needed both finishing and reviewing because it was too long, then travel and Christmas happened... etc.&lt;br/&gt;\nSo it turns out I have a lot to say about this stuff. This will be the first part of a long ass 2-part response, but I&amp;#39;ll put it out for you if you want to read anyway, no expectation. The second part will try and answer more of your direct questions, but it might take me a bit longer to finish that one after I send this.&lt;br/&gt;\nApologies if I repeat myself a little, when replies get longer and more complex it&amp;#39;s harder to keep track.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here we go.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I had an experience where I achieved something I was proud of, but then these thoughts and tension came up again, and I attempted to accept it, but I couldn&amp;#39;t help but feel disappointed and robbed of positive feelings around this achievement, and frustrated. I just wanted to enjoy my achievement. Does that indicate that I wasn&amp;#39;t truly accepting that uncomfortable feeling and that I was fighting with it  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it helpful to think about that situation this way. A part of you was proud of your achievement. That part doesn&amp;#39;t just dissolve into nothing, it&amp;#39;s still you, and it&amp;#39;s still there somewhere. But another part of you had reasons to bring up those thoughts and tensions to the forefront, which whether directly or indirectly interfered with that sense of being proud.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow you tried to accept that, but found a part of you felt disappointed and robbed of that feeling.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd that&amp;#39;s valid too. It&amp;#39;s ok to feel robbed of that. It&amp;#39;s not about not feeling these things. Each and every thing you&amp;#39;ve noted is a real and valid way that the various parts of you are communicating things to you via how you feel.\nIf you&amp;#39;re fighting with any part of that, you&amp;#39;re fighting yourself. And if you think about what that means, there&amp;#39;s now way you will ever feel better in that space.&lt;br/&gt;\nOne of the key things to understand here is that there can be parts of ourselves that have conflicting feelings. But the source of those feelings are always something valid; even if they might be misplaced.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That part of you that interfered with that sense of achievement might just want to protect you or fulfil a need that hasn&amp;#39;t been met, even if it&amp;#39;s sourcing its reasons from the experiences, traumas or neglect of our past that aren&amp;#39;t happening now - because those things were never resolved or addressed, it never really stopped being a threat.&lt;br/&gt;\nYou don&amp;#39;t resolve that by running away from it, or suppressing it. Because then you lose access to it, and it gets stuck in the background.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd the only way to get access again is by showing your body and mind that we&amp;#39;re in a better place to be able to feel those things without suppression or avoidance.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt&amp;#39;s worth mentioning there though that suppression and avoidance ARE valid protective mechanisms in the short-term where your immediate environment isn&amp;#39;t safe. With enough progress you can start to trust your body to sort this out for you based on the situation, rather than just triggering a trauma response at a thought.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlso be mindful in your efforts to accept things, as it&amp;#39;s so easy to fall back into trying to accept it in order to get away from it, and then we&amp;#39;re full circle back to avoidance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;do I just need to accept that sometimes I will feel robbed of good experiences and that it will be disappointing?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All feeling happens in the present, in the body. And it&amp;#39;s all information, a inner monologue of what&amp;#39;s happening inside us if you will.&lt;br/&gt;\nI&amp;#39;ve found the best way to treat emotions is like they&amp;#39;re their own person. Except they communicate with you in feeling rather than words. This helps not &amp;#39;grasp&amp;#39; emotions or try to control them so much and see them as the messages they are.&lt;br/&gt;\nWhen feelings are processed through safe expression and even just by listening to and respecting them without getting in the way, they become resolved.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis is a dynamic process, grounded in the body; not the mind. You don&amp;#39;t have to preemptively manage whether or not you&amp;#39;ll be robbed of a feeling. This is more of a mental grasping of a situation that doesn&amp;#39;t exist outside your head.&lt;br/&gt;\nIs it possible? Sure. But the more you bring yourself to be in accordance with that, how you feel and balance out some of these polarizations, the more space you&amp;#39;ll have for good experiences, because that vague sense of mental grasping/tension (trying to control it) isn&amp;#39;t getting in the way.

I'm sorry :P )  \n\n&gt; I feel that anxiety (and I guess other intense negative emotions) threatens my emotional safety, and that's why I'm afraid of it.\n\nAt least as far as that statement goes, emotional safety to you means not feeling anxious, or any negative emotion.  \nThat may not be how you conceptualize it, but the core belief that exists in your disposition to these things (it's hard to describe the difference between the two, I hope that makes some sense).  \nI would ask you to challenge that definition, as well as the idea of 'good and bad emotions'. All emotions are just information, and even 'bad' emotions can be great to feel due to the cathartic release as you get better at this.  \n\nIt's easy to say, and absolutely hard in practice - but you can feel safe in feeling anxious. You can feel safe in feeling unsafe. Provided you are in the right environment, of course. If you have physical, emotional and social safety in your environment, the only roadblock is within you, which you can then work with (again, I want to highlight the term work *with*, rather than work *against*).  Conversely, if any of those types of safety is compromised in your environment (and it's not coming from trauma), you *should* feel that way. If you're not safe, you should feel unsafe, right? And that makes sense. The difference is you're not opposed to that feeling, because you know it's valid.  \n\nIt's not that this gives you the illusion of safety when you don't feel safe, but more of a inner confidence where you know you can feel this uncomfortable thing for however long it wants to take and still be ok in the end - that you can feel it and not be overwhelmed into a survival response.  \n&gt; Let's say someone's about to prick you with a needle. You know it's going to hurt. Aren't you afraid?  \n\nNot so much anymore. I may anticipate the pain and not want to feel it, which is a normal response. But I know I can feel that pain and be ok.  \nIt's worth mentioning this is not a conceptual resolution, but more a result of teaching my body over time that it's ok to feel these things by letting myself feel the negative side of it; letting it be a negative experience if it needs to be, rather than being polarized against feeling that way.  \nI've found from experiencing both sides, that the fear you are describing comes from a very highly intellectualized emotional/survival response, while the other side is based in a grounded sense of connection to your body, which isn't intellectualized but more of a baseline of the present moment that you have a feeling-sense of access to ground yourself amidst what's happening around you.   \n\n&gt; Anxiety feels painful, and therefore I fear it. I don't know any other way.   \n  \nDoes it make sense that this is a self-reinforcing cycle?  \nAgain, there's a difference here between internalizing that understanding, and understanding it (but understanding it is the foundation of the former). \nThe best way I can show this to you, is to ask you to just pinch yourself.  \nIt can be painful, right? Why doesn't it provoke anxiety? A sense of fear?  \nThe body knows it'll be ok. It just hasn't learned that this other form of pain is something that's ok to feel.  \nThe anxiety is sourced from our survival system, which at the end of the day is just trying to protect us and keep us safe. It's a friend to you. But your body never learned that for a variety of reasons, and this is why the key is to work *with* the anxiety.  \nAnd in this, *start small*. This is not a quick process, teaching your body to be safe in feeling these things.  Work on the manageable things and take note of their progress. \nIf something arises that is unmanageable (and it will), that's ok too. You don't *have* to manage it. You don't *have* to do all this feely schtuff. Just recognize that it's your survival system trying to protect you, and let it do its thing for as long as it has to, cos it's a natural (though misplaced because trauma) part of your function. You're allowed to be anxious.\n\n\nOnce you're in a survival response, it's more about trying to ground yourself in the body, which takes time. And to ground yourself in the body, you have to bring yourself in accordance with how the body *is*, whether that's being anxious or not.  \nIt's not about *not* being anxious. It's not about chasing a better feeling. Again, it's coming to terms with how you feel, trusting your body to communicate that to you rather than reaching for it yourself.  \nReaching for feeling is just another mental exercise that takes you out of the body and into the mind more, which is the opposite of grounding.  \nAnd the more your body feels safe, the more the emotions will start bubbling up where they aren't restricted, suppressed or suffocated, which safely express and resolve them. In many ways the resistance (whether deliberate or instinctive) to emotion results in the pain of emotion; not the emotion being painful itself. \n  \n  \n&gt; You say you don't need to \"do\" anything to accept an emotion. What about when your default state is to fight it, and you have to \"do\" something to...stop yourself from fighting it? Are you then fighting your own fighting, and is that a problem? The complexity and paradox of all of this makes me feel like I'm trying to imagine the fourth dimension.  \n  \nYes, it certainly seems like a paradox doesn't it? \nSo, your default state is to fight it. If you try and stop yourself from fighting it, you're still working against yourself. That's right!  \nSo what can you do?  \nYou see, you're still asking for a method to stop yourself from doing that. Which is the same thing.  \nNow, all this is very hard to keep in working memory, so throw it all out for now. \nFundamentally, your body only speaks in feelings, and can't pick up the logical thoughts you have. Emotional problems need emotional resolutions, not logical ones, which is why you can feel one way despite knowing better.  \nSo what message does your body get when you are fighting against the way you are? \"It is unsafe to be this way.\"  \nWhat message does it get when you say \"This is unhelpful to me, but it's just my survival system trying to keep me safe, and I don't need it to stop doing that.\"  \nIt takes time to *show* it that it's ok to feel that way, cos you have to show it through feeling, but it's this message that makes it think \"Oh hey, this isn't as scary as it was before. Maybe it's not so bad?\"  \nI know it seems complex. But it's also surprisingly simple. But in life it requires the greatest art to be simple. Your mind will want to grasp onto a problem and try to think its way out. But this doesn't work well with our instincts, because they're literally designed to override our logical mind. And that's how we get more mixed up.  \nIn a way verbalizing it as we are is intellectualizing it. But at the same time you might notice this as more of a dialogue that moves back and fourth, like an oscillation. And at the end of it you might be slightly more in balance with the way you are. And that's what the process is like, too.  \n&gt; This is a slight side note, but the difficulty I've had in understanding and overcoming this makes me wonder if I'm actually just not smart enough to do so, as if the wiring necessary is just not there in my brain. I don't know what to make of that, and I recognise it's probably not helpful.  \n  \nIf you weren't smart enough, we wouldn't be having this conversation. It wouldn't have even gotten close to this far.  \nIt feels hard, it feels difficult, because it is! It IS fucking hard! And there's a terrible beauty in that.  \nSo let it happen. Emotional problems need emotional resolutions.  \nIf you want some extra resources, I'd personally recommend The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, and Complex PTSD from Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker.  \nAnd some Alan watts talks for his perspectives on philosophy/spirituality, because he does touch on some of this stuff and it can be a good reminder.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in a rough spot today; I&amp;#39;ll try and give you a decent response but it might be a little disjointed or unorganized.&lt;br/&gt;\n(Or, like really long.
