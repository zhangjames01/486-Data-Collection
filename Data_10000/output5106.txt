With a Blink Dagger, it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to accidentally move in too close and then you&amp;#39;re out of position and die (particularly relevant to Shadow Shaman&amp;#39;s long shackle channel). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll want to keep an eye on your most important targets to disable, AS WELL AS the people most likely to kill you in fights. You&amp;#39;ll need to position safely, but still close enough to blink and get the enemy carry (as an example) when they jump your team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you blink in and cast a spell, it&amp;#39;s totally reasonable to walk away from the fight and hide again. Depends on the fight, but the Blink will come off CD around the same time your spells come off CD too, so stay alive and you&amp;#39;ll be able to Blink initiate again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to have Blink Dagger on a hotkey that is easy to press, but that you also don&amp;#39;t overlap with the finger that has to press Hex. So like if hex is on W and you press that with your ring finger, you may not want to put Blink Dagger on a hotkey that your ring finger presses too. The whole point is to Blink+Hex instantly, so the faster you can press both buttons the better, and it&amp;#39;s generally easier when you have them on say, F and W so two fingers press the respective keys with no down time of your finger moving between keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_lqp0cq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/lqp0cq/looking_for_recommendations_for_educational/golftz0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/lqp0cq/looking_for_recommendations_for_educational/", "name": "t1_golftz0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/TrueDoTA2", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1614183158.0, "created_utc": 1614183158.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDoTA2/comments/lqp0cq/looking_for_recommendations_for_educational/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tk78", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Looking for recommendations for educational content for supports", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 15, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "TrueDoTA2", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gohtu57", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "HeartOfTheSkittles", "num_comments": 8, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_lqp0cq", "score": 15, "author_fullname": "t2_dsnai", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hi, I'm ZQuixotix, support content creator!

I think 4 Jakiro does the same thing as 5, but with slightly more farm priority and you can choose damage over utility a bit more. But I think he has issues as a 4. Not a consistent laner depending on the match up. If he loses the lane, he can't really roam, and without levels he doesn't do much. He's slow so it's intimidating to contest pulls.

I think it&amp;#39;s pretty solid, but not strictly needed. So if I need other items, I go for those first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you get any items you NEED to have, if you don&amp;#39;t need anything else, you can grab the shard. Could be first item if you don&amp;#39;t need anything, could be second/third/fourth/etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like the shard when: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My team has trouble sieging high ground &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The enemy has a lot of tanky heroes &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I am doing very well&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pos 4 Jakiro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Depends on your bracket. I think 4 Jakiro does the same thing as 5, but with slightly more farm priority and you can choose damage over utility a bit more. But I think he has issues as a 4. Not a consistent laner depending on the match up. If he loses the lane, he can&amp;#39;t really roam, and without levels he doesn&amp;#39;t do much. He&amp;#39;s slow so it&amp;#39;s intimidating to contest pulls. I prefer 5 Jakiro for that reason, but if people don&amp;#39;t punish you, then you can get away with 4 Jakiro&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_ky4hie", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/learndota2/comments/ky4hie/how_to_play_jakiro_from_an_immortal_spammer/gjhf5r3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/ky4hie/how_to_play_jakiro_from_an_immortal_spammer/", "name": "t1_gjhf5r3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/learndota2", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1610819424.0, "created_utc": 1610819424.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/ky4hie/how_to_play_jakiro_from_an_immortal_spammer/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tta4", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How to play Jakiro from an Immortal spammer", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "learndota2", "link_author": "HeartOfTheSkittles", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gjhcqgk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "HeartOfTheSkittles", "num_comments": 34, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_gjggtsu", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_dsnai", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "A build I've been going lately is Tranquils&gt;Soul Ring&gt;Support Item.
