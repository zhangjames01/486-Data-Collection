What is happening in our world? And what news are we watching? Why is it that there are five major news channels and they are all controlled by the same people? \nWhy is everybody fighting? Why is everybody so tense? How do we reconcile?\n\nBecause the biggest conspiracy was that after Jesus the man died - they built a story about him and started charging admission.\n\nAfter editing out all parts of the bible they didn't like and sticking in laws to control people that don't make sense. All Jesus was and represents is love - why would he be against homosexuals or anything that is positive and feels good?\n\nWant to know one of the first Gospel's edited out? It was with the Gospel of Thomas and it was about Jesus's divinity. Jesus denied ever being divine and kept trying to show people that inside themselves is God. He also believed in re-incarnation and that part was taken away too so we'd be good little scared boys and girls and pay our taxes.\n\nNow if Jesus believed in re-incarnation and that part was edited out - who wrote and chose to include what's in the book that so many people are thumping nowadays? The same ones that run the corporations, the same ones that run the police and the same ones that run the government and the same ones that control the media.\nDo you see - follow Leonardo D'Vinci's intuition and his incredible rebellion against the catholic church - he believed each man was divine and I believe Jesus did too. Take the number 666 - when we dream the symbols are often inverted - so 999 - now look at that in the mirror just like D'Vinci's writing - it looks like PPP\n\nPoliticians Priests Police\n\nThe real anti-christ and the **greatest** cover - up. That's why you should care that Jesus was a historical figure - because he was just a man and his own revelation enabled him to defeat death. Peter, the rock upon which the Church was founded was the original lobbyist - he pushed the Roman Empire to accept a perverted - corrupt - and edited doctrine which then spread like a cancer everywhere because it's a perversion of Jesus's earlier message.\n\nLook at Edward Snowden right now and compare what you know of Jesus and what you know of him. Look at the two biggest whistle-blowers! Compare the media, the politicians and the banks to the mighty Leviathan with many heads (5 major news agencies all owned by the same people) the illusion of choice in our society. They're coming for Snowden with everything they got but this time - people have access to the real message and won't be corrupted.\nWhat if Jesus was for homosexuality - for brotherly love - what if he was for plural marriage - what if he was for human connection in any way that was positive because he understood we were all a mixture of these things inside.\n\nThink about when you were children - the first time you masturbated and learned about your genitals was with others of the same sex. Now add to that memory the guilt that comes with Christianity - (Not the true teachings) and realize how cancerous it is. All men are bisexual to a degree, all women are too - when we are honest with our feelings and ourselves we become more like Jesus because he dropped all pretenses.\nThis last week was life changing for me. I was an Atheist until about two days ago and now Jesus is back in my life - not as a god or some divine being - but a great example of a great man and how to treat the rest of the world.\n\nI was finally honest with my wife and admitted cheating on her early on in our relationship - she confessed to lusting after other women and men. I did too. We were for the first time like children before each other - sex was just a good feeling and there was no guilt. We cried and found a happiness and closeness never before experienced.\nWhat if all the prophets were re-incarnations of Jesus. What if each culture had something to teach the world and we are too busy arguing about the right path to salvation. What if there is no hell? :) What if hell was just a made up place that they taught you so that you'd feel guilty for doing the things that were just biological and positive? What if Jesus wanted us to connect with everyone and everything?\nAfter all the revelations this week - the government really is watching you and pumping chemicals into the water to make you docile - fluoride was used in the concentration camps to keep prisoners docile.\nDo you ever wonder why you can't sleep? Why you feel irritable and tense? Because of this underlying guilt they have you by - the scared thought that you know you'll go to hell because you keep sinning - so you just consume consume consume to get rid of the fear and we praise our highest competitors.\n\nWhat if instead of praising competition, we praise cooperation and learn from each other. What if we learn the true message of Jesus - what if we can all read it for ourselves and not from some cherry-picked amalgamation of sources that the rich have always controlled. What if we just went through the apocalypse and judgement is at hand?\nWhat if there's too many souls in the world? We keep reproducing and reproducing - like a cancer that never stops because we were told that birth control is bad. Well all the souls are here - and the trumpets are blowing. (Whistle-blowers) Learn from the tree of knowledge and partake of that last awful sup.\nDrink shroom tea and meditate, you'll understand why they wanted you to never access plants that grow naturally and can help everyone understand their own divinity.\nWe are at the cusp of a real change of thinking. What if we reverse the geocentric theories of our minds and realize our consciousness is not limited to ourselves?\n\nNOW go pick up your bibles and read revelations in this context. Look at all the parts of it that don't make sense and truly ask yourself? Is this Jesus's word? IF Jesus believed in re-incarnation than I think we have to follow his advice from his later avatar - Buddha who said, \n\u201cBelieve nothing no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and common sense.\u201d\n\n**TL;DR:** [What if I told you](https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/p480x480/1013962_10101545790759880_403833080_n.jpg)\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus might be the original whistle-blower and I believe Snowden has something in him that&amp;#39;s part of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the news recently? What is happening in our world? And what news are we watching? Why is it that there are five major news channels and they are all controlled by the same people? \nWhy is everybody fighting? Why is everybody so tense? How do we reconcile?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because the biggest conspiracy was that after Jesus the man died - they built a story about him and started charging admission.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After editing out all parts of the bible they didn&amp;#39;t like and sticking in laws to control people that don&amp;#39;t make sense. All Jesus was and represents is love - why would he be against homosexuals or anything that is positive and feels good?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Want to know one of the first Gospel&amp;#39;s edited out? It was with the Gospel of Thomas and it was about Jesus&amp;#39;s divinity. Jesus denied ever being divine and kept trying to show people that inside themselves is God. He also believed in re-incarnation and that part was taken away too so we&amp;#39;d be good little scared boys and girls and pay our taxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if Jesus believed in re-incarnation and that part was edited out - who wrote and chose to include what&amp;#39;s in the book that so many people are thumping nowadays? The same ones that run the corporations, the same ones that run the police and the same ones that run the government and the same ones that control the media.\nDo you see - follow Leonardo D&amp;#39;Vinci&amp;#39;s intuition and his incredible rebellion against the catholic church - he believed each man was divine and I believe Jesus did too. Take the number 666 - when we dream the symbols are often inverted - so 999 - now look at that in the mirror just like D&amp;#39;Vinci&amp;#39;s writing - it looks like PPP&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Politicians Priests Police&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real anti-christ and the &lt;strong&gt;greatest&lt;/strong&gt; cover - up. That&amp;#39;s why you should care that Jesus was a historical figure - because he was just a man and his own revelation enabled him to defeat death. Peter, the rock upon which the Church was founded was the original lobbyist - he pushed the Roman Empire to accept a perverted - corrupt - and edited doctrine which then spread like a cancer everywhere because it&amp;#39;s a perversion of Jesus&amp;#39;s earlier message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at Edward Snowden right now and compare what you know of Jesus and what you know of him. Look at the two biggest whistle-blowers! Compare the media, the politicians and the banks to the mighty Leviathan with many heads (5 major news agencies all owned by the same people) the illusion of choice in our society.
