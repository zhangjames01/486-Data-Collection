And admittedly I'm spending waaaay too much time on this shit but I'm bored and people who anonymously post the \"Let me tell you how it is,\" stories when they clearly don't have a fucking clue and are talking out of their ass annoy the hell out of me so screw it this'll kill some time for me.\n\nOur hero opens to say the first time he went to jail it was over a, \"Mix up with an old traffic ticket.\" First off if we believe him that it happened we have to assume the \"mix up\" was that he didn't pay it and was 100% in the wrong, since he so fervently denied any wrong doing in the second incident but didn't deny anything in the first. But it's really unlikely you go to jail over one unpaid traffic ticket, if that's all you've got. It's not the movies where, \"Buddy you've got an unpaid eight over the limit...you're going downtown.\" Theoretically possible. But unlikely. More likely, especially if the only record you have is this traffic ticket you forgot to pay, the court suspended your license (which you got notified by mail of) until you pay the ticket and a fee to reinstate you license is paid. Then if you get caught doing something else after ignoring your suspension notice (there's a reason the cop looked up your license, they're not putting out a Dragnet over your unpaid failure to feed the meter), the cop is gonna give you a ticket for driving on a suspended license, which you'll then also have to pay with the other stuff to get your license back. Which you really should do at this point since you're now on chance three. That's basically how it works. No one is looking for that heroic nab of the guy who skipped his double parking fine. They have more important things to worry about. And as the guy pointed out traffic fines are basically about, well the fine. It's gonna cost them money to book you for your unpaid illegal U-ee. They just want you to pay the damn fine and move on.\n\nBut let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he got randomly assigned to the night court stickler he issued a warrant for him and then pulled over by officer cranky who looked up that he had a minor \"mix up\" with an old ticket and decided that despite him being polite and cooperative the cop thought it was worth his effort to do the paperwork and booked him anyways.\n\nLet's go to the second arrest. It was apparently over some unspecified license plate mix up this time. The guy's pissed because he's 100% sure he's right and this dumb woman cop is wrong. First he already knows he apparently lives in a town where you get collared for unpaid traffic tickets, so maybe you don't want to piss off police. And yet he decides to get in a \"scuffle\" with three of them. Now he's 100% right, and this lady cop is just a dumb woman, but he lives in a place that the ACLU made headlines across the country with because he calmly asked for an explanation as to why his plates were bad and all three cops on the scene were more ignorant of traffic laws than him and decided to make him pay for showing them up and accosted him. I don't remember that ACLU headline but maybe it happened, or maybe he thought RoK was a more legitimate source to air his grievance with this insanely corrupt police department or whatever. Let's say it happened. He definitely misused the word scuffle which implies short hurried physical struggle, and since he \"sat in the shit house for a couple of days,\" he wasn't charged with, \"assault or battery of a police officer,\" so we'll assume he had an verbal disagreement with the three cops and doesn't know what a scuffle is.\n\nWhat was this disagreement over? That he didn't agree with the ticket? Nope. The cops don't care if you agree with them or not. They can have you on video doing whatever it is you did wrong, show it to you, and you can still sit there and say, \"Didn't do it,\" and go have your day in court. Actually if he was so correct, court would have been his option to prove himself right. The disagreement was over him refusing lawful service. An expired tag or whatever on it's own isn't going to get you \"a court appearance.\" It will again get you a ticket/fine. So I suppose we're supposed to assume he didn't want to pay the fine, and didn't want to have to show up in court to prove how right he was.\n\nNow do cops make mistakes? Can they maybe even be outright incompetent, looking for quotas, or even just be assholes? Sure. They might want to make some quota or whatever. But what they're not looking to do is do paperwork to arrest some jackass over a minor traffic plate issue. You'd have to be acting a fool for that to happen. But by golly, this man was not going to be pushed around by anyone, so he acted a fool even though he knew not paying his speeding ticket got him a record so not cooperating with officers is definitely going to be a problem, but a second arrest over principle was worth it. \n\nLook, I think traffic cops can be annoying as hell sometimes. I'm sure going to court to demonstrate his infallible correctness would have been a pain in the ass, and he certainly didn't want to pay a fine he wasn't guilty of. What's the alternative though? We just say, \"Okay, look cops are the enforcers of the rules, unless you're *really* sure you did nothing wrong, then they have to let you go in any and all cases?\" Traffic cops are a bureaucracy, it can be a pain in the ass, but until we all have driver less cars or whatever we work with the system we've got. Be an adult and deal with that. Take the legally given ticket and either suck it up, roll your eyes and pay it or go have your day in court. I hate bureaucracy's, I hate toe over the line traffic line enforcement as much as the next guy. But don't make a mountain out of a molehill by refusing to cooperate with police over a traffic stop. It's called being a member of society to just accept sometimes you've got to deal with said bureaucracy so the cops have the capability to control a situation when the stop is over \"murder-rapist guy\" and not \"Oops my plates are expired man.\"\n\nBut dammit, let's move on to his jail time because he wasn't going to be pushed around by anyone. Let's first pause and remember that it's jail time. Not the holding cell at the station, he went out of his way to say, \"Look I was in jail, not prison.\" So we have to assume he went to jail. Just as prison is different than jail, jail is different from a holding cell. Sitting at the drunk tank for a few hours because it's not worth it to process you're disorderly on St Patty's is the holding cell. Jail means you are either awaiting trial or serving a local sentence. So they booked and charged him with something. That means even though he was \"100% correct\" on his license plate issue the station and the prosecutor looked at it and distinctively didn't say, \"Dude even if this guy was an ass just leave him in the holding cell for a couple to cool off and let him go, he was 100% correct and they were giving him a bad ticket and we're going to look stupid in court.\" They did not say that, so he was either wrong, or incredibly asshattish to the cops that it was enough to want to nail him for it.\n\nBut alas in jail he meets the enlightened corrections officer, who says, \"Dude you were totes right, and shouldn't be here.\" The corrections officer, who by the nature of their job of not being a traffic cop but a corrections officer (because this jail probably run by the county with specific corrections officers and not a holding cell where it might just be whatever cop is on duty) knows traffic laws far better than the three traffic cops that originally tried to cite him and everyone at the station who decided to move ahead with booking him. But wait...he's a moron anyways, because he's a corrections officer who doesn't do a damn thing.\n\nNow there's probably a legit debate about our incarceration system since there are a lot of repeat offenders. But our hero just disses corrections officers in general because we have an imperfect system that they work for. What is his solution to reduce repeat arrests? He does not offer one, just the dis. Mine might be to have corrections officers teach classes on how not to have routine traffic violations turn into arrests - multiple times. That would cut down repeat guests apparently. But I digress.\n\nThe most important thing here is, \"Black youth see going to jail as no big deal.\" I mean getting locked up should be a horrible shameful thing that everyone avoids at all costs. I mean unless you're trying to prove a point that you were so correct about your license plate that you would rather get locked up than deal with a routine traffic ticket. Then toes go for it, bro. Cops are idiots - especially if they have vaginas.\n\nIf his story is even half true this guy is one of the most moronic people I've ever had the pleasure at laughing at.

As the Jedi order rose and then Sith tradition it came to become known as the Force and these mystics played a big role in the Star Wars of their galaxy. After the dark times of the empire some force users began to believe that the galactic civil war that destroyed planets and killed so countless many was a result of being less mystically in tune and too focused on things like Jedi orders and councils to truly be in balance with the mystic force.  Inspired by that the empire had been brought down and balance restored not by an order or Jedi council that had lost power being incorporated into the government and not even seen the Sith plot a foot in front of them, but when Yoda &amp; Obi Wan had gone into hiding to \"feel the force around them,\" that it \"surrounds us &amp; binds us\" and that they were luminous beings not the crude material things like the Jedi council had become some decide the best way to become realligned was to completely leave the galactic republic behind them and go into isolation, as Yoda had done. \n\nSo a band of pilgrims of different species of aliens left the galaxy to settle on a world in a galaxy \"far far away.\" Over the great time the settling a new small colony took and in accordance with their aims all the old ways were left behind. It was not called Jedi and force. And even in time at the colony on the new world they were not aliens from different planets, but different races - some men, some elves, some dwarfs, etc. \n\nBut their experiment was highly successful. In setting apart the bureaucracy their powers grew from levitation and shooting lighting and such, to many great things, even making what would be come known as magical objects, casting spells and a great deal of new powers. \n\nHowever in time through the generations the ways of being simple mystics on a colony of effectively monks were forgotten. Those with midichlorians or magic ability began to livve separately from those with less. Different races separated. The elves lived with the elves, the hobbits, the hobbits, etc. In time the separation out of factions, often aligned by mystic ability again led to a great war for power and the events of the war of the rings. Again a war for power based around amassing the mystical power of the universe had threatened to destroy everything so as part of it, and particularity at its conclusion and Sauron's defeat all the magic users decide that it is simply impossible for those with mystic ability to live alongside those without because the temptation to enslave those without becomes too great for those with. So they use their abilities to go \"across the sea\" or to the purely magical world to live separately. \n\nIn time, those left behind not not united in a knowledge of \"the force\" warred, and faced natural events, that largely wiped out all races but men. And in living without magic or the shared history with other races the magical elements were lost to history, except for in various stories that in time became dismissed as myth, or evolved into tales such as Hercules, or King Arthur or such.\n\nHowever, even the magic society had forgotten its own lesson learned. That the force flows through everything and they couldn't just separate the mystic from the non-mystic. Natural curiosity from some, themselves having dismissed the opinions of generations long since gone began traveling back from the magical land. And they came to see that not all magic had left. Occasionally they would run into someone in the mortal world that was what they had come to call a wizard, just as they had once been known as Jedi, those with natural mystic ability. This led to the first development of the system that would become what Harry and Hermione would eventually be a part of - identifying wizards and bringing them back to the magical world during their forays to what had become known as the muggle world. \n\nSince these trips were becoming more frequent it was no longer such an ordeal to be experienced as crossing a sea but could be done simply running through portals in walls and such as they improved the travel. But the Wizards - who still had record of a magic and non-magic world outside of legend, and still lived with different races - decided it best to keep the magical world hidden from the muggles. Spells were cast so dwarf or Goblin skeletons and such would be misidentified as pre-man species were put in place, and magic creatures such as dragons as dinosaurs, and so forth. They went out of their way when hearing of what muggles called \"miracles\" in Samaria, or the Indian-subcontent, or other hot spots to blur muggles minds with magic and have it only be remembered in faith not recorded as absolute fact. \n\nIn time this led to some wizards living in the muggle world, and mudbloods, and wizards popping up more frequently to non-wizard parents. So by the events of Harry Potter the magic system of training wizards together whether from the magical world their whole life or one of the anomalies in tune with the force from muggle land. \n\nBut by the modern era what had rose up as the ministry of magic had reached the same fate had reached the same fate as the old Jedi order. Everything had become too bureaucratic to see the rise of Tom Riddle studying the old \"Sith\" ways as he clouded the force. The events of Harry Potter tell of how someone naturally in tune with the mystic elements of the universe was able to succeed where the bureaucratic elements couldn't in Harry being an outsider hands Voldemort his final defeat. Just as Luke succeeded where the Jedi Order failed. Just as Sam and Frodo had succeeded as simpletons from Shire when the orders of wizards, elves, and men had failed.\n\nIt is a cyclic story of how those who simply believe in the natural power of the light side of the force in the universe will always be the heroes to save creation from the dark side who seeks power, and not those in who also seek power for themselves even if they claim to for the light.\n\nPalpetine summarized it in RotS when Anakin said, \"The Sith only seek power,\" and he responded, \"And the Jedi don't?\" \n\nThe same could be said for the follow on wars that face this combined universe: \"Sauron seeks power for himself - and the Kings of Men don't?\" \"The death eaters seek power for themselves - and the ministry of magic doesn't?\"\n\nLuke, Frodo, and Sam were able to draw on the mystic in the universe to defeat the evil power seekers because they really had no greed in their hearts themselves - none of them were seeking any power for themselves.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the ultimate nerd unification I&amp;#39;ll tackle Star Wars series ---&amp;gt; LOTR series (movies only, I know Tolkein has his whole back story, so throw his not addressed in the movies stuff out)----&amp;gt; Harry Potter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A long time ago in a galaxy far far away some people first began to understand the mystic elements of the universe.

Just as Sam and Frodo had succeeded as simpletons from Shire when the orders of wizards, elves, and men had failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is a cyclic story of how those who simply believe in the natural power of the light side of the force in the universe will always be the heroes to save creation from the dark side who seeks power, and not those in who also seek power for themselves even if they claim to for the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Palpetine summarized it in RotS when Anakin said, &amp;quot;The Sith only seek power,&amp;quot; and he responded, &amp;quot;And the Jedi don&amp;#39;t?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same could be said for the follow on wars that face this combined universe: &amp;quot;Sauron seeks power for himself - and the Kings of Men don&amp;#39;t?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The death eaters seek power for themselves - and the ministry of magic doesn&amp;#39;t?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luke, Frodo, and Sam were able to draw on the mystic in the universe to defeat the evil power seekers because they really had no greed in their hearts themselves - none of them were seeking any power for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2d1g56", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2d1g56/what_3_completely_unrelated_films_can_you_put/cjlheor/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2d1g56/what_3_completely_unrelated_films_can_you_put/", "name": "t1_cjlheor", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1407601187.0, "created_utc": 1407601187.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2d1g56/what_3_completely_unrelated_films_can_you_put/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What 3 completely unrelated films, can you put together to make a great trilogy?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "movies", "link_author": "OneManSidekick1", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cjlfh8s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "I_like_sluts", "num_comments": 2565, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_2d1g56", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_gp249", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Rambo 3, Charlie Wilson's War, Zero Dark Thirty.\n\nWe set up that some bad asses in place ready to fight some Soviets in the 'Stan.
