Initially, I talked with our DM about the logistics of spellcasting and he said he wanted to simplify it by removing Material Spell Components.

He was trying to speed up gameplay for the whole table and I felt like it was eliminating half of the fun for me as a spellcaster. I totally agree with your criticism of dnd 5e for having all this magic granted without enough explanation, but I feel like it was purposefully left vague for players and GMs to invent on their own. like, the Verbal and Somatic components are not specified, so it requires you as a player to invent your own way of casting the spells.\n\nFor Fireball, the Material component is \"a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur\" but there are still Verbal and Somatic components that are not laid out in the rules...

I am sure it varies table to table.\n\nBack to my homegame, I expressed to my DM that I wanted to do more spell explanation stuff and if he didn't want to bog down gameplay, I can just role play it super quick and make stuff up, and he said \"awesome, yeah, make it up\"... fast-forward to last week's game. The first time I had the opportunity to cast Water Breathing on the party, and the material component says \"a short reed or a straw\". We were in a hurry, so I could not cast it as a Ritual (ten minutes) so I explained the hurried spell as my character placing Oxygenated Salt Crystals in my mouth, and then spitting a cloud of crystals through the reed at the party. If it were cast as a ritual, it would have been less wasteful with the crystals and therefore not cost a spell slot. We never explained where I found the crystals though..... I guess I had them in a pouch since level 1 and finally reached the level where I could use them?  \n\n\nMost of my other spells have just Verbal and Somatic components, so I mutter something in Deep Speech or another fictional language while doing variations of American Sign Language handsigns.  I am particularly proud of making the Verbal component of Misty Step \"Ah-chu!\" as I sneeze myself up to 30ft away.\n\nIn other news, I have also been working on a science fiction rpg and it is so much fun to find technological explanations for the magic spells we all know from every game ever and invent some new player abilities based on their gadgets. \n\nTLDR:  \nI agree that DND5e does not explain enough about where magic comes from, but I think that void in the rulebook creates opportunity for players and DMs to invent their own explanation.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am new to the world of RPGs and dnd5e is the only game I have played consistently, beyond one shots&lt;br/&gt;\nIn my current homegame, I am the druid player, and we also have two rogues and a fighter.

Perhaps, shouting &amp;quot;FIREBALL&amp;quot; and then make a gesture like rolling some dice???? Or say &amp;quot;Adios, mother ffff-&amp;quot; and pantomime a grenade lob, then the kaboom happens.... who knows. I am sure it varies table to table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to my homegame, I expressed to my DM that I wanted to do more spell explanation stuff and if he didn&amp;#39;t want to bog down gameplay, I can just role play it super quick and make stuff up, and he said &amp;quot;awesome, yeah, make it up&amp;quot;... fast-forward to last week&amp;#39;s game. The first time I had the opportunity to cast Water Breathing on the party, and the material component says &amp;quot;a short reed or a straw&amp;quot;. We were in a hurry, so I could not cast it as a Ritual (ten minutes) so I explained the hurried spell as my character placing Oxygenated Salt Crystals in my mouth, and then spitting a cloud of crystals through the reed at the party. If it were cast as a ritual, it would have been less wasteful with the crystals and therefore not cost a spell slot. We never explained where I found the crystals though..... I guess I had them in a pouch since level 1 and finally reached the level where I could use them?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of my other spells have just Verbal and Somatic components, so I mutter something in Deep Speech or another fictional language while doing variations of American Sign Language handsigns.  I am particularly proud of making the Verbal component of Misty Step &amp;quot;Ah-chu!&amp;quot; as I sneeze myself up to 30ft away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other news, I have also been working on a science fiction rpg and it is so much fun to find technological explanations for the magic spells we all know from every game ever and invent some new player abilities based on their gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR:&lt;br/&gt;\nI agree that DND5e does not explain enough about where magic comes from, but I think that void in the rulebook creates opportunity for players and DMs to invent their own explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_jrwpvh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/rpg/comments/jrwpvh/a_train_of_thought_about_magic_and_scifi_games/gbzpqa1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/jrwpvh/a_train_of_thought_about_magic_and_scifi_games/", "name": "t1_gbzpqa1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/rpg", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1605142804.0, "created_utc": 1605142804.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/jrwpvh/a_train_of_thought_about_magic_and_scifi_games/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2whek", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What sorts of inappropriate usage of holodecks might actually ensue?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "DaystromInstitute", "link_author": "NorCalNavyMike", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "gbzfsag", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "SirGoo", "num_comments": 32, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_jsdk84", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_64xxg", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "this seems like a good premise for the first R-rated Star Trek film", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;this seems like a good premise for the first R-rated Star Trek film&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_jsdk84", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/jsdk84/what_sorts_of_inappropriate_usage_of_holodecks/gbzfsag/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/jsdk84/what_sorts_of_inappropriate_usage_of_holodecks/", "name": "t1_gbzfsag", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DaystromInstitute", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1605137497.0, "created_utc": 1605137497.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/jsdk84/what_sorts_of_inappropriate_usage_of_holodecks/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Scotch Robin - See Space.
