I swear that this is a true story and while I don't expect people to change their views, I saw what I saw.\n\nWhen I was in sixth grade, my friend Roger (not a real name...well, it is a real name, but it's not Roger's real name) had a sleep-over birthday party at an abandoned hotel that was rumored to be haunted. The owner of the hotel was Roger's dad's college roommate, so this was not a normal thing that people got to do. Roger was really into ghosts, UFO's, sasquatch (he still goes on squatch hunts), and other paranormal stuff.\n\nAnyway, the hotel was a masterpiece in its day and was still a really cool piece of architecture. The rumors are that the hauntings involve the people that died in several mysterious \"accidents\" over the years. A woman jumped to her death from her 8th story window; a busboy was decapitated in a freak elevator accident, a little boy was poisoned by his father, and a dance floor collapsed in the 1950s, killing about 80 people. \n\nWe set up camp on the dance floor and after about an hour of waiting for something to happen and nothing happening, we decided to play hide and seek. \n\nWe had been playing for about an hour when Roger's little brother David (his real name...screw David) was it. Being several years younger than the rest of us, he was terrible to play with. He was slow and the \"hiding\" went on for ever. I finally decided that I was going to let David catch me so we could move on, but I decided to scare the crap out of him first by sneaking up on him and yelling as loud as I could. I waited inside one of the guests rooms near the stairwell and waiting for David to come that way. I heard him coming up the stairs and as he skipped my floor, I started following him up. I thought I was moving quickly, but I lost David somewhere on the stairwell. At the 8th floor, I peek out and see David standing at the end of the hallway. I move stealthily from doorway to doorway, trying to get to him before he hears me. As I get to him, I put my hand on his shoulder and scream \"BOOOOOOO!\" as loud as I can. David doesn't flinch. Also, I'm not touching David. I should be...my hand is where David's shoulder should be, but there is no solid contact. Just air. It's not like a scary movie or anything, the boy didn't turn around and look at me. He just vanished. I had never seen anything like it and I probably would have stood there, stunned, for hours if hadn't heard Roger screaming \"HELP!\" \n\nI heard Roger's screams and ran down five flights of stairs until I found him in the middle of the hallway with his foot stuck in the floorboards. He said he wasn't hurt, but he couldn't get his foot out. I asked him how I could help him and he said, \"Can I get tree fiddy?\" It was at this time that I realized Roger was actually 8-stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era.\n\nTL;DR: \"GAWD DAMN YOU, LOCH NESS MONSTAH, I AINT' GIVIN' YOU NO TREE FIDDY!\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was that child.
