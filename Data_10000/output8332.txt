'Corporatise' as it is called. This sends a message to almost 9,000 employees that Delhaize no longer sees operating shops, and keeping them on the payroll to do so, as their core business.  \n\nThe first interpretation in the media of this drastic management choice is deadpan. About why this is something typically Belgian, inevitable, or even a good thing for the retail sector. Dead-doers such as increased production prices, wage costs, or the Belgian trade unions that are even said to be responsible for the length of the queues at the Delhaize checkouts.  \n\n**1 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK**\n\nIt is surprising that apparently for a proper understanding one does not just start with the Ahold Delhaize website. For there, one of the main statements is neatly posted: also for 2023, AD is making shareholders and investors comfortable with a share buyback programme of no less than one billion euros. In other words, the retail group is going to use one billion euros of company assets to buy back shareholders' shares, giving them a very hefty swag on top of the already double dividend.  \n\nEven in the US, such giant gifts to shareholders are under fire, especially with the increased cost of living. President Biden recently called for quadrupling the tax on such share buyback programmes, so that companies can at least invest corporate profits productively in society. Here in Belgium, this fact hardly seems to resonate in socio-economic interpretation, even though it aptly illustrates a very structural problem with the retail sector.  \n\n**RETAILPARADOX**\n\nIndeed, a paradox surfaced among retail giants in the 1990s. Their business performance in terms of sales was flagging, while on the contrary, return on investment for shareholders was rising and remained high. Research shows that behind this contradiction lies an increased power of hungry shareholders. They demand their returns, even at the expense of longer-term performance, by skimming funds needed for the e-commerce race, for example.  \n\nAfter the international expansion of the 1990s hit its limits - including for Belgian groups - they sought and found ways to squeeze margins in business operations for the greedy shareholders. Among other things, by putting pressure on - the social and ecological conditions at - suppliers, by divesting as many tasks \"outside the core business\" as possible through franchising, subcontracting or temporary work, and by eroding staff working conditions.  \n\nThis strategy succeeds for retail multinationals because, through market concentration and the growth of international supply chains, they have acquired an enormously strong and market-distorting position of power vis-\u00e0-vis customer, employee, supplier and national politics. In Belgium, according to KU Leuven research, this market power in the retail sector is even measurable in the decreasing share of produced surplus value in the retail sector that goes to wages: a structural, upward redistribution from cashier to shareholder.  \n\n**RECORD WORKING POOR**\n  \nSo let there be no doubt about what this sweeping management choice means for workers. The joint committee under which such independent shops fall is the sad record holder for the risk of working in poverty. Almost half of the workers, mostly female, on that joint committee are doing low-wage work. A precarious situation the greatly fuelled by frequent involuntary part-time work.  \n\nIt is no coincidence that conditions in those independent shops are worse than in the joint committees covering large retail outlets. It is extremely difficult for employees to obtain decent working conditions individually or collectively when working with a handful of employees in an independent shop, whose operator also often has little margin or autonomy of its own vis-\u00e0-vis the retail group.  \n\nCustomers and society also pay for this strategy of retail giants. Via pricing passed on in our shopping cart, but also indirectly via the costs implicitly passed on.

This sends a message to almost 9,000 employees that Delhaize no longer sees operating shops, and keeping them on the payroll to do so, as their core business.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first interpretation in the media of this drastic management choice is deadpan. About why this is something typically Belgian, inevitable, or even a good thing for the retail sector. Dead-doers such as increased production prices, wage costs, or the Belgian trade unions that are even said to be responsible for the length of the queues at the Delhaize checkouts.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is surprising that apparently for a proper understanding one does not just start with the Ahold Delhaize website. For there, one of the main statements is neatly posted: also for 2023, AD is making shareholders and investors comfortable with a share buyback programme of no less than one billion euros. In other words, the retail group is going to use one billion euros of company assets to buy back shareholders&amp;#39; shares, giving them a very hefty swag on top of the already double dividend.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even in the US, such giant gifts to shareholders are under fire, especially with the increased cost of living. President Biden recently called for quadrupling the tax on such share buyback programmes, so that companies can at least invest corporate profits productively in society. Here in Belgium, this fact hardly seems to resonate in socio-economic interpretation, even though it aptly illustrates a very structural problem with the retail sector.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RETAILPARADOX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a paradox surfaced among retail giants in the 1990s. Their business performance in terms of sales was flagging, while on the contrary, return on investment for shareholders was rising and remained high. Research shows that behind this contradiction lies an increased power of hungry shareholders. They demand their returns, even at the expense of longer-term performance, by skimming funds needed for the e-commerce race, for example.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the international expansion of the 1990s hit its limits - including for Belgian groups - they sought and found ways to squeeze margins in business operations for the greedy shareholders. Among other things, by putting pressure on - the social and ecological conditions at - suppliers, by divesting as many tasks &amp;quot;outside the core business&amp;quot; as possible through franchising, subcontracting or temporary work, and by eroding staff working conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This strategy succeeds for retail multinationals because, through market concentration and the growth of international supply chains, they have acquired an enormously strong and market-distorting position of power vis-\u00e0-vis customer, employee, supplier and national politics. In Belgium, according to KU Leuven research, this market power in the retail sector is even measurable in the decreasing share of produced surplus value in the retail sector that goes to wages: a structural, upward redistribution from cashier to shareholder.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECORD WORKING POOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So let there be no doubt about what this sweeping management choice means for workers. The joint committee under which such independent shops fall is the sad record holder for the risk of working in poverty. Almost half of the workers, mostly female, on that joint committee are doing low-wage work. A precarious situation the greatly fuelled by frequent involuntary part-time work.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that conditions in those independent shops are worse than in the joint committees covering large retail outlets. It is extremely difficult for employees to obtain decent working conditions individually or collectively when working with a handful of employees in an independent shop, whose operator also often has little margin or autonomy of its own vis-\u00e0-vis the retail group.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customers and society also pay for this strategy of retail giants. Via pricing passed on in our shopping cart, but also indirectly via the costs implicitly passed on. To serve shareholders better, staff have to work increasingly &amp;#39;flexibly&amp;#39; without adequate compensation, via involuntary part-time contracts, under increasing time pressure, with uncertain timetables, and at atypical hours and days.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Organising such demonstrably pathological work contributes to the growth of the group of inactive people, with 200,000 long-term sick and an equally large group of involuntary part-time workers already in Flanders.
