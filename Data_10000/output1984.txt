At the time it happened I was 29. Very little cancer suspicion at that age.\n\nHad my seizures start in August 2021.

Myself, my coworkers, my friends, the emergency room. nobody guessed they were seizures. \n\nStarted out as about one every other day. Then I went on a hiking trip in the mountains and it grew to 7 times per day. Other symptoms developed the next week: sudden onset nausea, light sensitivity, endless fatigue, no appetite. The seizures also grew longer and began to feel heaviest and longest in my right arm and leg. Went to the ER and threw up on their front entrance. Got diagnosed and test positive for lyme disease (got bit by deer ticks in that spring) so that hid the problem. The antibiotics actually fixed the light sensitivity but everything else was still bad. \n\nI was on sick leave from work after the new symptoms started. Trying to recover by relaxing. Would sleep 20 hours per day and still be tired, would throw up 20 times with literally zero warning. Had a bucket a foot away and would still not be able to get it fast enough). No appetite, and trying to eat would make me throw up within 20 minutes. \n\nFinished the anti biotics, apparently cracked a joke to some friends about having cancer. Thought the symptoms might just need a little time to fade, but if they were still around come saturday I would go back to the ER. That Friday I fell to the ground unable to walk, and my roommates called the ambulance. \n\nI could no longer read. My heart had dropped to 30 bpm. Ambulance brought me to the nearest hospital which was geared towards children. That night I was helicoptered to a much bigger hospital a hundred miles away and got emergency brain surgery. I was blacked out for the whole time except for the ambulance ride, helicopter ride, and a few minutes here and there in the hospital I was brought to. Woke up nearly 48 hours later to find my parents over me in the ICU. \n\nMy appetite was back. I could walk again. No more nausea. The symptoms were gone.\n\nI had a weird shadow flicker in the corner of my vision. I still could not read. I would forget words mid-sentence while speaking and have to ask what word I was thinking of my using its definition. These were likely damages from the ER surgery. \n\nFound out I had lost 40 lbs in the last 3 weeks due to starvation. It was tough to walk more than a few hundred feet due to that. \n\nThe surgeon came to the ICU and told me I have Glioblastoma IDH Mutant and he had gotten about 90%. I had no idea what that meant until I looked it up at home a week later. I cried more in the next two months than I had in the last 20 years. Often cried myself to sleep. I was also informed that the tumor was about the size of an orange. \n\nGot a second surgery a month later to allow for more preparation. This surgery had an MRI machine on hand and was done while I was still awake so they could remove as much of what remains as possible. Basically they get the patient numbed with several shots and blacked out with a constant drug supply. So it is nto remembered. The only time they ease up is when they are testing for access locations by giving some light tests while tazing the brain. When I was told to count from 1 to 50 on repeate but ended up skipping from 36 to 77 it was a clear sign to not cut where they just stunned. \n\nIn the end I chose not to return to the job for a simple reason that I may only have 30 months left to live as that is the average survival for IDH mutant.

Working on a bunch of hobbies. Been getting MRIs every two months and each shows the tumors remains getting smaller and smaller. \n\nBut...\n\nI kind of have to accept that the wife and kids I had wanted before are no longer a realistic future for me. I have had to accept that this thing will likely return at some point and kill me or put me through another round of surgeries and meds that might buy another couple years. But that each time it returns it will be a little bit tougher due to more mutations than before.
