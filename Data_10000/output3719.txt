Group B is exposed to an idea from Group A, but rather than taking everything from Group A, Group B takes the one aspect that appeals to them and adjusts it to fit their existing culture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another example is America in the 1960s getting exposed to &amp;#39;Eastern Mysticism&amp;#39; and latching on to the idea of &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot; ... karma requires reincarnation: the acquired karma in one life isn&amp;#39;t applied until the next life... most westerners didn&amp;#39;t adopt the reincarnation idea, they just took karma and it became &amp;quot;what goes around comes around&amp;quot; or &amp;#39;put good vibes into the universe and it will come back and do good for you&amp;#39;.. why didn&amp;#39;t 60&amp;#39;s counter culture just all become Hindus?
