Sources are from countless articles, conversations with professional nutritionists, RRCA running coaches, etc.  If anyone notices something untrue about this, *please* let me know because I want to know!\n\nThe early morning run has the advantage of increasing your metabolic rate earlier in the day which can help you burn more calories overall, but it's not as dramatic as you may have been led to believe.\n\nThink through the early morning run.  You wake up from fasting for 8 hours.  You are hungry.  During sleep, free blood glucose is consumed by your body systems and it hasn't been replenished (via food intake and then digestion) in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe number of calories each body is capable of storing is based on a lot of factors - muscle mass, blood circulation, etc.  However, the number of calories each body *burns* is also variable.  So for example a 50kg female may have less total fuel storage due to less blood volume and smaller muscle mass than a 100kg male, but the 50kg female must expend less energy per step to move than a 100kg male.  Thus, we can estimate the *effective* calorie maximum for a person to be around 2000.\n\nNot surprisingly, this corresponds to the typical 20 mile \"wall\" that marathoners often experience: ~100 calories per mile x 20 miles = ~2000 calories.  A big part of marathon conditioning is figuring out how to extend that 2000 calorie range into the 2600 range through race nutrition and adaptations (e.g., dropping the calories per-mile consumed).\n\nAssuming you were perfectly supplied at your maximum of 2000 free calories worth of stored carbohydrates the day before, you will be down approximately 1/3rd of your BMR, whatever that is.  Let's say, for example, that mine is 1800.  Assuming I've been resting for the week in preparation for a race event (I am - it's tomorrow!) I am probably fully stocked when I go to bed, or pretty close.  So, when I wake up, I can expect to have around 1200 calories of energy to spend.  That lets me run around 12 miles.  That means if I don't eat breakfast or anything on the run I can expect to feel physically exhausted around 12-14 miles.\n\nNow, your body will not let you deplete your blood glucose to zero, because you would die.   When we talk about aerobic exercise, we often talk about heart rate zones, where \"zone 2\" is the \"fat burning zone.\"  What does this mean?\n\nIt means that when your heart rate reaches around 50-55% of its maximum, your body is smart and starts to realize that you're starting to burn glycogen pretty fast, so it begins the process of asking your fat cells to release lipids to the liver to synthesize.\n\nSo, in the marathon example I gave above, I insinuated that at mile 20, your calories-via-glucose hits 0 and you hit the wall - but again, the reality is that if that were to happen your heart would stop and you would die.  Your body will send you very strong signals of fatigue when your blood glucose reaches dangerously low levels (e.g. - the diabetic coma, in extreme cases).  If you've ever run a long distance event and hit this wall, you know what it feels like.\n\nSome people are capable of pushing beyond this limit, but doing so is playing with fire as you are essentially overriding your body's warning system.  It's very hard to do, so therefore it's rare for athletes to die from exhaustion (usually heart attacks - where the heart itself runs out of glucose to beat) because the desire to stop moving becomes overwhelming at certain points.\n\nBut I digress.  So, the point is, as you begin aerobic activity like running, your body begins to metabolize fat (which requires water, which is why drinking on the run is so important - it aids in this process).  I speculate - and mind you I haven't seen direct evidence of this (though it may exist), but I speculate - that the rate at which your body can metabolize fat is an athletic adaptation.  I know many ultra runners (post marathon distances) believe this fact as they will do seemingly crazy things like eat incredibly high-fat diets to teach their bodies to better metabolize fat.  Some of these guys are incredibly fast over incredible distances so there may be some truth to this claim.\n\nNow, all of this happens *regardless* of the time of day you are running.  If your body is hungry (as when you wake up, or if you skip lunch) it is just its way of telling you that it's eating into your glucose stores and you should probably replenish them.\n\nWhen you run, you enter the aerobic zone that begins burning fat - again, regardless of the time of day.  Some people claim that running in the morning is better because it keeps your heart rate higher all day - but I personally do not believe this claim, nor does anyone that I know in the running community.  Most runners who would have the gumption to actually wake up and run first thing in the morning consistently for any length of time will find that they will return from an elevated 50%-of-max HR to a normal resting heart rate very quickly after ceasing aerobic activity.  It is only in beginners where you see elevated heart rate (more than a few beats per minute) for any lasting length of time after exercise.  For example, I will return to a near-resting heart rate (perhaps 25% of max) in less than 5 minutes after finishing exercise.  Note that it is true that you will see elevated heart rate for potentially *days* after particularly hard efforts - e.g. marathons - but it should not be elevated high enough to trigger the metabolism of fat into glucose.  If you have a zone 2 heart rate for hours, let alone *days* after running any distance event, you should immediately seek medical attention because that is not normal to my understanding.\n\nYour body *wants* its fat, so it will not burn it because it thinks it can convince you to eat by creating hunger signals in the body.  By performing aerobic exercise you will trigger your body to begin replenishing glucose **regardless of your level of hunger**.  Think of it like a simple decision tree:\n\n    Is my rate of glucose depletion &lt; x? \n        Yes\n            Is my blood glucose lower than y?\n                Yes\n                    Create hunger pangs\n                    Is it less than z?\n                         Yes\n                             Begin metabolizing fat\n                No\n                    Do nothing\n        No\n            Begin metabolizing fat\n\n\nWhere x, y, and z are individual variables that can at most be described as bell curves.  Everybody is different.\n\nThis is why both aerobic exercise *and* fasting can produce fat loss in bodies.  Doing both at the same time can prove very hard because fat metabolism is not as fast as calories reconstituted through digestion, and therefore you will feel chronically exhausted when you try to run, which is why during running training your coaches will always tell you to make sure to eat enough.  Don't run hungry, because you'll just hit the wall even over short distances and not hit your training goals.  When your body is metabolizing fat because your blood glucose falls below a threshold (rather than because of the rate of consumption as with exercise), it will only consume enough fat to keep your blood sugar at a stable level for body functions, and no more.  Remember, your body likes its fat.  Think of it like using a generator when your power is out.  You are going to plug in your refrigerator, a few lights, and a few other things.  You're not going to try to power everything, because you only have so much gasoline in the tank.  The gas is your fat.\n\nSo, TL;DR - no, not really.\n  ", "edited": 1468597503.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is my understanding from years of distance running.

Some people claim that running in the morning is better because it keeps your heart rate higher all day - but I personally do not believe this claim, nor does anyone that I know in the running community.  Most runners who would have the gumption to actually wake up and run first thing in the morning consistently for any length of time will find that they will return from an elevated 50%-of-max HR to a normal resting heart rate very quickly after ceasing aerobic activity.  It is only in beginners where you see elevated heart rate (more than a few beats per minute) for any lasting length of time after exercise.  For example, I will return to a near-resting heart rate (perhaps 25% of max) in less than 5 minutes after finishing exercise.  Note that it is true that you will see elevated heart rate for potentially &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt; after particularly hard efforts - e.g. marathons - but it should not be elevated high enough to trigger the metabolism of fat into glucose.  If you have a zone 2 heart rate for hours, let alone &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt; after running any distance event, you should immediately seek medical attention because that is not normal to my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your body &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; its fat, so it will not burn it because it thinks it can convince you to eat by creating hunger signals in the body.  By performing aerobic exercise you will trigger your body to begin replenishing glucose &lt;strong&gt;regardless of your level of hunger&lt;/strong&gt;.  Think of it like a simple decision tree:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Is my rate of glucose depletion &amp;lt; x? \n    Yes\n        Is my blood glucose lower than y?\n            Yes\n                Create hunger pangs\n                Is it less than z?\n                     Yes\n                         Begin metabolizing fat\n            No\n                Do nothing\n    No\n        Begin metabolizing fat\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where x, y, and z are individual variables that can at most be described as bell curves.  Everybody is different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why both aerobic exercise &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fasting can produce fat loss in bodies.  Doing both at the same time can prove very hard because fat metabolism is not as fast as calories reconstituted through digestion, and therefore you will feel chronically exhausted when you try to run, which is why during running training your coaches will always tell you to make sure to eat enough.  Don&amp;#39;t run hungry, because you&amp;#39;ll just hit the wall even over short distances and not hit your training goals.  When your body is metabolizing fat because your blood glucose falls below a threshold (rather than because of the rate of consumption as with exercise), it will only consume enough fat to keep your blood sugar at a stable level for body functions, and no more.  Remember, your body likes its fat.  Think of it like using a generator when your power is out.  You are going to plug in your refrigerator, a few lights, and a few other things.  You&amp;#39;re not going to try to power everything, because you only have so much gasoline in the tank.  The gas is your fat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, TL;DR - no, not really.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4svwx4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/askscience/comments/4svwx4/what_do_you_catabolize_first_during_starvation/d5ddvm5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4svwx4/what_do_you_catabolize_first_during_starvation/", "name": "t1_d5ddvm5", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/askscience", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1468596069.0, "created_utc": 1468596069.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4svwx4/what_do_you_catabolize_first_during_starvation/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi0a", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Nintendo opens up to all developers", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 9, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "gamedev", "link_author": "richmondavid", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d5aoh40", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "teckreddit", "num_comments": 202, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d5ak84r", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_bcoy6", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "C# is a *language*.

In my *deep* experience in this particular area, the people who cross after 60 are usually waddling, or limping, or pushing a double stroller.\n\nDon't get butthurt and put words in my mouth.\n\n&gt; But you really need to fucking tell Cancer Research UK\n\nThey found a gimmick that works.  Other 5k gimmicks include glorified dog walks (usually called \"paws and claws\" events).  The \"donut run\" where you stuff your face with 2400 calories worth of 6 donuts while expending around 300 to cover a 5k distance.  Yes, obviously they market these events as \"runs\" so that people who would get butthurt over being asked to race in a race event will show up and give them their money.  I don't volunteer at Cancer Research UK events.\n\n&gt; I'm raising potentially hundreds of pounds for Cancer Research UK by entering their run and \"waddling\" at my speed of 40 minutes. \n\nYou could just write them a check for hundreds of pounds and stay home, or waddle around the park for 40 minutes.  It's not about the charity donation, so don't pretend that it is.\n\nAlso, I think I'm on record as saying a 40 minute 5k is a low-end novice time, not a waddle.  60 minutes is waddling territory.  Don't get it twisted, now.\n\n&gt; During a race, you run to beat other people. During a run, you run to challenge yourself.\n\nYou don't need me to setup a finish line for you to challenge yourself.  You don't need to spend however many hundreds of pounds you're spending on cancer research to challenge yourself by running.  If it were about challenging yourself you could do it without others waiting around for you.\n\nHowever, I do need timers, a marked course, a finish line, and hundreds of other competitors to race against.  I can't race and compete by myself.  See the difference?\n\n&gt; If that's not worth an hour of your time or a clap of hands then so be it;\n\nA typical volunteer engagement is around 3 hours for a 5k and that's for the event itself.  We've managed to cut that down to around 2 hours because we're good at it, but we still need an hour to run the event +/- 30 minutes to setup and tear down the course and post the results.  But that's not really the point.  The point is that for the typical adult, past a certain time threshold, the 5k is no longer an accomplishment.  It's like applauding someone for strolling down the street.  It's ludicrous.\n\n&gt; I'm not insisting I be applauded\n\nYeah, you kind of are.  You're heavily implying that if I were volunteering at the finish line for you and you decided to take 45 minutes to run a 5k when most healthy adults your age can walk faster and I don't applaud you, I have a \"fucking shitty attitude\" and you'd be devastated because I'm clearly demonstrating that I think you're \"wasting my time\" (you are).  I don't appreciate the judgment on my attitude.\n\n&gt; I'm insisting that you don't accuse people who have paid \u00a330 (and possibly raised a lot more) to run a course with no given speed requirements of \"wasting your time\".\n\nYou are wasting my time.  I volunteer at a 5k road race, not a 5k leisurely stroll.  I don't give a shit how many pounds fucking sterling you paid to be there.  I'm there *volunteering*.  I do it for *free*.  I don't see a penny of that money.\n\nIf you want to *pay* me to stand around a finish line for you so you can take 40, or 45, or 2 hours, or however long it takes, I'll charge you time and a half at your finish time plus an hour for setup and tear down.  It's all about mutual respect.  You respect *my* time as a volunteer by actually trying and not signing up if you aren't fit for a 5k, and in return I respect *your* time and give you a free race.  As far as I'm concerned, it is free.  I help run free races all the time that aren't laden with charity overtures.  They're sadly harder and harder to find these days.\n\nThese charity runs you're talking about specifically don't put speed requirements down because they want your money.  They don't give a shit about the sport, they want your money, period.  What I said is that 60 minutes is the generally understood DNF time for a 5k in the *running community*, not the charity world that has coopted the 5k road race as a money making venture.\n\nYes, these charities market 5ks as runs.  Yes, they encourage walking.  Yes, they have despoiled the concept of a road race in the interests of lining their pockets, and yes, you're lapping it up.\n\n&gt; you seem to expect a lot of concessions and applause for merely giving up a couple of hours of your time.\n\nDon't make assumptions and don't put words in my mouth.  I never said shit about my motivations.\n\nI don't volunteer at these events because I'm altruistic, and I don't do it because I want people like you to thank me or think better of me.  I do it for exactly 2 reasons:\n\n* I want events that *aren't* bullshit walk/run $30-for-charity-and-a-shirt Facebook fodder to continue to exist.  Charities like Cancer Research UK are fucking over road running with this bullshit, and I want to preserve it because I enjoy the *sport* of running and the competition of *racing*.  These days, if you want to find an event that *isn't* one of these walk/run costumed circuses or force you to donate money to a cause you may or may not care about, you have to be \"in the know\" (i.e., you have to know the RD and know what kind of event they're running).\n* I am friends with many of the RD's because I'm active in the running community and when they ask for help orchestrating these events I do it for *him*, not for the Ragen Chastains of the world who waddle 5ks in an hour and want kudos.\n\n&gt; maybe don't sign up as a charity run volunteer if you are going to act like a martyr.\n\nWhen you sign up for my event and then waste my time, I have a right to be annoyed.  I am the one providing for you, not the other way around.  You aren't doing shit for me.  You may be doing something for the charity; that's independent of me and you could give them the money *without* coming to a 5k, and you know it.\n\nBut, you know what?
