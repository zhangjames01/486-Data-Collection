Even if you return, your life would have changed permanently, you&amp;#39;ll have better prospects for career, you&amp;#39;ll know the true worth of your skills and have better negotiation skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_tqyxdb", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/india/comments/tqyxdb/people_who_want_to_settle_in_us_why/i2syh0g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/tqyxdb/people_who_want_to_settle_in_us_why/", "name": "t1_i2syh0g", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/india", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1648697173.0, "created_utc": 1648697173.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/tqyxdb/people_who_want_to_settle_in_us_why/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1q", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "80 p currency | Penpencildraw on Twitter", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "india", "link_author": "bhodrolok", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i2qdffd", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "iamprasad88", "num_comments": 8, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i2pbzy7", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_dr2c", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "80p price hike for petrol", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;80p price hike for petrol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_ts1vz2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/india/comments/ts1vz2/80_p_currency_penpencildraw_on_twitter/i2qdffd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ts1vz2/80_p_currency_penpencildraw_on_twitter/", "name": "t1_i2qdffd", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/india", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1648657567.0, "created_utc": 1648657567.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/vevf4vthghq81.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1q", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "people who want to settle in US, why ?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "india", "link_author": "altsnoorecipes", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i2q3yh7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "iamprasad88", "num_comments": 525, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_tqyxdb", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_dr2c", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You assumed people who go there are privileged, that's why you are confused.\n\nMy parents had to choose between paying bills and paying my school tutuion.
