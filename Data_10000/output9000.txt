To quell the controversy or to suppress TST\u2019s viewpoint, governments regularly opt to silence TST. As below, a recurring justification is a trumped-up charge of \u201cpublic safety concerns.\u201d Thus, if the Court reverses the below decision, all governments in the Fourth Circuit will have a handy template for prohibiting TST\u2019s religious activism. Next time it could be us. Or any of our friends across the religious spectrum, whose practices are infringed upon by the political class.\n\nIn other words, \u201cif you do this to these people, you can just as easily do it to us. Refusing to allow this [bad] thing to happen sets a dangerous precedent that can be used to silence legitimate activism.\u201d\n\nThey go on to explicitly state:\n\n&gt;\tMake no mistake: TST strenuously disagrees with St. Michael\u2019s religious view- points. The Catholic Church\u2019s failure to appropriately address the child sex abuse scandals suggests it should be abandoned, not fixed within; and one will not soon find TST\u2019s membership praying the Rosary. TST also disagrees with the statements the City has attributed to Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos. It is completely antithetical to TST\u2019s ideology for these speakers to advocate for\nviolence, racism, misogyny, or the overthrow of the American government.\n\nImplying that the TST is therefore a bad organization that supports far right extremists because they filed that amicus brief is disgusting and in appallingly bad faith.

To quell the controversy or to suppress TST\u2019s viewpoint, governments regularly opt to silence TST. As below, a recurring justification is a trumped-up charge of \u201cpublic safety concerns.\u201d Thus, if the Court reverses the below decision, all governments in the Fourth Circuit will have a handy template for prohibiting TST\u2019s religious activism. Next time it could be us. Or any of our friends across the religious spectrum, whose practices are infringed upon by the political class.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, \u201cif you do this to these people, you can just as easily do it to us. Refusing to allow this [bad] thing to happen sets a dangerous precedent that can be used to silence legitimate activism.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They go on to explicitly state:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: TST strenuously disagrees with St. Michael\u2019s religious view- points. The Catholic Church\u2019s failure to appropriately address the child sex abuse scandals suggests it should be abandoned, not fixed within; and one will not soon find TST\u2019s membership praying the Rosary.
