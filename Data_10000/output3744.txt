As for what spells to prepare, here's a few staples I reccomend (Your playstyle may vary)\n\n* Firebolt - this is arguably the best damaging cantrip and you can cast it as many times a day as you want. Decent range, it can ignite flammable objects so making a campfire or burning down a wood shack are on the table. It gets a little stronger as you level, so this can be a staple for your entire wizard career.\n\n* Mage Hand - Another cantrip. Basically, you can interact with any item within 30ft for free, with some limitations. Set off traps from a distance, pull levers across the room, drop a pebble somewhere to distract a guard, the possibilities are staggering. Additionally, if you take the Telekinesis feat, the range goes up to 60ft and the hand can make a 5ft shove action. Ever use an illusion to lure an enemy to the edge of a cliff, then shove him off of it with an invisible telekinetic hand? \n\n* Identify - this is a ritual spell, which means you can spend 10 minutes casting it, and it won't take up a spell slot. One of the most classic spells in D&amp;D, it basically instantly lets you know the magical properties of an object. Magically sealed doors, magic rings or weapons, you name it. \n\n* Fireball - Another classic spell. Great damage, good AOE. Just be careful about not igniting your party members on fire. \n\n* Shield - I love this spell. It's super underrated. Just don't forget to activate it when appropriate. That is to say, it's a reaction spell you can cast whenever someone attacks you, whether it be a spell attack (different from an AOE or DC based spell), melee, or ranged attack. It adds +5 AC until your next turn, including agains the triggering attack. Since wizards have poor AC and low health, this is one of the best defenses you can have at low levels. \n\nThere are tons of other amazing spells at all levels. Damaging spells, invisibility, local and distant teleportation, magically unlocking things, you name it. Read your spells carefully and be creative. Have fun!

Mayybeeee I tell the player their character has this momentary flash of insight of how things would have gone, were things different. If enough time has passed that would make un-doing this complicated, we simply accept the action and keep the rule in mind going forward. \n\n* Respeccing your character. I am lenient on this, because sometimes you have this idea for a character in your head, but you play them for some number of levels and it isn't really playing out how you expected. In that time, you discovered a class or subclass that much better fits the idea you had. This RARELY results in a wizard becoming a fighter or something that dramatic, but if it does we try to come up with an in-game explanation. Instead, it's usually like a Swashbuckler Rogue becoming a College of Swords Bard. As far as the \"plot\" is concerned, that character was just always a bard. This has yet to cause any plot consistency problems. \n\n* Carrying a character over from the end of a campaign to the start of another. I assume this means, taking a 10th level character from the end of Curse of Strahd, with the intention of playing them in Dragon Heist, which is a Level 1 to 5 campaign. There are a few ways to handle this. Maybe this low level campaign is in the past? Maybe it DOES take place after Strahd but something cause the player to lose their powers, abilities, and items like in a Metroid game? It could take some thinking but can usually be done fairly cleanly. \n\n* Last one that I think warrents a mention is a, \"Something happened last session, and there is no way me or my character could return to the table because of it.\" An extreme, super unfortunate example is something like sexual assault occurring in-game. In such a situation, we usually have an out of game discussion about it, completely wipe the event from the continuity of the game, and if needed we kick the offending player. \n\nThese retcons are not common for us, but when they come up they are generally easily managed.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like retconning comes in a few flavors.
