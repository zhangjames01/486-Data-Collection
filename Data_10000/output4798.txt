Download an app where you can track your progress, or chart it. It can be almost anything. Yoga, running, weightlifting, dancing or my favourite cycling or anything. 5 months ago I started working out after a 10 years break. Anyone can. Today i look forward to get out or to spin class to work out, because i use apps who tracks my heart rate at give me data to show it's working. I can cycle harder for longer now and it's so motivating. Set a goal for yourself, mine is to cycle for 7 hours a day for 4 days in August on a vacation. \n\nThe other hobby is for fun, something you can talk about with a passion. It's okay if you indulge in working out and want to talk about that but come on, it's pretty tedious for others to hear about it all day. Filmwatching, mtg, knitting, special effects makeup, the Olympics, study to become a wine conesur (spelling?) whatever. Something you enjoy, maybe something where you can meet someone new and interesting? \n\nI'm a couple years older than you, and people around me are not starstruck by instagrampretty glam girls anymore, we need substance, confidence and fun people to talk to. Working out will give you a new relationship with your body, to see it as a fun tool to use and shapr to reach your goals. That will in turn make both your body and your mind to become and appear fitter and more attractive to others. \n\nOh and delete tinder. That's a sea of narcissistic people who will make you feel devalued.

Download an app where you can track your progress, or chart it. It can be almost anything. Yoga, running, weightlifting, dancing or my favourite cycling or anything. 5 months ago I started working out after a 10 years break. Anyone can. Today i look forward to get out or to spin class to work out, because i use apps who tracks my heart rate at give me data to show it&amp;#39;s working. I can cycle harder for longer now and it&amp;#39;s so motivating. Set a goal for yourself, mine is to cycle for 7 hours a day for 4 days in August on a vacation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other hobby is for fun, something you can talk about with a passion. It&amp;#39;s okay if you indulge in working out and want to talk about that but come on, it&amp;#39;s pretty tedious for others to hear about it all day. Filmwatching, mtg, knitting, special effects makeup, the Olympics, study to become a wine conesur (spelling?) whatever. Something you enjoy, maybe something where you can meet someone new and interesting? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a couple years older than you, and people around me are not starstruck by instagrampretty glam girls anymore, we need substance, confidence and fun people to talk to. Working out will give you a new relationship with your body, to see it as a fun tool to use and shapr to reach your goals. That will in turn make both your body and your mind to become and appear fitter and more attractive to others. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and delete tinder.
