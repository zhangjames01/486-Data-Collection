into protection 1 if you get it.This would let people get optimal enchants on there gear much quicker.With this in place there could be the mob limit plugin put in that would only allow you to have x amount of mobs in 1 chunk.It might still cause a little lag but thats the reason for donations and upgrading server hardware :p.I mean what server can run 20 tick rate 100% of the time with 0 lag on a crazy high FPS non stop, its a nice goal but it can't possibly be achieved without a insane hardware for the server or removing some natural elements of the game.Now getting back to the part of enchants....being able to enchant at level 30 only and a max armor enchant of prot 1 would solve a lot of things.Unlike a set of full protection 2 protection 1 can be gotten at level 1 and dose not max out the amount of EPF you can have.This causes more damage to be taken and less time to enchant.Now to get on to tools, at level 30 tool enchants you can grab your basic silk touch and i believe up to unbreaking 3 and efficiency 3.As for fortune enchant level 1 would be common level 2 would be rare and level 3 would be VERY RARE I'm talking 0.24% chance rare.People may say \"But now we can't get enough diamonds\" well your sort of wrong sort of right, With protection weekend it won't absorb much damage = less damage to your armor and getting more bang for you diamonds which ultimately = less diamonds.As for the rest of things you use diamonds on you won't waste 400 diamond son swords that you keep going for a OP sharp V fire 2 looting 3 that you have a 1.24% chance of getting.This would ultimately lower the same game stats to what it is now on a more noob friendly level.Sharpness 3 is the highest sharpness possible at that level and a sharpness 3 fire 2 is only 3.98% at level 30, going back to the sharp V fire 2 looting 3 god sword its about the same % as getting a sharp 3 fire 2 looting 3 at level 30.Add a few potion delays and maybe instant health 2 again and over all this would be a nice noob friendly add on :).(Bows would need a nerd though as they already can deal about 6.5 hearts to prot 2 in prot 1 thats a 1 hit)\n\nNow to the problem of getting more people to events.Events of course would have to have a tone down in mob damage and rewards.Some things that could be good would be getting a fortune 3 possibly or maybe just maybe a sharp 4 fire 2.(this seems op to protection 1 but believe me coming from a server were there was no grinding and people had 1 sword they loved for life they got from donating this being a sharp V prot 1 let you live and win if you knew what you were doing)Another big prize at this point i would say would also be ender pearls since looting 3 would be the best looting you could get and it only having a 3% chance would be very good for a lot of factions that go through a stack a fight.With rewards that are good editions to even the newest of teams that a lot of new played could compete for would be very strongly to adding more action in events.\n\nTL;DR: Go fucking read it its got some good points in it!\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false,
