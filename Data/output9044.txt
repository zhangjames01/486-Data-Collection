Simply put, the concept of swimming is a \"naive\" way to explain what a submarine does as it is based on a **familiar** behaviour from the natural world. Living beings move through the water by \"swimming\" i.e. moving their body in a way as to propel themselves. \"Swimming\" is not a \"good\" description of what a submarine actually does.

What a submarine does has no commonly known analogue in nature although the end result is the same (motion through water).\n\nIn the same respect, \"thinking\" as we understand it from the \"natural\" world so far may not be the proper way to describe the internal processes of an AI, despite the fact that the end results (results, meaning, answers, questions, etc) may be the same. When it comes to AI the term \"thinking\" may be naive, constricted or outdated.\n\n\"Thinking\" is also a poorly defined concept. If we admit that a human brain \"thinks\" can we say that a neuron thinks? At what scale does a collection of firing neurons become a thinking brain? If a transistor does not \"think\", when does a collection of firing transistors become a \"thinking\" AI? As a computer scientist, Dijkstra is aware of transistors (and I presume neurons).\n\nDijkstra points out that the question is ultimately meaningless and merely the result of a semantic misunderstanding, caused by our inability to consider alternate definitions or analogues to \"thinking\".
