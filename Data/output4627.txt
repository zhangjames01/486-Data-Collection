Do you also think that they have cooked the books? \n\nI dont think you understand how irrelevant this is.

Moralizing economics and saying to their own citizens \"they deserved this suffering, we are not doing anything wrong\".

If the debt was Greece's issue, what has changed, the debt is the same? Why do you think that there is a lot of talk about getting more countries(all them in poorer shape than Greece) into the EU/eurozone? These decisions are made based on political policy, not based on relatively small, short term economical issues.\n\nHow do you think Germany went from the sick man of Europe, to an exporting power house? By devaluing its currency(sharing a currency with poorer countries), by increasing its exports to other EU members(ez trade, ez access to debt for poorer members = more german exports) and by attracting human and monetary capital from the EU periphery(free movement of capital/people).\n\nIn all countries, there is a natural flow towards the core. The same principle is true for a union like the EU. Over time, capital and humans will flow towards the imperial core, as it is seen as a safer option. What does this mean for the periphery? The periphery gets fucked. This is also true for Greece for example, where the capital Athens keeps getting more and more powerful, with more people and capital.\n\nIn the case of a country, the government usually takes some steps to reduce that flow. After all, it isnt good to have parts of your country without any inhabitants or in extreme poverty. The government does this by reducing taxes and increasing spending in those regions, above what the tax income of those regions is. \n\nThe EU's equivalent measures are laughably small and irrelevant. This is by design, the countries still want to maintain their independence, etc. But in a proper union, like the USA, the federal government has an insanely bigger budget, more power and redistributes more wealth to its periphery. Remember all those american comments about how shitty the red states are because they get major benefits from the federal budget, while the blue states are the ones who contribute the most to the budget? The same thing is true for regions of countries within EU and the same should be true for country members within the EU, if we want EU to be a proper union.\n\nThe politicians and economists know this. But as i said, national identities are still pretty strong and no country want this. So why the fuck do we have a eurozone if we arent willing to do it? This half ass measure is the worst of both worlds. Why cant we have a normal EU without a eurozone? \n\nThe eurozone was not created based on economic theory, it was created as an extension of a political decision. A policy that would ultimately lead to a union similar to the US. It is a policy driven entity, not an economics driven one. Except when issues start appearing, everyone pretends it is just economics, you are on your own, good luck.\n\n&gt;You talked earlier about how the leftist government was purged as part of reforms - but the leftist government was the one cooking the books. Again, massive state sponsored financial fraud, just so that they could later shrug and say, \u201cToo late, you already let us in to your union, suckers! Tee hee!\u201d\n\nNo, it wasnt. There were 2 leftist parties. The one who governed Greece for decades(PASOK) and which cooked the books is almost a non entity now. A leftist party(SYRIZA), that used to get 3% votes, arose and became government for a term. This is the party i am talking about. This is the one that had a primary surplus budget. They were forced to basically go against all their promises and impose the harshest of economic measures, because the EU had cut them off the liquidity plan(that was available to the previous governments). It's a long story and they were far from perfect but it was different. \n\nFor the first time in the modern history of Greece, we had a new third party as government. Ultimately, they had to \"bend the knee\", go against their promises, in order to prevent the total collapse of Greece and this cost them a lot of votes. \n\nSYRIZA wanted to antagonize the EU, so the EU were extremely uncharitable and they went out of their way to fuck with SYRIZA, just so that SYRIZA would eventually lose the elections. Just look how charitable the EU became once the right wing party ND became government(which as i said was the main culprit of the economic collapse, the debt ballooned during their government), it's ridiculous.\n\nNow you might say \"of course the EU did that, you just said that SYRIZA decided to antagonize the EU, there are consequences for that\". Well, if thats the reason, then it isnt about economics, it is about politics. And do you think that this paints a positive description for the EU, a union where an external entity can destroy your country because of politics? Why does the EU exist? Is it not to avoid wars? Do you think this kind of thing is productive towards that goal?\n\nBut dont worry, Greece will not go to war over this. Greece was just mentally broken after this. Everyone is dead inside with no hope on the horizon. This is why slaves almost never fight back, they know that it wont make a difference. Greece decided to fight back and almost literally died for it. I am sure this wont create any resentment that could be abused by a future greekstyle Orban.

Well, if thats the reason, then it isnt about economics, it is about politics. And do you think that this paints a positive description for the EU, a union where an external entity can destroy your country because of politics? Why does the EU exist? Is it not to avoid wars? Do you think this kind of thing is productive towards that goal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But dont worry, Greece will not go to war over this. Greece was just mentally broken after this. Everyone is dead inside with no hope on the horizon. This is why slaves almost never fight back, they know that it wont make a difference. Greece decided to fight back and almost literally died for it. I am sure this wont create any resentment that could be abused by a future greekstyle Orban. Especially as Greece has fucked up demographics and tons of young, educated and liberal greeks are leaving the country(i am not one of them btw).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11l2rye", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/11l2rye/greeces_gdp_grew_59_in_2022/jbdkyi3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11l2rye/greeces_gdp_grew_59_in_2022/", "name": "t1_jbdkyi3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678260251.0, "created_utc": 1678260251.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://greekcitytimes.com/2023/03/07/greece-gdp-5-9-in-2022/"}}], "before": null}}
