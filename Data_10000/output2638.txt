How would it go if you told him \"sometimes I worry that I'm acting juvenile or annoying around your friends, because I'm nervous and want them to like me, and am maybe trying too hard, does it look that way from the outside or is that just the nervousness talking?\"\n\nAlternatively, if this is something you can't change, you could try something more like \"hey, I could use some reassurance that I'm not acting weird around your friends, because I'm worried I'm trying too hard and it's annoying them instead\"\n\nWith either of those, he has enough information to know what the problem is and what you need from him. There are times in partnered life when you need a hug or a reassure or just to be told that you aren't the wrong one in the conversation you're having with your cousin, and being able to ask for that directly is the best thing about being in a good partnership. If I phrase things open-ended, then I want my wife's perspective and don't expect to melt into a puddle of feelings about things, but if I ask for reassurance or an outside perspective check then if she thinks I'm in the wrong she'll be more gentle because I will have said up front that I'm feeling insecure about it.\n\nMy case is a little different, in that my sense of 'normal' has always been skewed thanks to my upbringing, which made it take even longer to get the adhd diagnosed since I was used to being a little out of step with everyone else. I'm used to checking in with others, as long as they're close friends, a little more about 'hey, is thing A normal?' and I've found that while it's a little bit awkward at first, it rapidly becomes something people just think of as a part of you, they get used to weighing in without it causing a meltdown, and it's so much better than questioning every moment of your day on into the night. But it's less awkward for the other person if it's phrased as a narrow question that has a possible explanation for things built-in so they don't have to try and come up with a polite way to say that you *acted* annoying or weird but that doesn't mean that you *are* annoying or weird.\n\nIt still is possible that from the outside you're acting perfectly normal and no one there knows how much you're dwelling on this. If that's the case, getting a quick 'nope' will be so reassuring, and over time I've needed to ask that question less often.\n\nIf someone hangs out with you when they don't have to, then they are enjoying some aspect of hanging out with you. His friends could hang out with him without you, so if they keep willingly coming back to events where they know you'll be then you aren't as annoying or cringy as it sounds like you fear. Take yes for an answer, and trust that other people are capable of making their opinions known and taking action on those. None of them benefit from secretly seething about how awful you are while going to every event they know you'll attend. If they choose to spend time with you then they like you at least enough to choose to spend time with you, because that's not required of them, grownups get to choose with whom they interact.

How would it go if you told him &amp;quot;sometimes I worry that I&amp;#39;m acting juvenile or annoying around your friends, because I&amp;#39;m nervous and want them to like me, and am maybe trying too hard, does it look that way from the outside or is that just the nervousness talking?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if this is something you can&amp;#39;t change, you could try something more like &amp;quot;hey, I could use some reassurance that I&amp;#39;m not acting weird around your friends, because I&amp;#39;m worried I&amp;#39;m trying too hard and it&amp;#39;s annoying them instead&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With either of those, he has enough information to know what the problem is and what you need from him. There are times in partnered life when you need a hug or a reassure or just to be told that you aren&amp;#39;t the wrong one in the conversation you&amp;#39;re having with your cousin, and being able to ask for that directly is the best thing about being in a good partnership. If I phrase things open-ended, then I want my wife&amp;#39;s perspective and don&amp;#39;t expect to melt into a puddle of feelings about things, but if I ask for reassurance or an outside perspective check then if she thinks I&amp;#39;m in the wrong she&amp;#39;ll be more gentle because I will have said up front that I&amp;#39;m feeling insecure about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My case is a little different, in that my sense of &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; has always been skewed thanks to my upbringing, which made it take even longer to get the adhd diagnosed since I was used to being a little out of step with everyone else. I&amp;#39;m used to checking in with others, as long as they&amp;#39;re close friends, a little more about &amp;#39;hey, is thing A normal?&amp;#39; and I&amp;#39;ve found that while it&amp;#39;s a little bit awkward at first, it rapidly becomes something people just think of as a part of you, they get used to weighing in without it causing a meltdown, and it&amp;#39;s so much better than questioning every moment of your day on into the night. But it&amp;#39;s less awkward for the other person if it&amp;#39;s phrased as a narrow question that has a possible explanation for things built-in so they don&amp;#39;t have to try and come up with a polite way to say that you &lt;em&gt;acted&lt;/em&gt; annoying or weird but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; annoying or weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It still is possible that from the outside you&amp;#39;re acting perfectly normal and no one there knows how much you&amp;#39;re dwelling on this. If that&amp;#39;s the case, getting a quick &amp;#39;nope&amp;#39; will be so reassuring, and over time I&amp;#39;ve needed to ask that question less often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone hangs out with you when they don&amp;#39;t have to, then they are enjoying some aspect of hanging out with you. His friends could hang out with him without you, so if they keep willingly coming back to events where they know you&amp;#39;ll be then you aren&amp;#39;t as annoying or cringy as it sounds like you fear. Take yes for an answer, and trust that other people are capable of making their opinions known and taking action on those. None of them benefit from secretly seething about how awful you are while going to every event they know you&amp;#39;ll attend.
