We're expecting some amount of entertainment when a federal judge reacts to these shenanigans.\n- Also in Florida, Craig has been [ordered](/r/bsv/comments/11gojm9/april_fools_is_less_funny_when_you_know_the_joke/) to complete a \"debtor fact information sheet\" to disclose his financial assets by April 1st to W&amp;K, to help them collect what they're owed. Craig's team has been desperately trying to stop that from happening, and is currently appealing that order. Some here are speculating that this is a delaying tactic to give Craig time to play shell games with his assets.\n- In the UK, Craig was [granted the right to appeal](/r/bsv/comments/10si1le/tulip_appeal_judgement/) on his pineapple \"fiduciary\" lawsuit against the devs, which forces additional financial costs upon a group of people he has wished out loud to destroy.\n- Also in the UK, [Craig loses his McCormack case](/r/bsv/comments/zrpgk9/the_final_judgement_in_my_case_against_csw_has/) in every way that matters. [The Judge's order](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Wright-v-McCormack-Final-Judgment-for-Hand-Down.pdf) provides more quotes documenting Craig's dishonest character. McCormack is still out \u00a3900K in court fees because the UK court system is awesome. Craig's actions in the case are referred to another judge for contempt proceedings.\n- Also in the UK, Cobra continues to have no rights and [get shat on by the UK court system](/r/bsv/comments/z4d5yt/pseudonymous_claimant_debarred_from_proceedings/), much to Craig's delight.\n- Still in the UK, some documents dropped on the [Craig vs Kraken](/r/bsv/comments/z13s29/wrights_lawsuit_against_kraken/) case.\n- In Antigua, Craig is moving forward with [defamation proceedings against Roger Ver](/r/bsv/comments/11dn7fb/dr_craig_wins_against_roger_ver/) (A case he started after losing, appealing and losing again his libel case against Ver in the UK.)\n\nSocial media nonsense:\n\n- A group called \"Lightning Sharks\", paid for by Calvin Ayre, rose to prominence in the BSV ecosystem.
