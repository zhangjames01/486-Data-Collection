I don&amp;#39;t think any of them should be on hold, but I do think that you&amp;#39;ll continue to have difficulties until each is thoroughly addressed, for instance, even if I&amp;#39;ve been taught every social nuance perfectly, it would not matter if I could not hear the person correctly over the background. Even if I knew what was appropriate to say in a situation, if I do not know what the correct situation means, such as when and why a person would be sad and what sad is, it would be nothing more than script reading and some would notice and it would hurt me socially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My last paragraph stipulated my personal theory that even if an autistic did the very best they are capable of, with the best of help, they&amp;#39;ll still notice their different, still run into non autistics who are ignorant or even simply unkind.  Unless non autistics stop expecting other people of the same culture to be automatically aware of things or automatically understand certain things, there will be times when some autistics feel like outsiders or observers or inadequate etc. This stands true not just for autistics, but pretty much everyone that feels they don&amp;#39;t fit within the narrow band of &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The definition of normal I was using here is the range of &amp;quot;__&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot; most common within one&amp;#39;s own culture and thought by the most number of people to be ordinary. &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;___&amp;quot; may be behaviors, actions, possessions, and anything else that people pass judgement on as either typical and ordinary or unusual. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_vuoc5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/autism/comments/vuoc5/what_is_a_cure/c585g9s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/vuoc5/what_is_a_cure/", "name": "t1_c585g9s", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/autism", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1341177335.0, "created_utc": 1341177335.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/vuoc5/what_is_a_cure/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhs6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What is a cure?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "autism", "link_author": "that1account", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c57zjp0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Lokilost", "num_comments": 48, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vuoc5", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_53xmt", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Assuming you mean a total cure, it would mean a total loss of the core person, the person you know would be gone, and someone else would be there instead.
