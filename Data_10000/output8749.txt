It&amp;#39;s not that Trump&amp;#39;s tariffs don&amp;#39;t give BMW reason to be glad to build in China, it&amp;#39;s that they were already going to do it anyway and he&amp;#39;s not helping the situation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All we&amp;#39;re arguing about is timing. BMW was going to do this anyway. As for Tesla I haven&amp;#39;t looked into it and couldn&amp;#39;t say.
