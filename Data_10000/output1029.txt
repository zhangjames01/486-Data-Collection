the reason being that i have severe crippling insecurities regarding my life and my person (and even admiting *that* much, near-anonymously and over the internet, gives me a touch of anxiety).  see, here's the thing, i will go to extraordinary lengths trying to convince others that their lives are worthwhile, that their daily accomplishments are substantial, and their personal struggles are legitimate, because they are.  but simultaneously, i can't help but feel worthless, unaccomplished, and without cause for complaint.  it's like being gifted with third eye enlightenment to see the good in everyone, except for a glaring blind spot over myself.  the irony/hypocracy of the sitation is not lost on me.  i make efforts to be more open about myself with others (case in point), but it's still a major discomfort.  anyhow, that's enough background on me - moving on in the conversation.\n\nbased on the context of traumatic hardships and adequate periods of grief, 4-5 months is indeed a very brief timespan.  and the effect of such difficulties is amplified when you take into consideration that you were losing every element of your personal support network.  i mean, under ideal circumstances, if your boyfriend/girlfriend breaks up with you, you can rely on your friends to take you out, get you drunk, and talk shit about your ex.  if your friends turn on you, you can rely on family to provide comfort and the promise to never abandon you.  if your family are unbearable, you can rely on your boyfriend/girlfriend for a loving embrace, a shoulder to cry on, and the promise to make things better.  in a healthy network, when one support pillar goes, you can depend a little more heavily on your other supports until you've regained your balance and stabilized your footing.  but when every leg gets cut out from underneath you, you land face first in the mud and it takes for-friggin-ever to stand up again.\n\nthe opening of old wounds generally isn't helpful in these kinds of situations.  not that it's ever a rational thought process to do it.  i used to have this tendency as a kid to pick at scabs wherever i could reach them.  i fully understood at the time i was making it worse, but i really couldn't help myself (it was just too tempting).  i eventually learned restraint by covering scabs with bandages and keeping my fingernails short and useless.  along that same vein, i've discovered for myself that there is tragic futility in seeking closure from recently ended relationships.  it's never as helpful to the healing process as i imagine and tends to just exacerbate the situation (as each closing answer inevitably gives rise a dozen new questions, all in need of their own separate closure).  consequentially, i find it an absolute necessity to delete my ex-girlfriend from every conceivable contact list as soon as the break-up is official.\n\nmy analysis of your ex: kind of a douche.  i mean, dumping your girlfriend over the fact she likes anime and video games and comic books?  wut an ass!  seriously, if a guy simply can't accpt your interests and passions, he's not worth the time it'd take to piss on his head.  if that's the justification he gave for breaking up with you, he's 100% pure douchebag.  however, i will admit that genuine incompatibilities of \"maturity\" are legitimate cause for break-ups, but \"maturity\" encompasses about a million different aspects of one's personality, so unless he (respectfully) cited real examples of maturity discrepancy (e.g. incompatible sexual expectations, divergant professional goals, incoherent communication styles, etc.), he's being a douchbag prick and claiming \"maturity\" just to condescend.  but alas, such discrepancies are exactly the type of answers that would spawn further pressing questions (no closure for me *sigh*).  in any case, i say good riddance.\n\non a side gripe, it must be nice to be a hot chick.  having to initiate every romantic endeavor in one's life is exhausting (and absolutely brutal on one's long term self-esteem).  being pursued every once in a while would be such a welcome change of pace.\n\ni'm really sorry about your friends.  i've been through that situation on both sides of the conflict, and it sucks no matter what.  there's only so much an individual can do to supress their personality to accomodate friends, and friends ultimately have to do what's best for themselves and their own social sanity;

thread post.  your struggles are the topic which brought me here in the first place.  so the fact that we&amp;#39;d be predominantly talking about you is kind of a given.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and besides, i tend to eschew any and all opportunities for personal disclosure; the reason being that i have severe crippling insecurities regarding my life and my person (and even admiting &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much, near-anonymously and over the internet, gives me a touch of anxiety).  see, here&amp;#39;s the thing, i will go to extraordinary lengths trying to convince others that their lives are worthwhile, that their daily accomplishments are substantial, and their personal struggles are legitimate, because they are.  but simultaneously, i can&amp;#39;t help but feel worthless, unaccomplished, and without cause for complaint.  it&amp;#39;s like being gifted with third eye enlightenment to see the good in everyone, except for a glaring blind spot over myself.  the irony/hypocracy of the sitation is not lost on me.  i make efforts to be more open about myself with others (case in point), but it&amp;#39;s still a major discomfort.  anyhow, that&amp;#39;s enough background on me - moving on in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;based on the context of traumatic hardships and adequate periods of grief, 4-5 months is indeed a very brief timespan.  and the effect of such difficulties is amplified when you take into consideration that you were losing every element of your personal support network.  i mean, under ideal circumstances, if your boyfriend/girlfriend breaks up with you, you can rely on your friends to take you out, get you drunk, and talk shit about your ex.  if your friends turn on you, you can rely on family to provide comfort and the promise to never abandon you.  if your family are unbearable, you can rely on your boyfriend/girlfriend for a loving embrace, a shoulder to cry on, and the promise to make things better.  in a healthy network, when one support pillar goes, you can depend a little more heavily on your other supports until you&amp;#39;ve regained your balance and stabilized your footing.  but when every leg gets cut out from underneath you, you land face first in the mud and it takes for-friggin-ever to stand up again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the opening of old wounds generally isn&amp;#39;t helpful in these kinds of situations.  not that it&amp;#39;s ever a rational thought process to do it.  i used to have this tendency as a kid to pick at scabs wherever i could reach them.  i fully understood at the time i was making it worse, but i really couldn&amp;#39;t help myself (it was just too tempting).  i eventually learned restraint by covering scabs with bandages and keeping my fingernails short and useless.  along that same vein, i&amp;#39;ve discovered for myself that there is tragic futility in seeking closure from recently ended relationships.  it&amp;#39;s never as helpful to the healing process as i imagine and tends to just exacerbate the situation (as each closing answer inevitably gives rise a dozen new questions, all in need of their own separate closure).  consequentially, i find it an absolute necessity to delete my ex-girlfriend from every conceivable contact list as soon as the break-up is official.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;my analysis of your ex: kind of a douche.  i mean, dumping your girlfriend over the fact she likes anime and video games and comic books?  wut an ass!  seriously, if a guy simply can&amp;#39;t accpt your interests and passions, he&amp;#39;s not worth the time it&amp;#39;d take to piss on his head.  if that&amp;#39;s the justification he gave for breaking up with you, he&amp;#39;s 100% pure douchebag.  however, i will admit that genuine incompatibilities of &amp;quot;maturity&amp;quot; are legitimate cause for break-ups, but &amp;quot;maturity&amp;quot; encompasses about a million different aspects of one&amp;#39;s personality, so unless he (respectfully) cited real examples of maturity discrepancy (e.g. incompatible sexual expectations, divergant professional goals, incoherent communication styles, etc.), he&amp;#39;s being a douchbag prick and claiming &amp;quot;maturity&amp;quot; just to condescend.  but alas, such discrepancies are exactly the type of answers that would spawn further pressing questions (no closure for me &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;).  in any case, i say good riddance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;on a side gripe, it must be nice to be a hot chick.  having to initiate every romantic endeavor in one&amp;#39;s life is exhausting (and absolutely brutal on one&amp;#39;s long term self-esteem).  being pursued every once in a while would be such a welcome change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m really sorry about your friends.  i&amp;#39;ve been through that situation on both sides of the conflict, and it sucks no matter what.  there&amp;#39;s only so much an individual can do to supress their personality to accomodate friends, and friends ultimately have to do what&amp;#39;s best for themselves and their own social sanity; and sometimes that leaves people out in the cold.  mind you, just because i understand the difficulty my former friends faced when they struggled with the idea of abandoning me, doesn&amp;#39;t mean i didn&amp;#39;t hate their scum sucking disloyal guts once they finally did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but having this one friend sounds very special.  being supported daily by someone who accepts you despite your character flaws is truly invaluable.  they are a very rare breed and worth their weight in gold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;parents are just impossible, by definition.  they&amp;#39;re the roommates you can&amp;#39;t evict;

 really?).  but in the context of your current struggles, it&amp;#39;s just so incredibly dangerous.  i mean, if your blackout shoplifting abilities aren&amp;#39;t up to your sober skill level, you&amp;#39;re running a pretty high risk of getting caught, which may result in some very long term penalties for your future.  so i do think it is absolutely the best thing that it&amp;#39;s securely locked away from access.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;your symptoms and effects may be ever changing, but for the most part they seem to be moving in the overall right direction (albeit over a somewhat rocky path, but that&amp;#39;s normal for a lot of people treating mental illness).  you&amp;#39;ve given up a lot of short-term solutions to your depression in favor of yet unseen long-term health, and that is certainly not easy.  on a personalized note, i miss pot and alcohol... a lot (as well as the social interactions that came with it).  but right now, i recognize that i need stability in my chemistry in order for my medications to actually be effective (far more than i need a few hours of self-medicated comfort and artificial interpersonal connections).  affecting these life changes is incredibly significant.  the rest of the world may not see it, but making active decisions to improve one&amp;#39;s life (no matter how minor) when your entire brain is wired to believe you&amp;#39;re worthless and that your existance has no value, is monumental.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;long replies aren&amp;#39;t nearly as long as really really long replies (don&amp;#39;t feel obligated to respond in these ever escalating comments if you don&amp;#39;t want to.  i won&amp;#39;t be offended.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1br6i7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/1br6i7/depression_and_kleptomania/c9abwqb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1br6i7/depression_and_kleptomania/", "name": "t1_c9abwqb", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1365357589.0, "created_utc": 1365357589.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1br6i7/depression_and_kleptomania/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqqf", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Depression is humiliating", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "depression", "link_author": "Seamoneyyy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c99lnm5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "gakirat", "num_comments": 115, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1bq90v", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_75pww", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "thank you.  your words are perfect.  thank you.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;thank you.  your words are perfect.  thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1bq90v", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/depression/comments/1bq90v/depression_is_humiliating/c99lnm5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1bq90v/depression_is_humiliating/", "name": "t1_c99lnm5", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/depression", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1365238181.0, "created_utc": 1365238181.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1bq90v/depression_is_humiliating/"}}], "before": null}}
