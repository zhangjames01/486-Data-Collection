As a sysadmin, your work day starts at 5pm. You are there from 9am until 5pm to offer support, and then you are there from 5pm until 10pm to make changes, improvements, reboot things...etc.\n\nHopefully these little tips will get you moving:\n\n* **Cludges and bodges are bad.** It's so easy to make a little tool or write a little app to accomplish X or Y or make Z work with Q. Work hard to fight this urge. Buying a tool with support from the vendor is always preferable to rolling your own. **Vendor support.** Very important. Without it you are on your own.\n* **You are a cost centre.** In business terms, you suck away money and offer nothing in return. Infrastructure is seen by businesses as sitting next to Facilities or Estates. You spend all the money and deliver nothing tangible. Don't fight it.\n* **Fight to do things the Correct Way.** Even if it's more painful in the short term, it'll be worth it in the long term. I've worked with a lot of developers who would happily disable UAC and poke holes in firewalls if it meant getting something working. They would do this with the best intentions, and they would always intend to clean up after themselves afterwards. Afterwards never came. If you have an application that requires UAC being disabled, you have the wrong application. If your software won't run for normal users under normal user access, you have the wrong software. If the developer you are working with can't understand why you won't enable TCP 25 outbound for all internal IPs, you have the wrong developer. Servers have redundant PSUs for a reason. Plug them into seperate UPSs.\n* **Take a step back.** It's easy as a developer to get lost in the nitty-gritty of how this plugs into that and what protocol this uses. Stop. Take a deep breath. Remember that you have responsibility for the entire system, not just a small part of it. Draw diagrams of it. Try and jot down which bits and pieces talk to each other. Make sure you have configuration backups of all of your network equipment. Make sure you have backups of your servers. Make sure you have spare hardware on the shelf if possible. Document things before you break them, not afterwards. Make sure you know who has physical access to your comms room. Make sure you have suppliers phone numbers in case you lose your internet connection, power...etc. Make sure you have defined procedures for things like user account creation and access removal (see points above about bodges being bad and fighting to do things correctly).\n* **Keep things the same.** Rather than having a Cisco 2960 plugged into a 3com switch plugged into something else, why not have all Cisco? Or all HP? Make sure you've got configuration backups, then you only need to keep one spare on the shelf. This goes for everything: servers, user equipment, mobile phones. Treat everyone the same. As soon as you buy your favourite girl in marketing a slightly bigger monitor than everyone else, you are in a whole new world of pain.\n* **Security.** Security, security, security. If your network gets hacked into, you can never trust any component of it ever again. How can you prove beyond reasonable doubt that the binaries on that server are un-molested and as the vendor intended? You can't. If you are hacked into, you have the nuke your environment from orbit and restore data from clean backups. Security is not an excuse to not do things; you have a responsibility to the business as an expert to keep your data environment as secure as you can possibly make it. The [PCI requirements](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pci_saq_d_v2.doc) are a fairly good place to start.\n* **Monitoring.** Monitor the important things. Don't overload yourself with information. It's easy to set up an SNMP alert every time a network connection is broken, but the reality is that at 4:59pm this will just result in you being flooded with emails telling you people are unplugging their laptops.\n* **Take holidays.** Chances are you are going to turn into a real arsehole to be around, and that's not fair on family and friends. Take holiday. Don't turn into a \"you against the world\" idiot who takes on far more responsibility than he really should and gets taken advantage of by the business. People who run businesses aren't stupid; if you are going to be all gung-ho and take on loads of work for no extra money, that's fine by them.\n* **It's OK to ask for help.** It's OK to speak to your boss and say \"I think this needs some attention but I don't know anything about it. The company who support it will come and have a look at it for \u00a3650 a day, I think we should do it.\"\n* **Vendor support!** Don't forget! Get a support agreement on everything. If you have servers out of warranty, replace them. You need to be in a position where you can say to whoever you report to \"if anything fails, we can have a new one tomorrow/next business day, I can blow the config back on to it and we'll be back up and running.\" If you have to scrabble around trying to find an absolete bit of kit on ebay when yours fails, you are going to be killed to death.\n* **Read all the things.** Read /r/vmware , read /r/netsec . Go on training courses, buy books, take old equipment home to play with and take apart. Put ESXi on a spare server and play with VLANs and DHCP proxies.\n* Last but not least: throw a thread up on /r/sysadmin if you need help or advice, and make sure you check in regularly. There are **lots** of caveats and gotchas when working with some of this kit, it's nice to have them happen to other people before you discover them yourself.\n\n", "edited": 1404292263.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Infrastructure manager"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I simply don&amp;#39;t enjoy programming commercially because when I go\nhome I can&amp;#39;t work on my pet projects after 9 hours of straight coding\nand without my pet projects I can&amp;#39;t continue my hobby as an\nindependent game developer (which one day might turn into a career).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will not be going home after 9 hours.
