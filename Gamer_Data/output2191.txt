Then it&amp;#39;s a gentlemens handshake.\n2. Send your strong lanes against their strong lanes. This way you won&amp;#39;t get completely destroyed \n3.accept that there are gonna be completely bs pics that you simply can&amp;#39;t deal with and just move on. Ideally you should be playing with friends so you can FF and go next because if it&amp;#39;s pointless and attrition doesn&amp;#39;t work then sometimes the smarter solution is to just give up. Remember you are supposed to be having fun, but if you are getting hammered then what&amp;#39;s the point. \n4.hidden stupid picks that people don&amp;#39;t expect and that are actually really strong. Asol, Annie, leona, rakan, azir, rumble. Enchanter supports like lulu and nami make the lane really easy for whoever is playing with you. Not sure if  some of these are meta actually but oh well. \n5. If you aren&amp;#39;t having fun don&amp;#39;t play. It&amp;#39;s pointless to give in if you are pressured by friends. Because all you will end up doing is hating the game mode even more. Just go do something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_gl1dh4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gl1dh4/how_can_people_enjoy_that_much_urf/fqw3lzc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gl1dh4/how_can_people_enjoy_that_much_urf/", "name": "t1_fqw3lzc", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/leagueoflegends", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1589691897.0, "created_utc": 1589691897.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gl1dh4/how_can_people_enjoy_that_much_urf/"}}], "before": null}}
