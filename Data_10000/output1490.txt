The strategies you listed are all fine conditionally.  If I&amp;#39;m playing one of my CEDH decks in a pod of seasoned players by all means fire away with your MLD.  If we&amp;#39;re playing low power/ultra Budget decks with some brand new players using mint/lightly altered precons you should not bring MLD to the table, even if they give you the okay they might not understand what you&amp;#39;re asking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These strategies you mentioned catch hate because they require a degree of nuance with how and when they should be used. There is not enough trust and wherewithal within the community to declare open season on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_z6o82q", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/EDH/comments/z6o82q/did_you_know_that_what_you_consider_fun_is_not/iy3ystw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/z6o82q/did_you_know_that_what_you_consider_fun_is_not/", "name": "t1_iy3ystw", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/EDH", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1669651412.0, "created_utc": 1669651412.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/z6o82q/did_you_know_that_what_you_consider_fun_is_not/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2scee", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "My first Commander event was eye opening\u2026", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "EDH", "link_author": "SavageSean75", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iy3trck", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "FalconPunchline", "num_comments": 58, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iy3nasy", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_53svk", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; But then again I feel like that puts a timer on you and your opponents then know to target you and have you dealt with by then?\n\nThe idea is that you match expectations and decks upfront.
