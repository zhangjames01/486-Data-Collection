Legal-ese can be difficult to read (especially the older language they use in House of Lords or Privy Council cases), but it will really pay off in terms of wrestling with the principles and facts, as well as once you start practicing as a lawyer.\n\nOnce you start to read cases, you start to pick up on how to read them, what parts you should focus on and what parts you can skim over. They will become a lot easier to read the more you do it. They all follow a similar structure (order may vary):\n\n* Background and facts\n* Prior legal proceedings\n* Legal issues\n* Summary of relevant legislation and principles\n* Reasoning\n* Conclusion and orders\n\nHere's how I tend to read cases now:\n\n1. Skim over the facts and get a sense of what the case is about\n2. See what the legal issue is.\n3. Based on my existing knowledge, see what I think the legal answer is and why.\n4. Jump to the bottom and see what the Court's decision was.\n5. If it's a new area of law, I read through the summary of legislation and cases to get a good idea of the key legal principles at that time. If I know it well, I skim it just to see if there's any cases I haven't haerd of before and to get a snapshot of what they contribute.\n6. Go back to where the judge's reasoning starts and understand each step of the process.\n\n* If they reached a different conclusion, I try and understand exactly how and why they reached their conclusion, such as where my reasoning was different from theirs. This is usually something that I take note of for future.\n* Even if I got the same answer, I still work through their reasoning, focusing on the aspects that I'm weaker on or that differ from my process.\n\nThe biggest benefit of reaidng cases for yourself is that you understand the factual differences and different legal tests and principles that can be applied. That way, when you attempt a problem question,'re better able to decide which case is more relevant and explain why. You really miss out on these aspects when you read case usmmaries instead of reading cases yourself, which can impact your ability to answer problem questions well.\n\nThat said, law textbooks are helpful for getting the legal principles ina nutshell without having to work through a judgment yourself. They also provide helpful background and insight into policy issues that will be important for answering law essays.\n\nProblem questions are still good for exam prep, but only once you understand the legislation, cases and principles in the subject. When doing a problem question, it's not only helpful to spot the legal issues, but also identifying which cases are most relevant and why. Problem questions tend to have facts that appeared in cases you've studied during the semester, so they're easy marks if you know your cases well. If you're struggling with certain parts of a problem question, those are areas of hte subject you should brush up on.\n\nHope this helps - just did a brain dump during my coffee break at work lol", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been out of Law school for a while, but one of my largest regrets was not reading cases that were assigned to me.

At the moment I take down my notes in Notion first, then I put a clean, summarised version in RemNote. I like to think of RemNote as my curated library whereas Notion is more of a filing cabinet since it has a lot more organisational features such as databases and properties.\n* **\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Zettelkasten** \\- I use a hybrid between the Zettelkasten system that was made popular in Zunke Arrens' book *How to Take Smart Notes* and Nick Mylo's IMF system. I basically keep 2 kinds of notes in my Zettelkasten folder:\n   * **\ud83c\udf33 Zettels/Permanent Notes** *-* These are the atomic notes that encompass a single idea that I condense from my Capture Notes. Each note is a document where I put down the notes, put links to other zettels/permanent notes and the capture notes which it relates to. If it's a quote, I use a portal to link back to the relevant Rem in its parent document.\n   * *\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Maps of Content* **- I create these notes as documents which basically encompass a particular topic or cluster of zettels. I link to the zettels which serve as entry points into a particular cluster. I also include links to other maps of content here.**\n\n**I keep all of my zettels and maps of content at the same level. It's a personal preference, but I do it so that I don't force some sort of hierarchy onto my permanent notes, because I want groups and clusters to naturally emerge as I accumulate more and more notes.**\n\nWhen I'm trying to navigate my knowledge base, I don't go through my Zettelkasten document, since it's got over 2000+ Rem now. I use my \"PKM Index\":\n\n* \ud83c\udf10 **PKM Index -** This is a document where I link to all the top-level maps of content from my Zettelkasten document.

At the moment I take down my notes in Notion first, then I put a clean, summarised version in RemNote. I like to think of RemNote as my curated library whereas Notion is more of a filing cabinet since it has a lot more organisational features such as databases and properties.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Zettelkasten&lt;/strong&gt; - I use a hybrid between the Zettelkasten system that was made popular in Zunke Arrens&amp;#39; book &lt;em&gt;How to Take Smart Notes&lt;/em&gt; and Nick Mylo&amp;#39;s IMF system. I basically keep 2 kinds of notes in my Zettelkasten folder:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83c\udf33 Zettels/Permanent Notes&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt; These are the atomic notes that encompass a single idea that I condense from my Capture Notes. Each note is a document where I put down the notes, put links to other zettels/permanent notes and the capture notes which it relates to. If it&amp;#39;s a quote, I use a portal to link back to the relevant Rem in its parent document.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Maps of Content&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;- I create these notes as documents which basically encompass a particular topic or cluster of zettels. I link to the zettels which serve as entry points into a particular cluster. I also include links to other maps of content here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I keep all of my zettels and maps of content at the same level. It&amp;#39;s a personal preference, but I do it so that I don&amp;#39;t force some sort of hierarchy onto my permanent notes, because I want groups and clusters to naturally emerge as I accumulate more and more notes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m trying to navigate my knowledge base, I don&amp;#39;t go through my Zettelkasten document, since it&amp;#39;s got over 2000+ Rem now. I use my &amp;quot;PKM Index&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\ud83c\udf10 &lt;strong&gt;PKM Index -&lt;/strong&gt; This is a document where I link to all the top-level maps of content from my Zettelkasten document. Because I make sure all my maps of content are linked to something else (either the PKM index onother map of content), none of them get lost.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u270d\ufe0f Created Content&lt;/strong&gt; - At the moment, I keep content that I write for work or my own blog in this folder, with each piece of content getting its own document.
