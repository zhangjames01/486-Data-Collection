At best, she planned for this death at the Battle for Lordaeron (which is highly likely, given how ready she was to gas members of the Horde and let Saurfang hold off the Alliance). We see this throughout the Battle for Lordaeron. Any plan she has had in regards to him have been reactionary.\n\nSylvanas did not originally plan to make an alliance with the Zandalari. If this had been the case, this would have been done before the assault on Teldrassil, to ensure no retaliation by sea would be possible. The Zandalari had (unofficially) planned to approach the Horde and were captured by the Alliance.

This is not genius, this is one of the more poorly written aspects of the expansion (Zul \"burning down\" Stormwind with minimal effort and no lasting effect on the city).\n\n\"Infuriating Baine from the start\" is kind of right. Sylvanas has been about weeding out those disloyal to her from the start, hence why she was trying to get Saurfang killed. Realizing she wouldn't be able to give Baine a death in battle that she could use as a symbol, executing him after discrediting him to the rest of the Horde leadership to inspire loyalty in them is her only choice. Again, an act of desperation.\n\nThere was no \"end game\" for Sylvanas, until recently, that was not her stated goal at the start: have Kalimdor be a single faction continent. Based on the War Campaign, War Table Missions, and the Battle for Darkshore, this originally stated goal has been an overwhelming failure and is unlikely to succeed. Her new end game is clearly derived entirely from the dagger formerly known as Xal'atath, which (as of the events of 8.2) has only come into her possession within the past 2-4 weeks.\n\nBased on the events surrounding Crucible, we have no idea if what is currently happening is Sylvanas or N'Zoth's plan. The debate around \"was the Scourge's resistance to Old God taint because of the Lich King's influence or are Undead naturally resistance to it\" has been strong, and without it being resolved in lore, it is still very possible that Sylvanas has become a pawn. I think it's also possible that she understands what Xal'atath is and tried to use it to her advantage at the start of 8.2... but that would imply she knew Nazjatar would \"rise.\" The only way this is possible is if she can hear N'Zoth, but resist him, otherwise she's just a pawn. This is the big mystery of the expansion, at the moment.\n\nRegardless, Sylvanas is not a genius. She has become desperate and, up until Nazjatar, her actions have been chaotic and reactionary. Her original plan failed and she has had one or two lucky moments since. \n\n---\n\nAs for your predictions:\n\nA bargain will be struck, but between the new Horde leadership and the Alliance after Sylvanas is no longer Warchief (absolutely no chance she is still Warchief at the end of this expansion).\n\nIf Sylvanas is a pawn, we may see her as a boss on the way to an end fight with N'Zoth. Nathanos is an equal possibility for a boss, for the same reason. If she is not a pawn, she will likely be the link to the next expansion.\n\nHow Warchief is decided is up in the air. I've heard the \"War Council solution\" rumors, which I think is the best route, or Saurfang / Baine will step up and become Warchief. I'm not sure what you mean by \"done democratically this time.\" With Sylvanas leaving her position unwillingly (no chance of her peacefully stepping down at this point), she wouldn't be able to appoint a successor; the next Warchief will be selected in a style not seen before in the new Horde.\n\nIf we don't face N'Zoth, who or what are you suggesting is the end of this expansion? N'Zoth was put forth as the main villain of the expansion in 8.1.5, and there were hints to him starting at BfA launch. 8.2 ends in N'Zoth being set free. If it isn't N'Zoth, it would be a character linked to N'Zoth (similar to the Argus World Soul and Sargeras). \n\nI don't think Blizzard would do that for a second expansion in a row, and we've faced Old Gods before, so they're in the power range of \"the Champions of Azeroth.\" The only possible character(s) that could be an end boss, giving N'Zoth enough time to create another expansion level crisis, is Sylvanas / Nathanos... so one of your predictions has to be wrong.\n\nAzerite gear linked to the Heart of Azeroth won't make it into next expansion. Azerite as a resource still has a chance of surviving into the next expansion. It's very possible we will save Azeroth, healing her wounds, and making it so no new Azerite is produced (or her dying and there being no new Azerite that way), but a total abandonment of Azerite related tech seems extreme.\n\nThe Heart of Azeroth needs to lose it's power, not the Azerite.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** Your theory does not match the writing of this expansion.
