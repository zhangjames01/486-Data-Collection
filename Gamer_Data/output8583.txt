This crawler then sends an email to the client informing them of the domains and asking if they would like us to take action on them. Here's the key part: LG didn't just automatically submit a takedown request for this domain. Comcast was notified of this domain name, and asked that LG take it down. Uh-oh.\n\nMost likely, takedown was approved for this domain before any content was actually uploaded to the site. But that doesn't really make a difference; this is still fair use. But it does explain that this is likely due to incompetence and ignorance of the law rather than outright malevolence. We were frequently asked to do takedown on charity sites that mentioned they had been sponsored by our clients (which they had been) just because they used Comcast's logo on the charity site.

So I wouldn't rule out mustache-twirling villainy. \n\nBut the best part? In the rare instances in which an analyst would dispute a takedown request by informing the management that the content in question fell under the umbrella of fair use, they would be told to proceed anyway. It didn't matter in the slightest how shitty Comcast's case for takedown was, the client's wishes always took precedent. I personally advocated tenaciously against several takedowns of content similar to this domain, using the logic that attempting to take down the domain name would lead to a massive blowback against Comcast and LG if the person who received the notice posted it online.

They aren't legally binding, they aren't real cease and desist orders, they're basically nothing but a threat. But they don't even result in domains getting taken down because there's already a process for disputing a trademark in a domain name, it's called a UDRP dispute. This isn't a UDRP, and registrars and site owners know that, and they all tell LG (and rightly so) \"UDRP or GTFO\". But that requires a legal team to draft, and that's expensive, so let's just lie to our clients and pretend that these \"takedowns\" actually do something. \"Best-effort\", right? \n\nAnd the REALLY tragic thing? The analyst who submitted this is almost certainly getting thrown to the wolves, just for following orders. I watched it happen several times, an analyst would be crucified for doing exactly what management told them to do! Most of the analysts there wouldn't even be able to define fair use, much less catch something like this. You can't expect a SOC workforce that is almost exclusively part-timers making $18/hr (in the DC area, lel) to know these kinds of things, you have to have faith that the client knows the law and knows how things are likely to shake out.

That's one of the rare instances in which doing something to protect people and a company's brand are the same thing. But just to give you a dipstick as to the level of competence LookingGlass can bring to the table, LookingGlass, an anti-phishing company, was itself phished earlier this year.

Yes, obviously, scientific theories are always open for critique and potential repudiation, that is what makes them scientific theories as opposed to religious doctrine. Science often advances by discovering a new paradigm that provides a better explanation and is supported by more evidence than the current theory. You can see stuff like this happening in relatively recent history with things like universal expansion appearing to be more true than universal contraction (big crunch), or going back a little further to the \"land bridge\" theory being replaced by continental drift and plate tectonics. \n\nI don't think we as a society have anything resembling a problem of blindly accepting things that scientists say. In fact, I'd say that we have kind of the opposite problem; it feels like most things of import that 'science' claims are debated on the national stage. However, and this is what Tyson and Nye are actually talking about, the counter-arguments to these theories are not scientific in origin and will not be discarded or adjusted in light of evidence that supports the current theory. They are arguments that are created with an agenda in mind, an agenda that ignores all evidence that does not support its conclusion, which is the fucking complete opposite of the scientific method. Claims like \"human activity is contributing to climate change\" or \"having an abortion does not increase your odds of breast cancer\" or \"the earth is not 6,000 years old\" are not met by people acting in good faith who are seeking to discover a theory that better explains our reality, they are met with people who want those statements to not be true for reasons that have **nothing to do with science.**\n\nWhat people like Tyson and Nye are trying to accomplish is to inform people that the evidence supporting these theories does not go away if yelled at loudly enough. You can charge Galileo with heresy all you want; the Earth will still continue to revolve around the sun and not the other way around. They're saying \"based upon the existing evidence and review of current theories, the scientific community has widely accepted the theory of special relatively, but this theory could of course be updated or replaced with a better, more accurate theory in the future, and the scientific veracity of special relativity will remain unchanged by religious pressure or attacks upon the character of individual scientists within the field.\" But it's pretty fucking hard to soundbyte something like that! Even if you somehow did mange to condense it into a form that the average person can internalize and remember, it would do nothing to stem the barrage of utter bullshit flung at it by people who are \"just asking questions.\" \n\nFrankly I find the notion of \"well you just can't TRUST what scientists tell you, man!\" to be pretty fucking obnoxious. Which is tragic, because good-faith efforts by scientists to explain that their position could be changed in the future with new evidence and is not considered to be one-hundred percent true, full-stop, no questions, are seen as weakening their position and inviting them to be made to debate people who vehemently believe the earth is 6,000 years old on national fucking television, as though there were any legitimate debate about that within the scientific community. It legitimizes the absolutely un-scientific and almost certainly completely wrong viewpoint by making it seem like it represents an honest inquiry into the scientific process. \"Because God said so,\" is not scientific evidence, but it's made to appear that way by people who are \"just asking questions!\" because both of these men are in equal-sized boxes on CNN. The earth may not be exactly as old as mainstream science claims it to be; we could find things in the future that nudge the date of Earth's creation in the timeline, but it is absolutely not 6,000 goddamned years old, you ignorant cunts.\n\nWe don't see this kind of shit in other fields. \n\n* \"Sure, *mainstream* electrical engineering says that you should have a ground wire, but that's just a secret plan to siphon our power into a government superweapon!\"   \n\n* \"Computer scientists *claim* that there's only two digits in binary, but there's actually a third integer that's between 0 and 1 but THEY don't want you to know about it!\"  \n\n* \"I mean, if you just blindly believe everything a structural engineer tells you, you won't realize that buildings are actually held up by God's love and support beams are an architectural conspiracy that venerates the devil.\"  \n\nThis is the same sort of logic we would hear about these things if they were discussed in the very unscientific eye of the public. But we don't, because we don't have an agenda to make these things cease being true, because we trust the people whose job it is to know this shit to know it better than we do. This stuff sounds fucking ridiculous, but I can guarantee you that if religious doctrine or petrochemical corporation share prices were threatened by any of these facts, we'd be \"teaching the controversy\" and people would cry about how those mean old architects were suppressing them for \"just asking questions!\"\n\nTyson and Nye are stating, \"we're the scientists, it's our job to know this shit, yes we COULD explain the theory to you from the ground up but most of it would fly over your head, which isn't a slight against you it just means that you haven't made it your job to know this shit like we have so can you please just take our fucking word for it that e=mc^2 and not run a political platform that states e=mchammer you ignorant cunts?\"\n\nThey're not asking for scientific debate regarding the veracity of e=mc^2, they're the scientific equivalent of a canary in a coalmine, and they're tweeting to us that the ignorant cunts are taking over.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of feels like whinging semantics that misses the point of what Tyson and Nye are trying to get across. Yes, obviously, scientific theories are always open for critique and potential repudiation, that is what makes them scientific theories as opposed to religious doctrine. Science often advances by discovering a new paradigm that provides a better explanation and is supported by more evidence than the current theory. You can see stuff like this happening in relatively recent history with things like universal expansion appearing to be more true than universal contraction (big crunch), or going back a little further to the &amp;quot;land bridge&amp;quot; theory being replaced by continental drift and plate tectonics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think we as a society have anything resembling a problem of blindly accepting things that scientists say. In fact, I&amp;#39;d say that we have kind of the opposite problem; it feels like most things of import that &amp;#39;science&amp;#39; claims are debated on the national stage. However, and this is what Tyson and Nye are actually talking about, the counter-arguments to these theories are not scientific in origin and will not be discarded or adjusted in light of evidence that supports the current theory. They are arguments that are created with an agenda in mind, an agenda that ignores all evidence that does not support its conclusion, which is the fucking complete opposite of the scientific method. Claims like &amp;quot;human activity is contributing to climate change&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;having an abortion does not increase your odds of breast cancer&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the earth is not 6,000 years old&amp;quot; are not met by people acting in good faith who are seeking to discover a theory that better explains our reality, they are met with people who want those statements to not be true for reasons that have &lt;strong&gt;nothing to do with science.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What people like Tyson and Nye are trying to accomplish is to inform people that the evidence supporting these theories does not go away if yelled at loudly enough. You can charge Galileo with heresy all you want; the Earth will still continue to revolve around the sun and not the other way around. They&amp;#39;re saying &amp;quot;based upon the existing evidence and review of current theories, the scientific community has widely accepted the theory of special relatively, but this theory could of course be updated or replaced with a better, more accurate theory in the future, and the scientific veracity of special relativity will remain unchanged by religious pressure or attacks upon the character of individual scientists within the field.&amp;quot; But it&amp;#39;s pretty fucking hard to soundbyte something like that! Even if you somehow did mange to condense it into a form that the average person can internalize and remember, it would do nothing to stem the barrage of utter bullshit flung at it by people who are &amp;quot;just asking questions.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly I find the notion of &amp;quot;well you just can&amp;#39;t TRUST what scientists tell you, man!&amp;quot; to be pretty fucking obnoxious. Which is tragic, because good-faith efforts by scientists to explain that their position could be changed in the future with new evidence and is not considered to be one-hundred percent true, full-stop, no questions, are seen as weakening their position and inviting them to be made to debate people who vehemently believe the earth is 6,000 years old on national fucking television, as though there were any legitimate debate about that within the scientific community.
