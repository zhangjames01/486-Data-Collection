The past few weeks have seen the complete and utter destruction of fantasy-land politics. We\u2019re witnessing the end of the age of Brexit.\n\nYou can almost feel it in the air around you. A consensus is forming, not just against the current administration, but the Vote Leave era in its entirety. Polling released by the Tony Blair Institute today found 59 per cent of the public thought Brexit had worsened the UK\u2019s economy, including over a third of Leavers. Even The Telegraph comment pages \u2013 the last holdout of Leaver radicalism \u2013 show evidence of a recalibration. One recent headline read: \u201cProject Fear was right all along.\u201d \n\nOn the face of it, this makes no sense. The Budget wasn\u2019t about Brexit. Politically, it was a decisive turning away from the working-class, state-intervention Toryism which defined the premierships of Theresa May and Boris Johnson.\n\nInstead, Liz Truss retreated back to a semi-literate playground version of Thatcherism. All the talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d and \u201cleft-behind\u201d areas was gone. She rejected the electoral alliance that won it for Leave in 2016 and played so well for Johnson in 2019.\n\nBut when you dig a little deeper, the connections emerge.\n\nTruss was right about one thing. Growth has been sluggish. Tax rises are going to be acutely painful. The question is why. Why was this all happening in the first place? And a big part of the answer lies with Brexit.\n\nSince we left the EU, there has been a sudden and persistent 25 per cent fall in UK imports from the EU relative to the rest of the world. According to the Bank of England, Brexit lowered the level of investment by almost 25 per cent in 2020-21. The Office of Budget Responsibility estimates that Brexit is set to reduce productivity by 4 per cent \u2013 double the effect of Covid.\n\nJohn Springford, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform, has spent his time since Brexit comparing the performance of the British economy to a set of doppelgangers \u2013 a basket of countries whose economic performance closely matched the UK until the 2016 referendum. They provide a realistic assessment of what would be happening in an alternate present \u2013 where we never voted to leave.\n\nThe results are brutal. In the final quarter of 2021, UK GDP, a measure of the size of the country\u2019s economy, is 5.2 per cent lower than it would have been if we had voted Remain. Investment is 13.7 per cent lower and goods trade 13.6 per cent lower.\n\nAs economic researchers Adam Posen and Lucas Rengifo-Keller put it: \u201cBrexit means that the UK has declared a trade war on itself.\u201d It is the reason we have a smaller economy, which therefore needs higher taxes to pay for public services, which then led Truss to her hara-kiri mini-Budget. What we are witnessing is the direct causal result of the suffocating economic effects of Brexit.\n\nAnd what back-up plan do we have in the face of that? What newfound power did Brexit hand us to deal with our grim new circumstances? None whatsoever. Quite the opposite. Brexit was sold as the return of sovereignty \u2013 a brave new age in which the country could do what it likes without meddling from outside. But now that pure sense of sovereignty is revealed for the delusion that it is.\n\nFar from being autonomous, our Government is a hostage of the markets. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s recent statement reversing the previous mini-Budget might as well have been written for him by investors. Ministers are not making their own policy decisions. They\u2019re doing whatever will win back the stability they need to function.\n\nThe reason for that is simple: No country enjoys pure sovereignty, not even China or the US. They are all constrained by forces, events and institutions outside of their borders. They can either engage in that process or they can deny it, but the reality will remain regardless.\n\nThis central fact of political existence is now being realised, after six pointless years of pretending otherwise. And something else is coming back too. We\u2019re witnessing the return of objective reality to political debate. We are being given a hard, painful, heavy dose of it.\n\nTruss\u2019s policies led to soaring interest rates on 30-year bonds. That resulted in increases to people\u2019s mortgage payments. A clear-cut line of causation emerged, from the words spoken at the Commons dispatch box to the lives of those unlucky enough to be governed by them.\n\nAnd as objective reality returns, economic orthodoxy does too. There\u2019s no more nonsense chat about how obstacles make no difference to trade or customs borders can be replaced by imaginary high tech solutions.

The past few weeks have seen the complete and utter destruction of fantasy-land politics. We\u2019re witnessing the end of the age of Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can almost feel it in the air around you. A consensus is forming, not just against the current administration, but the Vote Leave era in its entirety. Polling released by the Tony Blair Institute today found 59 per cent of the public thought Brexit had worsened the UK\u2019s economy, including over a third of Leavers. Even The Telegraph comment pages \u2013 the last holdout of Leaver radicalism \u2013 show evidence of a recalibration. One recent headline read: \u201cProject Fear was right all along.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, this makes no sense. The Budget wasn\u2019t about Brexit. Politically, it was a decisive turning away from the working-class, state-intervention Toryism which defined the premierships of Theresa May and Boris Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, Liz Truss retreated back to a semi-literate playground version of Thatcherism. All the talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d and \u201cleft-behind\u201d areas was gone. She rejected the electoral alliance that won it for Leave in 2016 and played so well for Johnson in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you dig a little deeper, the connections emerge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truss was right about one thing. Growth has been sluggish. Tax rises are going to be acutely painful. The question is why. Why was this all happening in the first place? And a big part of the answer lies with Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since we left the EU, there has been a sudden and persistent 25 per cent fall in UK imports from the EU relative to the rest of the world. According to the Bank of England, Brexit lowered the level of investment by almost 25 per cent in 2020-21. The Office of Budget Responsibility estimates that Brexit is set to reduce productivity by 4 per cent \u2013 double the effect of Covid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John Springford, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform, has spent his time since Brexit comparing the performance of the British economy to a set of doppelgangers \u2013 a basket of countries whose economic performance closely matched the UK until the 2016 referendum. They provide a realistic assessment of what would be happening in an alternate present \u2013 where we never voted to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The results are brutal. In the final quarter of 2021, UK GDP, a measure of the size of the country\u2019s economy, is 5.2 per cent lower than it would have been if we had voted Remain. Investment is 13.7 per cent lower and goods trade 13.6 per cent lower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As economic researchers Adam Posen and Lucas Rengifo-Keller put it: \u201cBrexit means that the UK has declared a trade war on itself.\u201d It is the reason we have a smaller economy, which therefore needs higher taxes to pay for public services, which then led Truss to her hara-kiri mini-Budget. What we are witnessing is the direct causal result of the suffocating economic effects of Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what back-up plan do we have in the face of that? What newfound power did Brexit hand us to deal with our grim new circumstances? None whatsoever. Quite the opposite. Brexit was sold as the return of sovereignty \u2013 a brave new age in which the country could do what it likes without meddling from outside. But now that pure sense of sovereignty is revealed for the delusion that it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Far from being autonomous, our Government is a hostage of the markets. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s recent statement reversing the previous mini-Budget might as well have been written for him by investors. Ministers are not making their own policy decisions. They\u2019re doing whatever will win back the stability they need to function.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason for that is simple: No country enjoys pure sovereignty, not even China or the US. They are all constrained by forces, events and institutions outside of their borders. They can either engage in that process or they can deny it, but the reality will remain regardless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This central fact of political existence is now being realised, after six pointless years of pretending otherwise. And something else is coming back too. We\u2019re witnessing the return of objective reality to political debate. We are being given a hard, painful, heavy dose of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Truss\u2019s policies led to soaring interest rates on 30-year bonds. That resulted in increases to people\u2019s mortgage payments. A clear-cut line of causation emerged, from the words spoken at the Commons dispatch box to the lives of those unlucky enough to be governed by them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as objective reality returns, economic orthodoxy does too. There\u2019s no more nonsense chat about how obstacles make no difference to trade or customs borders can be replaced by imaginary high tech solutions. There\u2019s no more Alice in Wonderland frivolity in which we pretend that basic elements of economic life do not apply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now we see that they do. If you put up trade obstacles, trade falls. If you restrict the size of your market, investment falls. If you increase spending, cut taxes, freeze out independent assessments and provide no plan for how you\u2019re ultimately going to make it all match up, markets will lose faith in you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re witnessing the terrible, predictable end of the Brexit adventure: from soaring nationalist rhetoric to plummeting national performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is an old story, about the people who come along with fine words and easy answers, promising a utopia on the horizon just so long as you don\u2019t worry yourself too much about the details.
