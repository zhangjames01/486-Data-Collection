At the same time, I&amp;#39;m really tired of people asking if everyone in my town is that intellectually challenged and talk with the same accent.  &lt;em&gt;Some&lt;/em&gt; of them are indeed that dumb, and most of them do have that accent. And yes, people do drive their tractors and farm equipment to school and pop wheelies in the parking lot, but only on &amp;quot;spirit days.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think she&amp;#39;s just up playing the Dumb Blonde thing as an act, because that&amp;#39;s what brings her parts and money.

Serious props for being professional and maturely.\n\nMy ex went to Vietnam for the summer months to do research for her Art History PhD. (Their program was 2/3 of the year in classes/teaching and 1/3 of the year abroad). We skyped pretty regularly in the evenings. I make plans to go visit her for two weeks over the summer. One day after everything is booked she's very quiet and guiltily tells me that she made out with some other guy.  Then goes on to say she spent the night cuddling with him, but they didn't do anything else. I since realized that this was a massive trickle truth. She brought it up (else I would have never known), but still tried to mitigate the fallout? She calls several times over google voice clearly intoxicated and sad/accusatory, and I reassure her as best I can.\n\nI still go over and visit, not knowing where we stand relationship wise. I also fear infidelity has happened more than what she has told me.  She seems friendly but there's no sex while I'm there, since I don't know where we stand I'll admit I didn't initiate much. One day after I arrive she gives me a small allowance and has me explore while she's in yoga. I end up getting scammed by a motorbike driver for ~$35. Later she asks me to pay for a tour with that money and runs out crying when I admit I got scammed and need to get some money from the ATM to cover the tour. She abandoned me in downtown HCMC, calls me to tell me I need to find my way back, collect my things and find a hotel. By the time I navigate back on foot, she's calmed down but we have a huge argument about me not being wordly/seasoned traveler/adaptable in new environments. Basically I go into \"survival mode\" not wanting to get kicked out to fend for myself for the remainder of the trip. \n\nArguments continue over the next days about my personal appearance (wrinkled clothing) and more about being \"helpless\" in this new environment continue. (I later piece together that she's a high-conflict person and I think derives passion and intensity in her relationships from arguments/making up. This is in contrast to my idea of a relationship being a de-stresser, not a source of stress, which is critical to maintaining sanity working on a STEM PhD).\n\nI get a custom tailored suit (which was awesome for the record, except I'm too fat to wear it now), and she does argue on my behalf to the tailors who messed up the sleeves. We have pretty fun time at the beach (Mui Ne), where I'm able to be more independent since the staff spoke Viet, English, and Russian.\n\nWhen I get back home to the US, I do my best to maintain Skype/Gchat as before. She seems to be very distant/fading. I don't hear from her frequently, and when I do it's indifferent/curt and usually critical of something I did. Finally, a week before she's due to come back (a few days before her birthday and a week before mine), she calls, upset and she ends the relationship over gchat, much like what you experienced.\n\nI was pretty devestated, and a smart person would have cut losses and moved on, but I naively tried to win her back. I got her some birthday presents and picked her up from the airport. Because her roommates were gone, she asked me to stay and keep her company. Cue three more months of a pseudo-relationship where I lived mostly at her place, but there were more arguments, only a few sexy times (that ended in tears/disappointment). Eventually she became shifty/protective of her phone and was talking to an ex. She gave me an ultimatum of allowing an open relationship with a DADT policy or ending the relationship. She wouldn't answer when I asked if she already had someone in mind.\n\nI chose to end it there. (Perhaps she wanted me to be the one who ended it?) When I went to collect my things the next day, she wanted to talk I reiterated that monogamy was what I wanted and that a non-communicative open relationship was not something I was interested in pursuing. I channeled calmness and refused to participate in the escalation.\n\nI did met up with her one time about three weeks later, where she indirectly rubbed in my face about all the new ONSs and new people she was having sex with, and the new potential long-term partner she'd met. I didn't let it phase me and left when I realized there was nothing productive to discuss. I think she just wanted a metric to measure her post-breakup success over mine, but I never showed my hand. It took me a while to get back into the dating scene, but I met someone much, much better and more stable, and we've been together for 2 years.\n\n**tl;dr** Basically OP, pack up her things, cut all contact and do your best to move on.
