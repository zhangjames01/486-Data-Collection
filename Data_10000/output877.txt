You&amp;#39;re really helping to change things, even at the risk of disaster. I&amp;#39;m relieved that it went so well, and I&amp;#39;m excited that you were able to handle everything that the kids threw at you. I feel as though I&amp;#39;m all jumbled up, typing this, but I&amp;#39;m just incredibly excited about all of this and what it means not only to the greater trans community, but to you, personally, as well. Thank you so much, and I&amp;#39;m glad you were able to experience such positivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing: watch out for angry parents who don&amp;#39;t understand what the lesson was about and what you were trying to do. Kids and teens, on the whole, are much more open to learning new things than adults, and that&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;ll face the most criticism. However, you seem to have a lot of support from the younger generation, and I have no doubt they&amp;#39;ll support you.
