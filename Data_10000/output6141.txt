First is that it could lead to an over powered character.  I don't think this is a problem in the sense that a DM couldn't figure out a way to handle it so much as a problem between players.  Basically the danger of the OP build getting too many of the cool moments leading to resentment.  \n\nThe next is a pace of play issue.  Take a bladesinger/eldritch knight.  A bladesinger might use their extra attack feature to make a cantrip attack followed by a melee attack while the EK says that they can use a bonus action to make a weapon attack after casting a cantrip.  Does it work that way?  Is there a *problem* if it works that way?  The answer to such questions doesn't matter so much as the fact that there is room to ask such questions in the first place.  Given the wrong sort of personalities, a session could ground to a halt over such a thing.\n\nThe last one is that it is quite a bit easier to break a 5e character than make them OP.  Maybe a player starts as an artificer for three levels and then decides to become a bladesinger at level 4.
