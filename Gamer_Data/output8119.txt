Which characters should I focus on unlocking and using?\n\nIf your focus is finishing the quests and endless mode - then you will gradually and naturally level up around 10-15 characters. Some characters are nukes (e.g. Terra) which is needed for quests where you need to kill the boss quickly whereas some characters pump out abilities very quickly (e.g Ace) which is needed for other quests. Some quests I use four healers because I need to finish the quests with over 90% health. Some quests require physical teams whereas others need magical teams. With all that said, Terra, Alphinaud, and Lilisette are my highest levelled atm. I just finished all the quests last night.\n\nIf your focus is getting chests, then a mixture of hunter and DPS is good.\n\nWith all that said, this definitely isn't a min max game. Put more weight on which characters you love :) Fran is quite weak imo but I love her too much to ignore.\n\n&gt; which characters are bad\n\nI have ignored the FMS characters because they haven't been essential to quests or online mode. That includes Onion Knight, Red XIII, and Chocobo.\n\n&gt; Will this be a problem in the long run, when it comes to getting fast XP or items?\n\nIn my experience, I usually always play Expert. The higher difficulties have not given me more items or XP. It's just for personal preference.\n\n\\&gt; Should I focus on continuing to level characters past 99 or swap them out when they get to 99?\n\nWhoever is useful for the quest/your personal goals, keep them. I had Cid Raines at Lv 99 no stars because he hasn't been that useful to me beyond a few particular quests. I think it would be useful to have one or two characters at beyond Lv 99 for their stats if you wanted to kill bosses/enemies quicker.\n\n&gt; How should I be efficiently leveling everybody up?\n\nIf you have access to the online mode, keep playing until you find a Summonstone with +70% to +90% exp bonus. I wouldn't bother powerlevelling until you find a summonstone like this. After, go to the Jenova stage on the Theatrhythm stage and spam that. I get 5000 exp per song. I usually put the TV on low volume and listen to YouTube on my phone.\n\n&gt; There seems to be a million cards, all of which have different rarities, is it actually feasible to collect everything? Is there a special way to go about doing this?\n\nYes, it's feasible. Some people have done it already! Each card gives stats. More stats for character cards, more damage for summon cards, more exp for enemy cards, etc. You will gain them naturally. Whenever I have quest that doesn't require DPS, I use my Card Hunter team. Rikku/Zidane/Baltier/Cloud. The first three have card skills and my particular Cloud has very high Luck and Strength to get through enemies quickly. You can also go on particular stage with \"Double Physical Damage\" such as the Jenova stage I mentioned above as well as a stage from the FF7 Series stage that I forgot the name of.\n\n&gt; Mostly, I just feel like my time isn't being spent well right now.\n\nEnjoy the music, enjoy the art, enjoy the gameplay.
