I think it seems fair to suggest that treating a disorder that can only perceived by mind with the act of only treating \"neurotransmitter receptors\" through antagonists in the case of psychotic disorders, is a flawed assumption. It's my mind that goes delusional... it is true that dopamine excitation goes much higher as well... but to say that \"X schizophrenic has high dopamine excitation in the same way Y schizophrenic has high dopamine excitation\" and therefore they are the same schizophrenic capable of being treated by the same inhibition of dopamine activity should be flawed *in some degree*, unless both schizophrenics turn out to be the same person... but at the end of the day, I can really only care about my mind, not my brain... so I want my mind working properly in whatever way my brain can make that work... there's less reason for me to think today that medication is what makes that work, and more reason to think of many components of life that contribute to making that work. \n\n\nThe final analogy to try make this point appreciable is:\n\n**\"Say you built a teleporter machine, even something like the Stargate SG-1 tv show's wormhole, but you built it only to focus on transferring configured matter in the form it is configured from one place to another...
