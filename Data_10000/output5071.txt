Then surely there are supervisors and beta testers/QA people that all approved the design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, despite some UX desingers being hired while not having the correct training, there are also many people who actually studied UX and graphic design, who read UX books and follow all sorts of resources such as blogs and portfolios from the industry. Over at &lt;a href=\"/r/leagueoflegends\"&gt;/r/leagueoflegends&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve seen Riot employees post their qualifications as UX professionals and link to many UX blogs and post about UX philosophy etc, and yet the League game and client are FULL of horrible UX design and the source of vast complaints. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8uufk7\"&gt;This is probably one of the latest.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unless reddit are FULL of UX geniuses that are ALWAYS able to come up with greatly improved design, I don&amp;#39;t see how such rookie mistakes are made so frequently.
