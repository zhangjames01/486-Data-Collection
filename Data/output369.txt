I have non-PhDs as well (generally MSc, usually in ID or HCI). \n\nFar and away the PhDs are much, much better versed in study design, just as /u/oddible says. They are generally much more capable in operationalizing abstract problems in concrete, actionable, and measurable terms. They are NOT better at making pretty presentations, wireframes, or deliverables in general. Although some are better than others.\n\n/u/K_E is right on this point: most UX research is not rocket science. But, then again, most UX research is done pretty shoddily and with really lousy rigor. And most consumers of UX research (stakeholders, management, designers, etc.) are really ill-equipped to differentiate good research from bad. So much of UX in general is steeped in hype and pretty diagrams that *look* like they're conveying information when really saying very little with very weak basis.  It is the job of good UX research leadership to educate their clients to be good consumers of research -- to understand its value (in the first place), and to understand what makes for quality research.  We are of course not doing anything as rigorous as publishable science, but we are employing the scientific method, and businesses are making decisions based on our input. \n\nTo that end, PhDs simply have a stronger formal and practical grounding in cutting through hype to answer hard or vague questions well. Is a PhD necessary? Absolutely not. Is it an advantage? In research, I have found that, yes, it is. \n\nAnd, it's definitely not just Google that employs PhDs. My company isn't even in the tech sector and we employ them. It's not been much of an issue for me in finding work prior to this role. Mainly, it can be a challenge to find work of sufficient fit to your training. And, accepting the reality that you will almost certainly NOT be doing the sort of academic research in which you were trained (either in method or subject matter). That is, unless you do in fact work for a Facebook, Google, Microsoft Research or similar.
