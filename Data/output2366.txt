The money you dropped on an STi was going to the better transmission, the center differential, and DCCD. A large part of why the STi died is because that drivetrain doesn&amp;#39;t mate to the FA and Subaru didn&amp;#39;t want to take on the engineering expense of updating it (alongside the godawful fuel mileage hurting their fleet fuel ratings lol).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to make big power, the VB is arguably a better platform. The power overhead and chassis improvements could potentially make for a better track day car too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a crazy person like me that bought an STi to take to rallycrosses and generally hoon around on unpaved surfaces, there&amp;#39;s no contest. The WRX can&amp;#39;t replicate what the STi does best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are probably more of the former than the latter though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re just a normal sane person that wants a fun daily, it&amp;#39;s just preference at that point.
