There was \"mist\", which is the same level of mist you might receive walking near a lawn sprinkler; there was \"spray\", which was the same level of dousing you'd get eating near my buddy Kevin who has terrible table manners and slurps his soup like nobody's business; finally there was \"niagara\" in which water just kind of blurbled out from the bottom of the shower head in the world's least impressive waterfall.\n\nBut I was young and naive, so for over a year I put up with it.  I didn't have it so bad, I rationalized to myself, at least there was a healthy temperature range.  The temperature would go from the freezing ice cold tundra of Hoth in the winter to a pleasant scalding lava bath in summer, which was just perfect.\n\nBut then I was at a bar one talking to my buddy Kevin about showerheads, as manly men are apt to do when drinking and slurping soup.  He told me that I should just change out the head, old grumpy Mr. Curmudgeonson (I don't think I ever actually learned my landlord's name) would never know the difference.  So in our drunken haze, we returned to my apartment and he grabbed the shower head and yanked with all his might.  Unsurprisingly, the shower head was screwed in and doesn't just pop out so Kevin lost his balance and slipped and died in my tub but that didn't dissuade me from being just like a little patient at all and I unscrewed the head.\n\nThen I turned on the water and much to my surprise, the flow from the pipe was absolutely incredible.  A deluge of actually temperature controlled water flowed over Kevin's lifeless corpse.  \"Perfect!\" I exclaimed to nobody in particular, since Kevin was dead.\n\nAs I was in no condition to drive, I sprinted to my nearest hardware store and much to my surprise, it was still open.  One of the many benefits of day drinking, I suppose.  I burst through the door and slapped my old shower head on the counter.\n\n\"I need a new one, one with more power.\"\n\nThe vaguely sinister looking hardware store clerk stroked his mustache and looked down at my over his half-moon spectacles.  \"How much power are we talking here, son?\"\n\n\"Unlimited.

A faint purple glow emanated from what seemed to be its beating heart.  \"If anyone asks, you didn't get this from me.\"\n\nWhen I got back home, I was happy to see that Kevin's dead body had tidied itself up and was curled up in one of the giant empty cardboard boxes I left in my living room because I was always too lazy to go take them out the recycling.  What a considerate guy.\n\nThe instructions were all in some foreign language (Le Grille?  What the hell is that?) so I just threw them in the box with Kevin and set to work screwing this now obviously pulsating and living shower head into the pipe.  I was finally about to have the shower I had always dreamed of.\n\nI turned on the water and what hit me was the most powerful, high pressure, refreshing stream of perfectly hot water humanity has ever seen.  I was immediately transported into a realm of pure bliss, floating amongst the steam in the room.  I was finally experiencing the perfect shower.\n\nBut alas, in my hubris, I did not consider my exit strategy for the perfect shower.  Because, as everyone knows, once you reach that point of shower nirvana you won't ever want to leave the shower.  Usually, with a traditional, non-cursed shower, the temperature will change or the pressure will sputter or some outside entity can affect the steamy heaven and you will come crashing back down to Earth long enough to stop the shower and proceed with your life.  But this shower never had those moments.\n\nThe hours turned to days turned to weeks and still I stood in that shower.  My skin turned to prunes and my stamina was failing me, my legs shaking as I continued to stand there without sustenance (I had plenty of water, though).  My mind was trapped in the sky, all the tethers it had to Earth had long been withered away by the evilly perfect shower.  \n\nAt some point, I died.  I stared at myself from across the vast cosmos and saw myself in the shower still, the lifeless husk of a body teetering on the brink of existence.\n\nI felt for my limbs, but they were no longer there.  I performed the motion of raising my arm, and I watched as the water sprayed off of the invisible fingertips and splashed down onto the universe below me.

There's a strong argument to be made for that cathartic moment when you come home after a long stressful day of work and you open the door to the purest expression of joy and unconditional love known to man bounding towards you.  But after that relatively short release, your dog retires back to whatever it was doing before you came in, which for mine usually just involves returning to his blanket fort or ball pit or tree house or whatever cool hideaway he's concocted for himself that day to go back to his all-important nap.\n\nBut on a walk, you get to experience full forced dog for the entire time.  Once I jingle jangle his leash he'll be too excited to stand still while I try to hook it on to him, his body vibrating, feet tippy tapping, tail a whirling dervish of destruction knocking over and shattering the priceless Ming vase and original (and autographed) Michelangelo sculpture I keep on a table in the mudroom right in range of a dog tail for some unknown reason.\n\nAnd then you open the door and he bolts forwards with the force of a thousand suns and, given his size, the fact that he is restrained on a leash does not dissuade him or slow him in the slightest.  So he'll drag me across the lawn for a minute or so until his training brings him back down from the initial walk euphoria, he'll trot on over and give me a big kiss while I'm on the ground and it's adorable even though his breath is made of sulfur and poison and he'll wait for me to get up and brush off before we are on our way again.\n\nEven though he is a giant floofy slobbery love monster, he can be an intimidating sight.  Smaller dogs, which for him encompasses every other dog in existence, tend to cower as we pass.  He tries to sniff at them but they run away, leaving him self conscious that he can't make friends.  He tries to befriend the woodland creatures, but they want nothing to do with him.  Even humans tend to be cautious around him as he pulls me towards them, tongues hanging out to the side and tail wagging apocalyptically, this time knocking over park benches and trees with his mighty wagger.\n\nAll he wants is new friends and love, and man oh man, when someone gives it to him he is in heaven.  I remember this one kid who embraced him so readily, with so much gusto, that he actually ended up following the kid home just to see how much love (and food) he could get out of him (before eventually returning to me for his second helping of dinner, naturally).\n\nBut as he pulled me, helplessly, towards this kid the kid charged fearlessly towards him and embraced him.  The kid started scratching behind one of his ears in precisely that beautifully perfect spot which causes his rear leg to spasm up in a scratching motion.  Then he took his other hand and placed it on my dog's other head and scratched behind his ear there, too.  This was just too much to handle.  My dog immediately flopped to the ground and began rolling on the ground in ecstasy.  With his free head, he was applying a liberal coating of slobber to this kid's head, enveloping his head like a wet loving helmet.\n\nAfter tussling and wrestling together in the grass for what seemed like hours, the kid announced that he needed to leave.  He got up and my dog looked at him with all three of his heads with this expression of incredible longing.

He looked up with one of his heads at me, the other two still transfixed at the spot that he last saw the kid.  I can never resist those eyes.

There&amp;#39;s a strong argument to be made for that cathartic moment when you come home after a long stressful day of work and you open the door to the purest expression of joy and unconditional love known to man bounding towards you.  But after that relatively short release, your dog retires back to whatever it was doing before you came in, which for mine usually just involves returning to his blanket fort or ball pit or tree house or whatever cool hideaway he&amp;#39;s concocted for himself that day to go back to his all-important nap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on a walk, you get to experience full forced dog for the entire time.  Once I jingle jangle his leash he&amp;#39;ll be too excited to stand still while I try to hook it on to him, his body vibrating, feet tippy tapping, tail a whirling dervish of destruction knocking over and shattering the priceless Ming vase and original (and autographed) Michelangelo sculpture I keep on a table in the mudroom right in range of a dog tail for some unknown reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then you open the door and he bolts forwards with the force of a thousand suns and, given his size, the fact that he is restrained on a leash does not dissuade him or slow him in the slightest.  So he&amp;#39;ll drag me across the lawn for a minute or so until his training brings him back down from the initial walk euphoria, he&amp;#39;ll trot on over and give me a big kiss while I&amp;#39;m on the ground and it&amp;#39;s adorable even though his breath is made of sulfur and poison and he&amp;#39;ll wait for me to get up and brush off before we are on our way again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even though he is a giant floofy slobbery love monster, he can be an intimidating sight.  Smaller dogs, which for him encompasses every other dog in existence, tend to cower as we pass.  He tries to sniff at them but they run away, leaving him self conscious that he can&amp;#39;t make friends.  He tries to befriend the woodland creatures, but they want nothing to do with him.  Even humans tend to be cautious around him as he pulls me towards them, tongues hanging out to the side and tail wagging apocalyptically, this time knocking over park benches and trees with his mighty wagger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All he wants is new friends and love, and man oh man, when someone gives it to him he is in heaven.  I remember this one kid who embraced him so readily, with so much gusto, that he actually ended up following the kid home just to see how much love (and food) he could get out of him (before eventually returning to me for his second helping of dinner, naturally).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as he pulled me, helplessly, towards this kid the kid charged fearlessly towards him and embraced him.  The kid started scratching behind one of his ears in precisely that beautifully perfect spot which causes his rear leg to spasm up in a scratching motion.  Then he took his other hand and placed it on my dog&amp;#39;s other head and scratched behind his ear there, too.  This was just too much to handle.  My dog immediately flopped to the ground and began rolling on the ground in ecstasy.  With his free head, he was applying a liberal coating of slobber to this kid&amp;#39;s head, enveloping his head like a wet loving helmet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After tussling and wrestling together in the grass for what seemed like hours, the kid announced that he needed to leave.  He got up and my dog looked at him with all three of his heads with this expression of incredible longing.  They whined in symphony with each other, a sad and beautiful song as the kid walked over the horizon into the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You want to go, don&amp;#39;t you boy?&amp;quot;  I asked him.  He looked up with one of his heads at me, the other two still transfixed at the spot that he last saw the kid.  I can never resist those eyes.

Our story begins with our handsome protagonist vomiting into a toilet at a house party late one night; I am fairly certain it was night because it was dark and I couldn't see anything.  There's a flash of lightning or something and the door swings open, a man rushes into the bathroom with some urgency.  He sees me laying claim to the toilet and takes the sink for his own stomach cleansing purposes.  After a few minutes of this camaraderie, I take a long hard look at him.\n\n\"Hey, didn't we live together for a year?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah!\"  Replied Kevin excitedly.  I hadn't seen him since we both moved out of the dorms.  I assumed he died, but I never bothered to find out.   We continued bonding into our respective receptacles until I felt empty enough to return to civilization.  I figured that was enough bonding time with a man I shared a bedroom with for two semesters.\n\nBut that was not all the bonding Kevin had in mind for us that night.  An hour or so later he comes charging up to me, furious.  \"Somebody stole my fucking shoes!  My shoes!\"  He yelled, grabbing me by the shoulders and shaking me.  \"I need your help to find them.\"  And with that, he charged out of the house and into the night.\n\nAfter roughly 30 seconds of searching I completed my quest and found his shoes sitting right next to his coat and phone and wallet and two forms of photo ID and a stool sample.  But, as is sometimes the case, turning in a quest is more of a challenge than collecting the magical MacGuffins themselves.  I made my way out onto the porch to chase Kevin into the night.  \n\nA flash of lightning illuminated his footsteps in the snow.  Like a bloodhound, I thrust my nose into the bare footprint and inhaled deeply, marking his scent.  I got down onto all fours and charged through the fresh powder.  A gaggle of drunk girls were stumbling down the sidewalk and I charged through them like an angry four legged bowling ball following the scent of its former roommate, whatever that's like.

Our story begins with our handsome protagonist vomiting into a toilet at a house party late one night; I am fairly certain it was night because it was dark and I couldn&amp;#39;t see anything.  There&amp;#39;s a flash of lightning or something and the door swings open, a man rushes into the bathroom with some urgency.  He sees me laying claim to the toilet and takes the sink for his own stomach cleansing purposes.  After a few minutes of this camaraderie, I take a long hard look at him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, didn&amp;#39;t we live together for a year?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yeah!&amp;quot;  Replied Kevin excitedly.  I hadn&amp;#39;t seen him since we both moved out of the dorms.  I assumed he died, but I never bothered to find out.   We continued bonding into our respective receptacles until I felt empty enough to return to civilization.  I figured that was enough bonding time with a man I shared a bedroom with for two semesters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that was not all the bonding Kevin had in mind for us that night.  An hour or so later he comes charging up to me, furious.  &amp;quot;Somebody stole my fucking shoes!  My shoes!&amp;quot;  He yelled, grabbing me by the shoulders and shaking me.  &amp;quot;I need your help to find them.&amp;quot;  And with that, he charged out of the house and into the night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After roughly 30 seconds of searching I completed my quest and found his shoes sitting right next to his coat and phone and wallet and two forms of photo ID and a stool sample.  But, as is sometimes the case, turning in a quest is more of a challenge than collecting the magical MacGuffins themselves.  I made my way out onto the porch to chase Kevin into the night.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A flash of lightning illuminated his footsteps in the snow.  Like a bloodhound, I thrust my nose into the bare footprint and inhaled deeply, marking his scent.  I got down onto all fours and charged through the fresh powder.  A gaggle of drunk girls were stumbling down the sidewalk and I charged through them like an angry four legged bowling ball following the scent of its former roommate, whatever that&amp;#39;s like.  They went tumbling into the night sky, in their drunken state they were unaffected by gravity and slowly drifted off to become stars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The rain was coming down much harder now and it stung my eyes; acid rain is a genuine environmental concern.

In their culture it is considered almost polite to chew with their mouths open, smacking loudly with every bite and slurping down liquids with some of the most vulgar and unpalatable noises you can even make with your mouth.

I've called him that to his face before and he replied \"Oh, no milk for me thanks, just toast.

When I was having lunch with Kevin one day, he let on to how exhausted he was.

After an exciting afternoon of strutting along the beach, kicking the sandcastles of local dweebs, and drinking heavily I was pretty exhausted and headed back to the hotel room before dinner, leaving Kevin and Kevinette to their own devices.  Apparently, Kevin just wanted something simple and easy for dinner; he suggested a tasteful burger restaurant which was insultingly unacceptable to Kevinette who expected only the finest dining experiences while on vacation.\n\nI awoke in the room with a start to Kevinette pacing and fuming quietly to herself.  Once she saw that I was awake, she became vocal, letting loose years of gold digger rage. \"Kevin never takes care of me, he doesn't care about me at all, why can't I find myself a real man!\"\n\nAnd then she jumped into the bed with me and kissed me.  I was stunned, sitting up in the bed silently, not knowing how to react. She pushed me backwards and began groping me wildly.  Apparently I fit her definition of a real man, which must mean that Kevin was *terrible* in bed. \n\nMy mind was spinning.  Her enthusiasm was unfettered by my complete lack of movement or reaction.  I got the feeling that this was mostly for her own sake.  I closed my eyes as she jostled my shirt off but when I reopened them I saw him.\n\nHis silhouette was framed in the doorway.  Kevinette, in all her greedy lust, didn't notice him behind us.  He lunged forward in a blind rage, throwing Kevinette to the floor and grabbing me by the collar, lifting me into the air effortlessly.  I had never seen Kevin be so assertive before.\n\nOnly when I looked into his eyes, I realized it wasn't Kevin at all.  No, the more I focused on him I realized it was my good friend, the Physical Manifestation of Debt, brought to our plane of existence by the magnitude of debt in Kevin's presence.

The men laughed at him.  One of them gave Kevin a quick kick, not breaking eye contact with Herbert.  Herbert shook his head.  Kevin gave out a slight whimper.  It was time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He opened up his fist to reveal what was in his hand.  An enormous swarm of bees erupted and flew directly at the fighters.  They were quickly enveloped by what seemed to be an endless stream of stinging mayhem.  They collapsed on the floor, trying in vain to swat the insects away from their faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Herbert slowly shuffled over to Kevin and helped him up.  He dusted off Kevin&amp;#39;s shoulders and gave him a gentle grin.  Screams of agony came from the men on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that was it.  There would be no jail, no other punishment for their violent outburst.  Herbert ambled out the door and started making his way slowly down the street.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3thn1q", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/3thn1q/what_job_could_you_never_do_no_matter_how_much/cx6ccku/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3thn1q/what_job_could_you_never_do_no_matter_how_much/", "name": "t1_cx6ccku", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1447978689.0, "created_utc": 1447978689.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3thn1q/what_job_could_you_never_do_no_matter_how_much/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What do YOU think is just so unfair?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 6, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "ferry888", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cvtaboh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "MrTurburdaugh", "num_comments": 4904, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cvt5sww", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_4jr4k", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 1, "body": "Okay, allow me to play Devil's Avocado here for a minute, even if it is unpopular.
