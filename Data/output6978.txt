All I want in Senlin&amp;#39;s story is for Senlin to find Marya and be together with her again!!! - though I am enjoying all the rest of it.&amp;quot;\"&gt;it was the bit at the end when we find out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_5ml42d", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Fantasy/comments/5ml42d/the_arm_of_the_sphinx_oh_how_gripping_it_is/dc4wlex/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5ml42d/the_arm_of_the_sphinx_oh_how_gripping_it_is/", "name": "t1_dc4wlex", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fantasy", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1483832668.0, "created_utc": 1483832668.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5ml42d/the_arm_of_the_sphinx_oh_how_gripping_it_is/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qknd", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The Arm of the Sphinx - oh how gripping it is", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 6, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Fantasy", "link_author": "UrQuanLord", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dc4i4fw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "tomunro", "num_comments": 18, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5ml42d", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_dr9c0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I cried at the ending too - and had to message Josiah about it.
