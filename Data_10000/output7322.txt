I&amp;#39;m supposed to be getting a refund from some of the movers any day now, and my paycheck gets deposited on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So. The website has not announced anything, so I&amp;#39;m almost certain that I&amp;#39;m just getting bad luck. I&amp;#39;m not crazy- the reality is more that I&amp;#39;m just having issues with moving to a new area and the constant Walmart runs has deactivated my card, especially in a new area, but with the stock closing 20% down and trading having to be suspended on it once today, I&amp;#39;m far more concerned about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at the worst case scenario (and yes, I 100% think I&amp;#39;m overreacting here but in the last week it seems like everything has gone bad for me) and what happens if my bank fails? Are the incoming deposits going to be returned? Are they still going to be deposited and moved into whatever new bank account I get?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fully admit I&amp;#39;m under prepared for this. I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting an almost 4k expense to kill whatever savings I had built up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11pukuy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/personalfinance/comments/11pukuy/banking_megathread_fdic_ncua_and_your_cash/jc4e7mx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/11pukuy/banking_megathread_fdic_ncua_and_your_cash/", "name": "t1_jc4e7mx", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678749623.0, "created_utc": 1678749623.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/11pukuy/banking_megathread_fdic_ncua_and_your_cash/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnv4", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Worst tattoo you got while manic?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "bipolar", "link_author": "ShroomieDoomieDoo", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbuuxk1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Ewalk", "num_comments": 215, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11mxns8", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3ws9c", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I got \u201cAsian Writing\u201d.
