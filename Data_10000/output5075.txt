That&amp;#39;s why I am certain that forcing more kids to buy from the black market is a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or how much cheaper vaping non disposables works out&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, you are dead wrong. I vape liquids that I make myself from certified ingredients. I know precisely how much cheaper that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ban them from selling all vapes would mean they&amp;#39;re easier to be caught.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like banning imported cigarettes and cannabis has, right? It patently obviously does NOT work!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;add in a smuggling chain and it&amp;#39;s less so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No. Because once you ban shops from selling them, you give the black market the monopoly and they can charge whatever they want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;harder to hide since someone vaping one would stand out like a sore thumb and parents wouldn&amp;#39;t let their kids vape them, it would become akin to gas sniffing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So explain why people are quite comfortable walking around smoking weed in the streets.
