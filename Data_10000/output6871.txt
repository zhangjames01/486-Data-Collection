Flags are a great way to do that. Flags let people know what you value or align with. That's very helpful when people are looking for a group to join (or a group to avoid). Flags aren't just for movements. They're a method of communication. They're social cues - if I walk into a bar that has Packers flags on the wall, I know not to ask them to turn on the Vikings game, because I know they probably won't take kindly to that request.\n\nIt would be great if everyone treated each other with dignity and respect, but that's not the world we live in - that's an ideal world, not the \"current era\" to which you refer. We live in a world where people are judged, hated, and discriminated against.

Someone wearing a pride flag isn't advertising sex, they're probably just signaling that they're a member or ally of the lgbtq community. Yeah, some people's message is that they're way too into a country, and we consider them tacky.

Can you understand that they might appreciate knowing so they can avoid closet nazis?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;i think it is better to keep your opinions private&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s fine if you want to do that, but surely you understand that others like to make their opinions public? Flags are a great way to do that. Flags let people know what you value or align with. That&amp;#39;s very helpful when people are looking for a group to join (or a group to avoid). Flags aren&amp;#39;t just for movements. They&amp;#39;re a method of communication. They&amp;#39;re social cues - if I walk into a bar that has Packers flags on the wall, I know not to ask them to turn on the Vikings game, because I know they probably won&amp;#39;t take kindly to that request.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be great if everyone treated each other with dignity and respect, but that&amp;#39;s not the world we live in - that&amp;#39;s an ideal world, not the &amp;quot;current era&amp;quot; to which you refer. We live in a world where people are judged, hated, and discriminated against. Flags are a great way to know who will treat you kindly and who will treat you badly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;how does this apply at all to a flag that people fly on their home or wear on their shirt?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just advertising. It&amp;#39;s all kinds of communication. Maybe they like that country, maybe they want to visit, maybe they just think the design is cool. Someone wearing a pride flag isn&amp;#39;t advertising sex, they&amp;#39;re probably just signaling that they&amp;#39;re a member or ally of the lgbtq community. Yeah, some people&amp;#39;s message is that they&amp;#39;re way too into a country, and we consider them tacky. But we consider them tacky because the flag served its purpose: communicating a message about the person wearing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;this is a fine example where a flag can make some sense&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does that mean your view has changed, even a little?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ti2fj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/11ti2fj/cmv_government_flags_have_no_good_purpose_in_the/jclp9od/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11ti2fj/cmv_government_flags_have_no_good_purpose_in_the/", "name": "t1_jclp9od", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "author_flair_text": "41\u2206", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679079930.0, "created_utc": 1679079930.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/11ti2fj/cmv_government_flags_have_no_good_purpose_in_the/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "cmv: government flags have no good purpose in the current era", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "changemyview", "link_author": "IronSmithFE", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jclcfjt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "nofftastic", "num_comments": 93, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jckz4oa", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_ewhp2", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'd rather no one fly a nazi flag; not because I want them to keep it to themselves, but because I don't think anyone should be a nazi.
