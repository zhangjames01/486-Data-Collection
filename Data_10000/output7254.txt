Sarno's later books wander into this territory...\n\nBasically, a lot of LBP is difficult to treat because the spine can be physically damaged, get inflamed for various reasons, have nerves/small muscles pinched/irritated, muscle strains/sprains, etc.  There are so many ways for LBP to occur and many of them are so hard to detect that doctors don't have a good way to identify most causes, let alone offer specific treatments.  For persistent LBP, doctors often go through a list of increasingly invasive treatments sometimes ending in surgery.  However, due to not knowing the cause much of the time, double blind studies of surgery outcomes have shown similar effect to just telling patients to stay active and mobile.\n\nA whole research area developed in the 90's about psychosocial causes for LBP.  The reigning theory was that too much load on the spine (lifting, being overweight, etc.) caused physical damage that built up over time until LBP developed.  Psychosocial research indicated that *some* LBP can be caused by stress and the impact it has on spinal loading/immune-inflammatory responses, etc.  Researchers also targeted the mind's amazing ability to bring about pain on its own.  This psychosomatic pain is thought to either occur when stress triggers an underlying condition (endocrine disorders, autoimmune disorders and other tricky things to diagnose) or (throwing hands up in the air) \"just because\".\n\nTreating psychosomatic pain because a thing.  Actually, it had been a thing for a while but it really grew in prominence around then. Sarno had been investigating psychosomatic backache since the '70s and was seeing promising results. There's definitely something to be said for stress reduction!  However, reducing stress takes time and a lot of LBP goes away/reduces if you just give it time.  So, it was tricky to determine if the treatment was different from placebo. Sarno's research indicated that his techniques were superior to other *psychological* interventions so, it has that going for it.\n\nUnfortunately, LBP has such a well established causal link to heavy physical work that researchers caution against just doing mind-body stress-reduction techniques (Sarno-style or otherwise) and still doing the heavy physical labor.  In 2000 the National Academies of Science released a report showing that Biomechanics (forces on the spine), Psychosocial (stresses) and Individual (body dimensions, personality, etc.) factors all combine to impact LBP risk and the combination of these factors is incredibly powerful. Sarno's techniques only focus on one of the factors.  While they have some power over that factor, they're not a cure-all.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, haven&amp;#39;t heard that name in a while!  I&amp;#39;ve seen Sarno&amp;#39;s approach applied to low back pain (LBP) primarily but he looked at it for pain in other areas as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tl;dr is that he has some decent techniques for treating &lt;em&gt;psychosomatic&lt;/em&gt; LBP but there&amp;#39;s a tendency to kinda default to &amp;quot;all LBP is psychosomatic&amp;quot; by Sarno practitioners that can end up promising snake-oil style miracle cures that go beyond psychosomatic LBP and, heck, beyond LBP in general. Sarno&amp;#39;s later books wander into this territory...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, a lot of LBP is difficult to treat because the spine can be physically damaged, get inflamed for various reasons, have nerves/small muscles pinched/irritated, muscle strains/sprains, etc.  There are so many ways for LBP to occur and many of them are so hard to detect that doctors don&amp;#39;t have a good way to identify most causes, let alone offer specific treatments.  For persistent LBP, doctors often go through a list of increasingly invasive treatments sometimes ending in surgery.  However, due to not knowing the cause much of the time, double blind studies of surgery outcomes have shown similar effect to just telling patients to stay active and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A whole research area developed in the 90&amp;#39;s about psychosocial causes for LBP.  The reigning theory was that too much load on the spine (lifting, being overweight, etc.) caused physical damage that built up over time until LBP developed.  Psychosocial research indicated that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; LBP can be caused by stress and the impact it has on spinal loading/immune-inflammatory responses, etc.  Researchers also targeted the mind&amp;#39;s amazing ability to bring about pain on its own.  This psychosomatic pain is thought to either occur when stress triggers an underlying condition (endocrine disorders, autoimmune disorders and other tricky things to diagnose) or (throwing hands up in the air) &amp;quot;just because&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treating psychosomatic pain because a thing.  Actually, it had been a thing for a while but it really grew in prominence around then. Sarno had been investigating psychosomatic backache since the &amp;#39;70s and was seeing promising results. There&amp;#39;s definitely something to be said for stress reduction!  However, reducing stress takes time and a lot of LBP goes away/reduces if you just give it time.  So, it was tricky to determine if the treatment was different from placebo. Sarno&amp;#39;s research indicated that his techniques were superior to other &lt;em&gt;psychological&lt;/em&gt; interventions so, it has that going for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, LBP has such a well established causal link to heavy physical work that researchers caution against just doing mind-body stress-reduction techniques (Sarno-style or otherwise) and still doing the heavy physical labor.  In 2000 the National Academies of Science released a report showing that Biomechanics (forces on the spine), Psychosocial (stresses) and Individual (body dimensions, personality, etc.) factors all combine to impact LBP risk and the combination of these factors is incredibly powerful. Sarno&amp;#39;s techniques only focus on one of the factors.  While they have some power over that factor, they&amp;#39;re not a cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_sy77rf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/RSI/comments/sy77rf/thoughts_on_dr_sarno/hxweih3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RSI/comments/sy77rf/thoughts_on_dr_sarno/", "name": "t1_hxweih3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RSI", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1645488217.0, "created_utc": 1645488217.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RSI/comments/sy77rf/thoughts_on_dr_sarno/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "TIL in 1947 Bing Crosby had to record a new version of \"(I'm Dreaming of a) White Christmas\" because the original master version of 1942 wore out, due to being constantly repressed to meet demand.
