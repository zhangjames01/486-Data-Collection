New Hampshire was decided in 1942, in that case Chaplinsky called a New Hampshire town Marshal \"a God-damned racketeer\" and \"a damned fascist\". and SCOTUS found that those words constituted fighting words, which forms one of the exceptions to the first amendment's freedom of speech (there are others). Since 1942, SCOTUS has not found fighting words again. see, Street v. New York (1969); R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992).\n\nWhile your quotation of the decision in Chaplinsky is correct in defining how the Court saw fighting words in 1942, the fighting words doctrine/exception to the first amendment is all but powerless today. I would argue that that is probably a good thing as limitations on free speech are generally bad (think: limitations on reddit).\n\nWhen you apply the SCOTUS decision to the Zimmerman facts, your use of the term 'broad' is an understatement.

So, for all intents and purposes, lets consider the act of walking to be speech. Next, we would use the words of SCOTUS to determine if that speech which we've already found is something which can automatically incite an immediate breach of the peace [emphasis is mine]. First, the key words we must look to are automatic and immediate. In their decision on Chaplinsky, SCOTUS determined that when someone slanders another by using the exact terms \"a God-damned racketeer\" and \"a damned fascist\", such words by their very utterance will automatically and immediately cause the slandered person to either become injured or to fly into a rage and begin to fight. Thus, the test is two part: 1) they have to be words that by their very utterance; 2) will inflict injury or will tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. Now, lets apply this to the general act of following another individual (here via your analysis, the act of following will constitute 'the very utterance' performance of which will tend to lead to injury and incitement). In other words, can the general act of following another human, cause the followee, when he.she discovers they are being followed to automatically and immediately become injured or incite such passion in that person so that he/she will likely fight the follower? No. For fighting words to work as SCOTUS defined them in Chaplinsky, the mere utterance of these 'fighting words' will lead to injury or incitement almost all the time (tend). So much so, if the cause and effect of these words was less probable and less predictable (like in today's world), the Court would not have been able to overcome the Strict Scrutiny threshold it needed to ban this type of speech. Furthermore, today, Im sure you would have no problem calling someone a god damned racketeer and a god damned fascist.
