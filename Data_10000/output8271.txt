No, I never forget it. You know what sucks more than being a fat girl? Being a weird fat girl.

I've never really experienced a social life. Because of this, I'm really socially awkward. I don't know what it's like to have someone who I can depend on.

No, that's not self-pity. That's how things have always worked for me. Yes, I'm still scarred from my adolescence. You don't lose those scars.\n\nI live behind the internet, I guess. I don't give out my picture often. Because of this, people can't simply dismiss me because I'm fat. If they dislike me, it's because I'm annoying or harsh or critical or whatever reason. Not because I'm fat. And I like that. I want someone to fucking judge me on my personality.
