It's definitely not RAW but perhaps something to get you started:\n\n\n* Each potion has 3 ingredients in my setting. \n\n* Players can find recipe books for potions:\n    * The recipes indicate the ingredients, possible substitutes, the quantities and the method needed to produce specific potions\n    * Each correct ingredient increases the chance of producing the intended potion. With every substitute, it increases the chance for failure. I largely rely on d100s for this. One replaced ingredient puts a 33% chance of failure, 2 replaced ingredients bring it up to 66%. There is usually one core ingredient that cannot be replaced.\n    * Players can pay teachers, alchemists or others to teach them the skills to complete specific potions. The rarer the potion, the rarer the teacher/more expensive it is to learn.\n\n\n* When players with to experiment blindly:\n   * Make a nature, arcana or whatever applicable check. Add proficiency or give advantage if they have an alchemy / potions kit.\n   * I set an experimentation DC depending on the level of the potion: common dc 12, uncommon dc 16, rare dc 20, very rare dc 24. \n   * Experimenting once with an ingredient does not consume it and leaves enough for them to try and manufacture the potion. There is enough in an ingredient to experiment once and make the potion or experiment 3 times before it is consumed. \n   * If they fail, I tell them \"you see no obvious reaction that would indicate this would be conducive to further solo research\"\n   * If they fail by 5, there is an adverse reaction.

Sure, you just haven't figured out how to use those wings yet. You want to be a turtle? Awesome, swimming is super hard with a shell on your back, a few more attempts and you're sure you'll have it sorted out.\" type of approach.\n\nIt's worth nothing that **some** creatures that have alternate speeds (swim, flying) can have somewhat lower stats when compared to their landlocked counterparts specifically because they can fly, either reflected in their hit points or in the damage they can put out, so you can always point that out to your players.\n\nBalancing around druids can be tricky - their wildshapes act as a damage sponge. It comes with trial and error. If you're unsure, start on the lower side of things and stick with what you have. If you find they're munching through enemies too quickly, you can always add in reinforcements to come and help take down that big bear/dire wolf/what have you. Wildshape starts off strong and eventually averages out. Moon druids can specifically turn into Elementals later which brings in even more fun! \n\nIt's alright for the druid to feel like a badass too, and it's a balancing act to make sure all the players feel useful during combat. If the enemies are clever, perhaps they trap the wildshaping druid. Maybe they ignore the obvious huge creature and go for its smaller friends to split its attention. I usually will have 2 creatures on the druid and if the druid stays wildshaped for 2 rounds before I bring them out of it, then I feel like they've gotten their worth out of it. \n\nWhile wildshaped, this is often relevant:\n\n*&gt;\"You can\u2019t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn\u2019t break your concentration on a spell you\u2019ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you\u2019ve already cast.\"*\n\nIf they're the only healer of the party, this can force them out of the shape early to address other issues. Put out a lot of fires and let them decide how to deal with it.\n\nI've seen a follow-up question before: can my casters Moonbeam a druid to force it out of Wildshape? RAW, no, it does not trigger the wildshaped druid to revert back to its original form as a druid is not tagged with the Shapechanger feature, but as always, it's up to you to decide for your table.\n\nHopefully this is useful!

Sure, you just haven&amp;#39;t figured out how to use those wings yet. You want to be a turtle? Awesome, swimming is super hard with a shell on your back, a few more attempts and you&amp;#39;re sure you&amp;#39;ll have it sorted out.&amp;quot; type of approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth nothing that &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; creatures that have alternate speeds (swim, flying) can have somewhat lower stats when compared to their landlocked counterparts specifically because they can fly, either reflected in their hit points or in the damage they can put out, so you can always point that out to your players.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Balancing around druids can be tricky - their wildshapes act as a damage sponge. It comes with trial and error. If you&amp;#39;re unsure, start on the lower side of things and stick with what you have. If you find they&amp;#39;re munching through enemies too quickly, you can always add in reinforcements to come and help take down that big bear/dire wolf/what have you. Wildshape starts off strong and eventually averages out. Moon druids can specifically turn into Elementals later which brings in even more fun! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s alright for the druid to feel like a badass too, and it&amp;#39;s a balancing act to make sure all the players feel useful during combat. If the enemies are clever, perhaps they trap the wildshaping druid. Maybe they ignore the obvious huge creature and go for its smaller friends to split its attention. I usually will have 2 creatures on the druid and if the druid stays wildshaped for 2 rounds before I bring them out of it, then I feel like they&amp;#39;ve gotten their worth out of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While wildshaped, this is often relevant:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;You can\u2019t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn\u2019t break your concentration on a spell you\u2019ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you\u2019ve already cast.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;re the only healer of the party, this can force them out of the shape early to address other issues. Put out a lot of fires and let them decide how to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen a follow-up question before: can my casters Moonbeam a druid to force it out of Wildshape? RAW, no, it does not trigger the wildshaped druid to revert back to its original form as a druid is not tagged with the Shapechanger feature, but as always, it&amp;#39;s up to you to decide for your table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this is useful!
