The Persian word &amp;quot;azad&amp;quot; actually originally meant &amp;quot;member of the family&amp;quot;. It was common in the Middle East for house servants to be treated well, to the point where they were considered family members. In many cases they were no longer considered slaves but they would marry into the family and also receive inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marandi uses this as an example of &amp;quot;colonization&amp;quot; of the mind, but to some extent cultural assimilation is normal; it happens within Iran as well. Iran is definitely a cultural empire, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Iranians aren&amp;#39;t as brutal and destructive about it as, say, the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Within the context of their discussion, Russia&amp;#39;s entire national identity dating back a thousand years rests on this concept that they are white Christian saviors fighting against evil Asian/Muslim invasion and corruption. So if we are going to talk about Orientalism and imperialism, it&amp;#39;s important to note that Russia is one of the biggest culprits ever, and it continues even today worse than what you may find in America or Europe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11usn9j", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ProIran/comments/11usn9j/prof_marandi_alizadeh_discuss_cultural/jcslj08/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ProIran/comments/11usn9j/prof_marandi_alizadeh_discuss_cultural/", "name": "t1_jcslj08", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ProIran", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679206756.0, "created_utc": 1679206756.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://v.redd.it/0am6knmlvioa1"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_ujz7x", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "who is your favorite middle east country", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": -1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskCentralAsia", "link_author": "Beautiful_Thing_231", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jcs8q0l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "marmulak", "num_comments": 33, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jcs86fj", "score": -1, "author_fullname": "t2_4auhl", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Iran is not occupied; its government was made precisely by Iranians themselves, and they are the ones continuing to run it.
