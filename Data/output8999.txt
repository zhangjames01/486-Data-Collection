Though we are taught more than our Grandparents in school, I think the quality of school was better back then.  Now, there is no incentive to teach a strong work ethic.  Math teachers no longer emphasize times tables and English/history teachers no longer stress spelling because &amp;quot;computers do that for you&amp;quot; (or at least this was my experience through out).  Work ethic and a desire to learn are the 2 most important things schools give, and they are failing now.  The common consensus is that school sucks and learning sucks.  I hate that was my attitude for so long, because though I have a good education, I could know and be interested in so much more.&lt;br/&gt;\nName one thing the Dept of Education as done to make our school systems better.

And though I disagree with with Christianity, Mormons, and Islam when it comes to Gay Marriage, I can not force them to marry Gays in their church. But there may be churches that decide to do it, and I support that.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow, someone did bring up an interesting point that Marriage pre-dates religion... I would have to look into that, because if that is the case, then yeah, Gay  Marriage all the way.  My assumption was that Marriage was a religious defined term.&lt;br/&gt;\nEDIT: I just realized that in my solution, Atheists would also never get married, but instead have a legal civil union.  As an Atheist, I think I would be cool with that so long as &amp;quot;Marriage&amp;quot; as no legal benefits over &amp;quot;Civil Union&amp;quot;.  Of course the awkward part is I am married, and I have actually wondered in the time since I have become an atheist (after I was married) if the religious part of my marriage should be annulled.
