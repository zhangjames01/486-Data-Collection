It was reported that already in the first days the Czechs managed to shoot down two Soviet helicopters.  I personally witnessed the events, which unfolded near the building of the Historical Museum in Prague. Automatic fire was opened at our soldiers from the attic of the building.  The exchange of fire with the people in the attic lasted about two hours. It was possible to suppress the fire only with the help of a tank gun.  Our soldiers daily found new caches of weapons in the premises of various organizations, enterprises and institutions.  When asked where these weapons came from and what for, the Czechs usually answered that they were the weapons of the people's militia.  However, it was hard to believe this, given the set that was stored in these depots. These were not only pistols and assault rifles, but also anti-tank grenades, heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, boxes of explosive shells, plastic explosives, etc.   Of course, all this was of no use to a public order organization, but it would be just right for terrorist and subversive structures. In addition, all of this was stored in well camouflaged places, in hidden compartments and even in underground warehouses.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Czech radio worked on the patriotic feelings of Czech citizens.  They broadcast tall tales about Soviet soldiers shooting women and children and destroying houses. Our soldiers were presented as primitive, uncultured people. It was said that Soviet soldiers were unthinking beings, and that officers were soulless, stupid, and barbaric.  It was said that the Soviet Army was starving, so people had to hide dogs and cats.  Young people were called for armed resistance.  Instructions were broadcast on the radio to destroy and deface road signs of traffic directions. We learned about the implementation of this last demand in the morning of August 21. There were practically no signs on the entrance to Prague, and those that had survived had been turned in the opposite direction.  In Prague itself, street names and house numbers were missing in a number of places and had been torn down and beaten.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*On the morning of August 22, we did not recognize the city.  Prague was literally covered with stickers, posters and slogans with anti-Soviet content in Czech and Russian: \"Democracy without USSR and Communists\", \"Occupiers, go home\", \"Invaders out of Prague\", \"USA-Vietnam, USSR-Czechoslovakia\", \"Russians, you can rape us, but you cannot make us give birth\", \"Death to Occupiers\", \"1938 = 1968\".  Among them were many clearly offensive: \"Soviet soldiers, vodka in Moscow - go there,\" \"Russian drunks, go to your bears in Siberia\".  Many inscriptions were devoted to Leonid Brezhnev personally, with most often some obscene expressions next to his surname.   There were also many anti-communist slogans: \"A good communist is a dead communist,\" \"Beat the communists,\" etc. On one of the walls of a building in the center of Prague we saw a picture on which there was a bear (with \"USSR\" on it) and a hedgehog (with \"Czechoslovakia\" on it) and over it the words: \"The bear will never be able to eat the hedgehog\".  Already on the second day this composition was supplemented with the inscription (probably made by Soviet soldiers): \"But what if you shave it?\"*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*The Czechs were astonished at the conviction of our soldiers in presenting the Soviet position.  More than once I heard Czechs say that regular soldiers were not privates of the Soviet Army, but disguised KGB officers, political instructors, and commissars. Most Czechs were not in contact with us because they liked us (rather the opposite), but because they were curious: \"What will the Russian Ivan say?\" However, many of the Czechs were afraid of their own. Thus we were well aware of the fact that in Prague on September 3 several girls had their hair cut as punishment for talking to Soviet tankers.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- From ''Memories of the Czechoslovak events of 1968 through the eyes of a Soviet Army sergeant and lawyer Yuri Sinelshchikov''", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the first hours of our troops&amp;#39; entry, the Czechs began to show active disobedience.

Many inscriptions were devoted to Leonid Brezhnev personally, with most often some obscene expressions next to his surname.   There were also many anti-communist slogans: &amp;quot;A good communist is a dead communist,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Beat the communists,&amp;quot; etc. On one of the walls of a building in the center of Prague we saw a picture on which there was a bear (with &amp;quot;USSR&amp;quot; on it) and a hedgehog (with &amp;quot;Czechoslovakia&amp;quot; on it) and over it the words: &amp;quot;The bear will never be able to eat the hedgehog&amp;quot;.  Already on the second day this composition was supplemented with the inscription (probably made by Soviet soldiers): &amp;quot;But what if you shave it?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Czechs were astonished at the conviction of our soldiers in presenting the Soviet position.  More than once I heard Czechs say that regular soldiers were not privates of the Soviet Army, but disguised KGB officers, political instructors, and commissars. Most Czechs were not in contact with us because they liked us (rather the opposite), but because they were curious: &amp;quot;What will the Russian Ivan say?&amp;quot; However, many of the Czechs were afraid of their own. Thus we were well aware of the fact that in Prague on September 3 several girls had their hair cut as punishment for talking to Soviet tankers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;From &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Memories of the Czechoslovak events of 1968 through the eyes of a Soviet Army sergeant and lawyer Yuri Sinelshchikov&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_p9ffus", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Politsturm/comments/p9ffus/yesterday_was_the_53rd_anniversary_of_the_end_of/h9xvehb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Politsturm/comments/p9ffus/yesterday_was_the_53rd_anniversary_of_the_end_of/", "name": "t1_h9xvehb", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Politsturm", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1629658268.0, "created_utc": 1629658268.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/jvfa6fgaqxi71.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uc81", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "'revolutionaries who talk a great deal about non-existent parliaments and too little about existing city councils'", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "communism101", "link_author": "The_Space_Comrade", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h8f8jl6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "-saats", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_h8f1f2y", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_6shy5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not the article itself but the *attitude*.

So not only he knew very well what he was doing, but he also 'accidentally got it right'.

He always stayed true to class analysis and never stopped fighting for peoples liberation.

Krupskaya\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 1866 the first revolutionary-terrorist act in Russian history is made when a socialist-revolutionary tries but fails to assassinate Emperor Alexander II. The ''Liberator'' of serfs would face 6 assassination attempts between 1866-1880. During this time it was bureaucrat hunting season with many officers, aristocrats, government employees being assassinated left and right by 'Narodnik' organisations, quickly followed by waves of executions and repression against the revolutionaries by the state. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn 1879, from the ashes of ''Land and Will'' and the Narodnik terrorist organisation ''Freedom or Death'', revolutionary-terrorist organisation ''People's Will'' is formed with the goal of using radical methods to force the Russian state to adopt democratic reforms and to push society towards socialism and revolution. Bomb explosions, assassinations, bank robberies, everything was on the table.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOn 1st March 1881, ''The Liberator'' Alexander II (along with 3 other people, including a 14 year old boy) is assassinated by ''People's Will'' with a bomb explosion. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nFrom 1881 until 1883 the Tsarist state organized mass repressions against revolutionaries -  hanging, executing, and exiling thousands of people. Regardless of these events, a weakened ''People's Will'' continued to cause trouble and assassinate government figures all over Russia. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn 1887, symbolically also on 1st March, an assassination attempt is made on Tsar Alexander III by the unaffiliated organisation ''Terrorist Fraction of People's Will''. The attempt failed and the 15 plotters were arrested, half of them hanged, half exiled to Siberia. Among the hanged revolutionaries was Alexander Ulyanov, Lenin's brother and one of the leaders of the organisation. This left a huge mark on 17 year old Lenin. ''What is to be done?'' was Alexander's favorite book and although Lenin has already read it, he began a more thorough study of the work. He used to say \u201cThis thing charges you (like a battery) for your entire life''\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Thanks to Chernyshevsky's articles I became interested in economic questions, especially in how the Russian village lived... Before I became acquainted with the works of Marx, Engels and Plekhanov, only Chernyshevsky had a major, overwhelming influence on me, and it began with \"What is to be done''*\n\n- Lenin\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAfter another wave of executions and deportations against the narodnik revolutionaries, their activities slowed down. In the late '80s early '90s all these movements converged into 2 main political organisations \u2013  Socialist Revolutionaries Party (SR's) that gathered the most extreme and 'narodnik' elements who militated for ''Black Redistribution'' and (later) opposed October Revolution. And the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party that gathered the more 'marxist' oriented people with the difference being that the RSDWP stated from the beginning that they renounce all acts of political terror, taking the marxist way of organizing the people towards a common revolutionary goal. Most people don't know that the 'bolsheviks' who executed the royal family were actually SR's who joined the bolsheviks after the revolution. To make SR's opposition to October Revolution look even worse, the next day after taking power the Bolsheviks accomplished the century dream of Russian peasantry by enacting the Black Redistribution via their ''Decree on Land''.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHerzen's novel ''Who is to Blame?'' (1846) and later Chernishevsky's ''What is to be Done?'' became the staples of 19th century Russian revolutionary thought inspiring generations of revolutionaries who would later lead the October Revolution. There's also a saying, a kind of meme, that the Russian peoples main existential questions are ''who is to blame?'' and ''what is to be done?''", "edited": 1627392273.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Marxist-Leninist"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The importance of Chernishevsky comes from his radical revolutionary take on the so called &amp;#39;abolition of serfdom&amp;#39; which since that time has split Russian historiography in two with the liberals, monarchists, and conservatives saying that the &amp;#39;abolition&amp;#39; was actually a good thing and it came at a normal time and that it was a natural process which improved the peasants condition. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What makes Chernyshevsky&amp;#39;s take genius and &amp;#39;on the right side of history&amp;#39; is not only the objective truth that he observed and criticized, but that he used traditional russian revolutionary framework combined with his knowledge of political economy and dialectics (of that time) to formulate an incredibly valuable dialectical materialist critique of the society he lived in (both politically and artistically).

During this time it was bureaucrat hunting season with many officers, aristocrats, government employees being assassinated left and right by &amp;#39;Narodnik&amp;#39; organisations, quickly followed by waves of executions and repression against the revolutionaries by the state. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1879, from the ashes of &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Land and Will&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and the Narodnik terrorist organisation &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Freedom or Death&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, revolutionary-terrorist organisation &amp;#39;&amp;#39;People&amp;#39;s Will&amp;#39;&amp;#39; is formed with the goal of using radical methods to force the Russian state to adopt democratic reforms and to push society towards socialism and revolution. Bomb explosions, assassinations, bank robberies, everything was on the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On 1st March 1881, &amp;#39;&amp;#39;The Liberator&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Alexander II (along with 3 other people, including a 14 year old boy) is assassinated by &amp;#39;&amp;#39;People&amp;#39;s Will&amp;#39;&amp;#39; with a bomb explosion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From 1881 until 1883 the Tsarist state organized mass repressions against revolutionaries -  hanging, executing, and exiling thousands of people. Regardless of these events, a weakened &amp;#39;&amp;#39;People&amp;#39;s Will&amp;#39;&amp;#39; continued to cause trouble and assassinate government figures all over Russia. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1887, symbolically also on 1st March, an assassination attempt is made on Tsar Alexander III by the unaffiliated organisation &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Terrorist Fraction of People&amp;#39;s Will&amp;#39;&amp;#39;. The attempt failed and the 15 plotters were arrested, half of them hanged, half exiled to Siberia. Among the hanged revolutionaries was Alexander Ulyanov, Lenin&amp;#39;s brother and one of the leaders of the organisation. This left a huge mark on 17 year old Lenin. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;What is to be done?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; was Alexander&amp;#39;s favorite book and although Lenin has already read it, he began a more thorough study of the work. He used to say \u201cThis thing charges you (like a battery) for your entire life&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Chernyshevsky&amp;#39;s articles I became interested in economic questions, especially in how the Russian village lived... Before I became acquainted with the works of Marx, Engels and Plekhanov, only Chernyshevsky had a major, overwhelming influence on me, and it began with &amp;quot;What is to be done&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lenin&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After another wave of executions and deportations against the narodnik revolutionaries, their activities slowed down. In the late &amp;#39;80s early &amp;#39;90s all these movements converged into 2 main political organisations \u2013  Socialist Revolutionaries Party (SR&amp;#39;s) that gathered the most extreme and &amp;#39;narodnik&amp;#39; elements who militated for &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Black Redistribution&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and (later) opposed October Revolution. And the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party that gathered the more &amp;#39;marxist&amp;#39; oriented people with the difference being that the RSDWP stated from the beginning that they renounce all acts of political terror, taking the marxist way of organizing the people towards a common revolutionary goal. Most people don&amp;#39;t know that the &amp;#39;bolsheviks&amp;#39; who executed the royal family were actually SR&amp;#39;s who joined the bolsheviks after the revolution. To make SR&amp;#39;s opposition to October Revolution look even worse, the next day after taking power the Bolsheviks accomplished the century dream of Russian peasantry by enacting the Black Redistribution via their &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Decree on Land&amp;#39;&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Herzen&amp;#39;s novel &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Who is to Blame?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; (1846) and later Chernishevsky&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;&amp;#39;What is to be Done?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; became the staples of 19th century Russian revolutionary thought inspiring generations of revolutionaries who would later lead the October Revolution. There&amp;#39;s also a saying, a kind of meme, that the Russian peoples main existential questions are &amp;#39;&amp;#39;who is to blame?&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;&amp;#39;what is to be done?&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_osgizz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/communism101/comments/osgizz/help_understanding_what_is_to_be_done/h6pb9b2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/osgizz/help_understanding_what_is_to_be_done/", "name": "t1_h6pb9b2", "author_flair_template_id": "f6837272-5bc6-11eb-b13e-0eb9705e04e5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/communism101", "author_flair_text": "Marxist-Leninist", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1627391148.0, "created_utc": 1627391148.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/osgizz/help_understanding_what_is_to_be_done/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2uc81", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Help Understanding \u201cWhat is to be done\u201d", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 10, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "communism101", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "h6pb7o9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "-saats", "num_comments": 5, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_osgizz", "score": 10, "author_fullname": "t2_6shy5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I wrote this (on another server) as a response to the question of Lenin's relation to Chernishevsky but it tackles the history and revolutionary process of 19th century Russia. In 1863 Chernishevsky wrote his novel (also titled) ''What is to be done?'' which became the staple for Russian revolutionary thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nChernishevsky was arguably the biggest influence on Lenin after Marx. Autocrat Tsarist Russia being the type of conservative monolith state that it was produced within itself a revolutionary process that developed slowly from the 17th century and culminated with the October Revolution.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe main issue for Russian peasants was the problem of land. 'Land' as it was understood by the deeply Orthodox peasant consciousness was something that belonged to God and God only. No man could poses that which was given to man by God. As feudalism developed and conditions worsened, serfdom became more and more unbearable for both material and 'philosophical' reasons (relationship of private property with land). Even though Tsarist Russia was huge on the map, they had very little arable land (something like 15% of their territory), combined with their harsh climate and agriculture (survival itself) becomes a gamble. Over the years these conditions led to Russian villages adopting a 'communal' type of agriculture where everyone worked on the same fields and used the same tools in order to work as efficiently as possibly because any mistake could lead to famine and death of the entire village. The 'dream' of Russian peasantry was the so called 'black redistribution' with 'black' meaning 'universal' as in the land would be redistrubuted equally on the basis of communal land work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThere were 3 main events that formed the consciousness of the 19th century revolutionary society that was to come: Bolotnikov's Uprising (1606-1607) / Razin's Uprising (1667-1671) / Pugachev's Uprising (1773-1775). They were uprisings and all out peasant wars against feudal lords and the conditions of serfdom as a whole. These uprising had a clear class character: they were uprisings of the lower classes against the ruling class. Besides these 3 major events there were thousands of smaller uprisings and local wars. Throughout this hard bloody struggle the Russian peasants were formed as a class, as in they evolved within their specific material conditions and formed their own particular characteristics. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn 1825 another major event happened \u2013 the Decembrists Revolt. After beating Napoleon and marching to France and back, imperial Russian officers (they were all noblemen of some kind) came to see their country in ruins, their people living much worse than the French peasants, and the overall backwardness of conservative Tsarist Russia, as opposed to the more liberal-bourgeoisie  views that they came into contact with in Europe. So how come the greatest Empire in the world that managed to beat Napoleon lets its people live like this? Combine this with a succession crisis in the Romanov dynasty and the time bomb was set. This time, as opposed to the peasant revolts of the past, the 'revolution' came from within (or 'from above'). The Decembrists started as a 'circle' or a social club where officers, writers, scientists, and the more progressive parts of the aristocracy gathered to find solutions to improve Russia. They tried to stage a military coup to oppose Nicholas I ascension to the throne and demanded some kind of liberalization of the autocracy, emancipation of the serfs, and liberal political reforms. They failed miserably and were arrested, some executed, others sent to Siberia. They became legends in the peoples counscious and contributed to moving the revolutionary process forward.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \n\nIn 1861, Tsar Alexander II issues the \u201cManifesto on the Abolition of Serfdom\u201d earning ''The Liberator'' nickname. Of course, this 'abolition' was nothing more than some black ink on white paper. Marx and Engels called it 'a fraudulent scam'. The manifesto meant absolutely nothing because the peasant, even though he was now technically 'free', had nowhere else to work except where he worked all his life - his masters fields. Not only that, but many serfs who were 'house serfs' living with their lords, were now 'free' to be homeless. And guess where these new poor peasants went to find work? Back to the lords. So not only the manifesto didn't 'abolish' anything, it made things a lot worse, transforming past feudal relationship into a new, capitalist ones.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nRussian society was getting more and more broken and bloodthirsty and radical movements started to form. The basis for their formation and philosophy, besides the emancipation of the peasant and land distribution, was the everything that has been tried so far, failed. Peasant revolts and uprisings, military coups, petitions, articles and proclamations. Nothing has even come close to ending the autocracy and the noblemen that have exploited the peasants for centuries. Something much more radical should be tried.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nOut of this historical line two main revolutionary currents were born \u2013 the so called 'Russian Nihilism' (represented by revolutionary writers like Chernishevsky and Pisarev) and 'Narodnichestvo'. The term 'nihilism' was mostly attributed by the (conservative) intelligentsia of that time, seeing revolutionary character as 'denying' what is 'natural' (Autocracy, Orthodox church, traditional values, etc.). Pisarev and most other thinkers denied the term because obviously it wasn't 'nihilism' but 'materialism'. That's why it's weird to think that Chernishevsky, who was considered a 'nihilist' could write the passage that you wrote in your post because a 'nihilist' wouldn't want to 'make people happy'. The main idea was that the conservative aristocratic elite was shocked that even after the 'abolition' of serfdom these pesky peasants were still not happy and these 'revolutionary democrat' writers were pouring gas into the fire.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nChernishevsky influenced 'Narodnichestvo', which was a kind of agrarian (non-Marxist) utopian socialist movement for land redistribution (Black Redistribution) that the Socialist-Revolutionaries (SR's) represented. This was a natural process because all revolutionary movements had 'the peasants' as the subject of their work (the most exploited class, 'the people' themselves) so the main problem of land redistribution that only became worse after the failed 'emancipation' came to a boiling point in mid to late 19th century when  the synthesis of all the historical struggle of the peasants and these new philosophical and social movements driven by a young, materialist intelligentsia pushed the revolutionary process even further and gave birth to something new - political terrorism. It was the idea that through individual terrorist acts we can bring the monarchy to an end and bring socialism (this was largely understood as abolition of feudalism and capitalism, 'peoples power' (Narodnichestvo), and  land redistribution)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 1861 a secret revolutionary organisation \u201cLand and Will\u201d is formed. Philosophically guided by the ideas of Herzen and Chernishevsky (their main inspiration but not an actual member) they proposed the abolition of monarchy, radical changes in society, and the calling of a 'Classless Peoples's Assembly'. One year later, the leaders of the organisation along with other revolutionary intellectuals (including Pisarev and Turghenev) were arrested on the charges of organising St. Petersburg fires (a series of terrible mass fires that lasted for 2 weeks). Rumors in town were spreading that these 'revolutionaries' and 'nihilists' were setting the city on fire trying to create chaos. Of course, they were no proofs against them for the fire itself, but the trial gave a perfect opportunity to the Tsarist regime to exercise violent repressions (executions, hangings, and labor camps) against the revolutionaries and to close their newspapers and gathering places.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAll this time Chernishevsky was under surveillance by the Tsarist secret police due to his affiliation with L&amp;W and his infamous revolutionary proclamation in response to Tsar's abolition manifesto - 'A bow to the poor peasants from their well-wishers'  (the insinuation being that these 'well-wishers' noblemen would never actually do anything good for the peasants and that the 'abolition' was just a 'bow', a symbolic gesture)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn 1862 he is arrested. He was 32 years old at this time and even though his health was deteriorating in prison he wrote ''What is to be done?'' and other texts during this 22 month prison stay before he was 'officialy trialed' in february 1864 for ''conspiring to subvert the existing order, for taking measures to cause indignation, and for writing the indignant proclamation 'A bow to the poor peasants from their well-wishers.'' and condemned to 7 years of hard labor in mines, eternal settlement in Siberia, and deprivation of all rights.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn may 1864, before being sent away, Chernishevsky was given a 'cashiering' or a public degradation ceremony called 'civil sentence' when a spade was ceremonially broken over his head to symbolize loss of all rights. 3000 people came to see this 'public event'. From now until his death at 61 years old (in 1889), Chernishevsky will spend the rest of his life in labor camps and special banishment places in Siberia as a person without any human rights. There were many attempts to rescue him but unfortunately they all failed. He never 'broke' from these experiences and still managed to write when he had the time, always staying true to the revolutionary cause and spirit and keeping contacts with revolutionaries all over the world.\n\n&amp;nbsp;", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Marxist-Leninist"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this (on another server) as a response to the question of Lenin&amp;#39;s relation to Chernishevsky but it tackles the history and revolutionary process of 19th century Russia.

The heroes make the people, transform them from a crowd into people, thus say the Social-Revolutionaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people make the heroes, thus reply the Bolsheviks to the Social-Revolutionaries. The book carries water to the windmill of the Social-Revolutionaries. No matter which book it is that brings the water to the windmill of the Social-Revolutionaries, this book is going to drown in our common, Bolshevik cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suggest we burn this book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;J.
