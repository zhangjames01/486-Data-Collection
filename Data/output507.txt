This fact will be relevant if you keep reading. I have a biochem background (Bachelor's degree), and obesity science has piqued my interest since I was a sophomore nearly 20 years ago.\n\nShort answer: No. Your life is not ruined. \n\nLong answer: Obesity is a chronic disease. Unfortunately, it's not always viewed that way. I can walk into a doctor today and in all the codes that come up from the visit, none of them will be Obesity. \n\nThis bothers me because we really don't have a way to put into context that essentially many people who have obesity will always run a nearly certain chance of always returning to obesity-weight. I feel like even though I have a BMI of 29 right now, I should be considered \"obese.\"\n\nYou and I, through bad habits, environment, our upbringing, and possibly a touch of genetics, we gained way too much weight. Unfortunately, we did some damage during this process. Much can be reversed, but here's a layout of some of what we did to ourselves, and what that means for the future:\n\n- Cardiovascular health. Our hearts work harder. We pump more. Our hearts are big. That's not good. While we likely have strong hearts, it's not the same type of \"good\" strength that an athlete develops. It's strength to pump blood through extra miles and miles of vessels in the many pounds of adipose tissue in us (that's fat tissue). **Losing weight, however, will immediately being improving this**. \n- Arteries. You have probably developed some, but not a problematic amount of plaque in your arteries. You have the luxury of time. If you reverse your habits and find ways to lose and keep weight off, you will increase your chances of avoiding a heart attack later in life. With that said -** arterial plaques are almost permanent.** Unless you do incredible amounts of fasting and exercise, they don't really go away. Drugs don't do much either. There's emerging research on some drugs and supplements that may help (look up nattokinase and lumbrokinase studies)...but overall, there's not really much that can be done to reduce this. \n- Hypertension. You already are dealing with this I see. If you lose weight, this will almost certainly drop. You're 27, so not much damage has been done because of high blood pressure, but the longer it's high, the more damage you'll do. One of the big ones is that it reduces the elasticity of your arteries, which will encourage plaque growth. \n- Insulin resistance. Insulin resistance basically describes your body cells' ability to use insulin. Obesity increases insulin resistance. Through some series of processes from immunological (cytokines) to endocrine (secreting a lot of insulin all the time), our excess fat cells are doing a lot to kill our insulin tolerance and increase our insulin resistance. If this gets bad enough, and you can't control your blood sugar, it becomes diabetes. It will become harder for you to avoid insulin resistance the longer you're obese. \n- Staying Obese. **This one absolutely sucks and is your biggest hurdle**. Fat cells don't go away. Well - they do, but they cycle out over the course of up-to 7 years or so. If you have obesity, however, the ones that go away are quickly replaced by new ones. This is the biggest reason people don't lose weight without DRAMATIC intervention like gastric bypass or pharmaceuticals. There's also emerging research on Fecal matter transplants (FMT) that may improve your gut microbiota to help improve your hunger cues and overall what you eat. Most studies show that there's not much success beyond two years of diet and exercise. **The weight almost always returns.**\n\n***\n\nBut you're not broken. You're not ruined. You have a long road ahead, but you're not ruined. \n\n***\n\nAfter numerous diets, after battling hard with willpower and discipline, after consulting with friends, family, and internet strangers...nothing worked. \n\nMy brother, who is 44 and used to weight 420LBS sought out a telehealth provider who put him on a GLP-1 drug (ozempic). He's been on it for just about a year and he's currently 285LBS. \n\nI also jumped on a GLP-1 drug and I went from 257LBS to 201LBS today, starting in October of last year. \n\nThese drugs are going to save a lot of lives, and if you struggle and you can't seem to lose weight and keep it off, they may be an option for you to discuss with your doctor. If your doctor doesn't want to play ball (unless you have a thyroid cancer risk), then go see another doctor. An endocrinologist. A weight loss specialist.\n\nMany health care professionals won't recognize obesity as the chronic disease that it is, and instead view it as something that can be fixed with diet and exercise. We already know diet/exercise has incredible failure rates. \n\nGLP-1 drugs are highly accessible, have mild side effects, and have worked miracles for people. \n\nFunny enough, they were developed to treat diabetes, but they may be the single best tool to PREVENT diabetes because they're so effective at weight loss. \n\nHave these discussions with your doctor.
