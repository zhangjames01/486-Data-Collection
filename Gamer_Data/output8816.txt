Working out is demonstrate-able, physically apparent measure of determination and consistency. There are indeed people who can take shortcuts via steroids and other drugs - and they tarnish the reputation of our hard work. But for the most part, working out to get a decent level of fitness does take -time and effort- towards a goal that -only you- are able to work through. There is no person who can magically take a barbell and load 400 pounds on it and lift it 5 times. Only through *work* can you do this, which is why the people who *can* are impressive.\n\nAdmittedly, genetics plays a huge factor in this. But I'm more arguing for being the best that you can be, rather than comparing oneself to others - which, I think, was also Xebo's point. People who take constructive criticism are going to be those who can learn in order to become better for ourselves... rather than those who are ignoring it. The pinnacle of successful attitude, I think he was trying to state, is not caring what the 'Haters' (or naysayers, or what have you) think - if YOU know what is good for YOU. So if weightlifting is great for him, and other people (like you?) say that it's not worthwhile, then he has to know that he's still going to do what's right for him. \n\nMeanwhile, if you were to give him constructive criticism and say \"Hey buddy, I think you're devoting too much time towards your physique -- maybe pick up this great book that I think you'd like?\" and he IGNORED that and actively told you HIS way was the ONLY right way, then yes- he's a fucking idiot. But the successful attitude is about bettering oneself and realizing how and where you can improve yourself. \n\nI'm of the belief that yes, I'm never wrong. Because I try to think out your (anyone but my own) positions on things, and formulate my own opinion on things. Therefore, my own position is 'right', until you successfully defend your point to a point that give me a new perspective - at which time, I'll hopefully acknowledge that you helped me, and I'd take up a new position which is \"Right.\"\n\nIt's a thin line, the difference between having an open mind and a closed one. Can a man not be firm in his own ideological stances? Is that not how we achieve meaningful discourse? So that when I tell you, \"I'm right\" in everything, it's more of a plea for you to try to show me how I'm not - until we either meet in the middle or walk away from one another. Sociopathic?

Only through &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; can you do this, which is why the people who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; are impressive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, genetics plays a huge factor in this. But I&amp;#39;m more arguing for being the best that you can be, rather than comparing oneself to others - which, I think, was also Xebo&amp;#39;s point. People who take constructive criticism are going to be those who can learn in order to become better for ourselves... rather than those who are ignoring it. The pinnacle of successful attitude, I think he was trying to state, is not caring what the &amp;#39;Haters&amp;#39; (or naysayers, or what have you) think - if YOU know what is good for YOU. So if weightlifting is great for him, and other people (like you?) say that it&amp;#39;s not worthwhile, then he has to know that he&amp;#39;s still going to do what&amp;#39;s right for him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, if you were to give him constructive criticism and say &amp;quot;Hey buddy, I think you&amp;#39;re devoting too much time towards your physique -- maybe pick up this great book that I think you&amp;#39;d like?&amp;quot; and he IGNORED that and actively told you HIS way was the ONLY right way, then yes- he&amp;#39;s a fucking idiot. But the successful attitude is about bettering oneself and realizing how and where you can improve yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m of the belief that yes, I&amp;#39;m never wrong. Because I try to think out your (anyone but my own) positions on things, and formulate my own opinion on things. Therefore, my own position is &amp;#39;right&amp;#39;, until you successfully defend your point to a point that give me a new perspective - at which time, I&amp;#39;ll hopefully acknowledge that you helped me, and I&amp;#39;d take up a new position which is &amp;quot;Right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a thin line, the difference between having an open mind and a closed one. Can a man not be firm in his own ideological stances? Is that not how we achieve meaningful discourse? So that when I tell you, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m right&amp;quot; in everything, it&amp;#39;s more of a plea for you to try to show me how I&amp;#39;m not - until we either meet in the middle or walk away from one another. Sociopathic? Only if you choose to define it that way.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1kvvm8", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/bodybuilding/comments/1kvvm8/bodybuilding_hate_described_by_joe_rogan_good/cbtx427/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/1kvvm8/bodybuilding_hate_described_by_joe_rogan_good/", "name": "t1_cbtx427", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bodybuilding", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1377284628.0, "created_utc": 1377284628.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpCQmnhSdos"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ql8s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Bodybuilding Hate described by Joe Rogan, good listen", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "bodybuilding", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cbtwnjg", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Zarent", "num_comments": 258, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cbtw8yo", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_4s9vv", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 1, "body": "I'm trying to help out too here, dude. \n\nYou say your willpower is educating yourself and the people around you.

So it's appropriate that this is spoken about within the bodybuilding subreddit.\n\nWhen you're in the context of the masses - in 'society's reality' - you can generally have an idea of what types of people you most respect and what character traits are inherent in them. Physical fitness is one of these things for me, probably for everyone in this subreddit, and a large majority of the people in the United States. It's a form of respect - people in good physical shape generally seem to have an easier time socially, right?\n\nSo you, as the individual, recognize that you want that. You figure out how to do it - doing a few pushups at home between videogame sessions, by just hopping into the gym and throwing yourself on whatever machine looks fanciest, by asking your family how to do it, or latching onto a gymbuddy who's stronger than you. Some of us went to 4chan and started Starting Strength. Some of us do P90X or Crossfit or Zumba. Then, as a matter of principle, we get -better- at achieving what we want... and you can choose to continue that.

Or to be able to do a pull up. Maybe you're happy with that. Maybe, within this bodybuilding subreddit, you're 'never satisfied'  with your strengths or looks. Thats an issue in itself.\n\nBut then you can take a look around at the masses of people around you. You see them. Your mom, who is trying a 3rd fad diet. Your two weaker friends who really do want to be able to do a single pullup. Or the skinnyfat girls who are starving themselves. Or fat people talking about thin privilege. Entire businessmodels of magazines being sold to *lots* of people on How to Lose 15 Lbs in 1 Week by Doing Nothing!!\n\nAnd for me, frustration sets in - because it honestly ISN'T hard to get fit. Everyone else is taking the easy way out by *not trying*. By chalking it up to a Thyroid disorder, or a learning disability, or God, or something out of their control. It only takes a goal (I want to be fit!), and then taking the individual steps to -get- there. The people around you, who are languishing in their own self-pity about 'I'm not as strong/sexy/stretchy/whateverthefuck as I want to be', well, why haven't they started their journey yet? If I could do it, can't they? The only thing separating them from me: willpower. Every fucking one has the potential for that. It's just deciding in each moment to do what is the right choice for your future self.\n\nThis doesn't just apply for physical fitness, obviously. It's seeing life as a series of short term moments for how to better yourself. If, at the end of the day, I could've played 6 hours of my favorite online videogame (DotA!) and spent 2 hours surfing reddit, then thats the end of that day. Or I could've practiced guitar and read a book and ran errands before their deadline and really gotten to know a friend (as opposed to just talking about actors and movies and funny youtube clips) and went on a bikeride to a place I'd never been... well, which should I have done? Which -should- you do? \n\nWhere does your willpower run out? \n\nIs it in the middle of the day, after you've read a book and practiced guitar - and then you want some time to destress and surf reddit? What if that ~5 minute break on reddit turns into an hour - did you 'lose' that hour, because you weren't productive? Does guilt set in?\n\nOr is it after months or years of doing this shit to yourself, of choosing the 'right' path moment after moment, and now yeah, you're finally happy with your body and you're well-read and you can play guitar and look you're joining charity groups and I guess you're going to travel because what else should you do to be 'better' than the You who wouldn't have? \n\nCan you **ever** stop?\n\nSo yes, we are sociopaths. If I disagree with the masses, it's because they're wrong, and weaker than me, because their willpower ran out before it ever started. I -want- them to challenge my ideas directly, so that I can help them realize that I'm fucking right -- and once I do, to help them Start Today to be where they want to be X amount of time from now.

It seems, honestly, that Zerg has an incredibly varied way to make effective unit comps besides the Infestor/Broodlord combo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_yyqgy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/starcraft/comments/yyqgy/what_if_fungal_slowed_not_held_suggestions_please/c60kc68/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/yyqgy/what_if_fungal_slowed_not_held_suggestions_please/", "name": "t1_c60kc68", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starcraft", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1346262489.0, "created_utc": 1346262489.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/6412423522?page=1#0"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpp6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What if Fungal slowed, not held?
