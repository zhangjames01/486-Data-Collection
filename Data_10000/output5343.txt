was very enamored with the idea from science that if you know the position, speed, and vector of all objects you can perfectly predict the future. Both Dune and Foundation tap into this by featuring the ability to predict the future by understanding and manipulating the development of human society.\n\nIn Dune, prescience is the result of having perfect awareness of the past and the present and using that to fully extrapolate events that will come to pass. You need a vast ocean of data to extrapolate from, and an altered state of consciousness that can allow you both to hold all that information in your head and to subconsciously visualise a simulation of how a timeline might progress.\n\nThere are a few major aspects of information in the Dune series that in particular make Prescience possible:\n\n1. Genetic memory. By surviving the spice agony of a melange overdose, Reverend Mothers can access *all knowledge, memory, and personality* of their female ancestors. Paul and Leto II can also access all their male ancestors. This not only allows them to explore historical events in vivid detail but also draw on hundreds of thousands of years of human intuition and insight into how human beings react to stimuli. For the Bene Gesserit (and the Atreides Emperors) this also means having direct access to *the plans and schemes and designs of previous Reverend Mothers.*\n\n2. Mentat training. To replace thinking machines, humans remade themselves in their image. The mentat school trains gifted students in how to hold vast amounts of information and how to perform detailed and accurate calculations and statistical predictions using that information. \n\n3. Sociological manipulation. Mankind in the Known Universe is not a wild-grown garden. It's a carefully tended display of engineered religions and static feudal governments that have existed for thousands of years unchanged. Groups like the Bene Gesserit have been designing human society *in a way that makes it more predictable*. For 10 000 years, the Bene Gesserit and the Guild were the only two groups able to accurately wield prescience, and they have gone to great lengths to shape mankind into a predictable shape.\n\nSo you have individuals like Paul and Leto II Atreides who can access the knowledge and memories and behavioral insights of millions of ancestors, complete insight into all the ways that the Bene Gesserit have rendered humanity predictable, and the mentat training to accurately manage all of that data.\n\nCombine all of that with the Spice, which throws the human mind into an altered state of consciousness that not only allows an oracle to hold all of this information in their mind as a whole, but also subconsciously synthesizes concrete visions of possible futures.\n\nPrescience is limited by what information an oracle has available to them. Technological solutions such as ixian no-chambers or no-ships are information gaps that an oracle cannot access, and Prescience can be fogged by introducing more random variance into a population (as the BG and Guild attempt on Arrakis with a new tarot in Messiah).
