If he ever tries to get near you or shows up where you are, do what you said you would do - he is the aggressor. I would obviously recommend calling the police in these instances unless he outright physically attacks you. And if you have to be around him and he says something crass and offensive, say it right back. People like this think it&amp;#39;s all fun and games until they&amp;#39;re the ones being targeted.
