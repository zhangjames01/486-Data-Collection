She is trying to put you in a situation you&amp;#39;re not comfortable with and your gf isn&amp;#39;t protecting you from it. Avoiding the threat of a bad situation is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, another option is calling her out whenever she hits on you. If you decide to go back, and she calls you sexy, ask her loud enough for others to hear &amp;quot;wait can you repeat that?&amp;quot; If she&amp;#39;s rubbing on your leg go &amp;quot;why are you rubbing on my leg?&amp;quot; Doing this immediately will be awkward, but that&amp;#39;s the point; after this, the roommate isn&amp;#39;t going to want to hit on you and risk that kind of awkwardness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will say, though, that gaining 50 pounds in a year or so is kind of extreme. I am not qualified to say if your girlfriend is depressed or something else is going on, but I am saying that while you are very understanding and accepting of her, you may want to ask how she feels. Not about just her weight, but life in general. This could be changing to a bad sedentary lifestyle, but it&amp;#39;s at least worth making sure that this isn&amp;#39;t a sign of her needing help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is just a note for the future, but you sound a lot like how I was. &lt;strong&gt;Relationships have two people in it&lt;/strong&gt;. What&amp;#39;s more, it&amp;#39;s created when two people think they are compatible. I see you giving a lot in this, and that is good, but please make sure you aren&amp;#39;t the only one putting effort into this. You made sure to get back in shape and stay loyal to her and comfort her about her weight. But you are afraid to ask her to lose weight with you? Relationships only work when both people are working to make it better. Just please take a look at where you are and make sure that you&amp;#39;re not getting taken advantage of, okay?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_75ckrl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/75ckrl/my_26m_girlfriend_23f_has_gained_weight_and_her/do5l60k/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/75ckrl/my_26m_girlfriend_23f_has_gained_weight_and_her/", "name": "t1_do5l60k", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1507606735.0, "created_utc": 1507606735.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/75ckrl/my_26m_girlfriend_23f_has_gained_weight_and_her/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "My[24m] gf[19f] of 7 months has BPD.
