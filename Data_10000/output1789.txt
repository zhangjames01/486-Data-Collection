I had an absurd ability to score points in FS and I found it at that tournament. My dad was proud of me, and it kinda washed off a stigma I felt of not being successful enough for being a \u201ccoach\u2019s son\u201d.\n\nKnowledge wise- Using a move another coach taught me to beat one of his wrestlers was a top notch moment. Bonus points for it being at a pretty big tournament, and my mom seeing it since she hardly ever watched me wrestle matches. \n\nCoaching wise- one of my HWTs was super small, only 200lbs, and he looked super dorky. Wore glasses, all body- skinny legs, really looked like a chump. One of his opponents at an IBT and opponents gf were talking shit and laughing as my kid walked to check in. Kid thought he had it in the bag and told his gf \u201cthis will be quick\u201d. He was right- my kid tossed and pinned him in less than a minute. \n\nCoaching Wise Pt 2.- Semis at states, my 113 is tied with short time in the 3rd. He\u2019d been getting close to an ankle pick all match but kept getting calf. Kids go out of bounds and I yell at my wrestler \u201cAnkle, not knee, ANKLE\u201d and point to my lower heel. My kid gets the same set up as he has been, but this time grabs down far enough to secure the pick, scoring 2 and making finals.

Bonus points for it being at a pretty big tournament, and my mom seeing it since she hardly ever watched me wrestle matches. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coaching wise- one of my HWTs was super small, only 200lbs, and he looked super dorky. Wore glasses, all body- skinny legs, really looked like a chump. One of his opponents at an IBT and opponents gf were talking shit and laughing as my kid walked to check in.

He was right- my kid tossed and pinned him in less than a minute. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coaching Wise Pt 2.- Semis at states, my 113 is tied with short time in the 3rd.
