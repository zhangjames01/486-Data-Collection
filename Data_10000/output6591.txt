However, he isn't entirely a bad person either and he clearly cares for his friends.

Meanwhile other routes do suggest that this sort of rough housing was just Sydney being himself. It was likely that TJ was never in any real risk, but the entity made Chase think he was&lt;/span&gt; so from Chase&amp;#39;s perspective he was doing the right thing. Echo&amp;#39;s theme of circles means that history and trauma repeat itself, so it all ends up happening again &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;with Flynn&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the main question, is Chase an asshole... lets just say that none of the characters are truly good. They all have their flaws and Chase has many. A constant theme with Chase tends to be him running away from problems and avoiding conflict. He is seen regularly lying, obscuring the truth or just otherwise being a bit of a selfish twat to his friends. A lot of this tends to come up with regards to his relationship with Leo. There are many good reasons Chase and Leo split up which are very easy to attribute to Leo, but Chase shares equal blame, if not more for what happened. However, he isn&amp;#39;t entirely a bad person either and he clearly cares for his friends. This is what makes Echo so great, since almost nothing in the story is so black and white as to who is &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; and who is &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;. They are all potentially good people, Echo just brings out the worst in them all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11hao0o", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/FurryVisualNovels/comments/11hao0o/is_chase_from_echo_an_asshole/jatin1s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FurryVisualNovels/comments/11hao0o/is_chase_from_echo_an_asshole/", "name": "t1_jatin1s", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FurryVisualNovels", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677885661.0, "created_utc": 1677885661.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FurryVisualNovels/comments/11hao0o/is_chase_from_echo_an_asshole/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3j1c8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "While ArchesVN is near to end maybe, I'm gonna pray for my boy Artie.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "FurryVisualNovels", "link_author": "Naatsookiee_", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jaqhb4w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Zhinrak", "num_comments": 36, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jan8xuy", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_70svs", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah yea, entirely forgot about that.
