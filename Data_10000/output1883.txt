Because if you want to tell me about the characters more than about the story then you've placed them in the wrong setting.\n\nThe setting is great for a story to unfold and the bare minimum information about the characters is enough for them to come alive in our minds automatically as the proceed to go through the story. \n\n6/10", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "Author", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I like the image of my mom\u2019s spirit being led to wherever she \nended up by these wise birds, with their powerful wings and all-knowing \nyellow eyes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nora\u2019s eyes are like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I very nearly punched the monitor here.
