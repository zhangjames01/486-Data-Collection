People do still argue about it to this day with differing opinions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the way back, there was a lot of controversy about whether or not continuing the Apple IIE/IIC was a good idea or to shift to the Macintosh/Lisa etc. In 1984 the Apple IIE was in a lot of homes. It had a pretty open expansion architecture. The line was falling behind by Apple&amp;#39;s focus on the Lisa and Mackintosh which where shifting to limited openness, but also some amazing new technologies like a desktop UI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a rift between Jobs and Wozniak over this very issue and Job&amp;#39;s pushing the Mackintosh into more and more proprietary territory that Wozniak did not like at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe that&amp;#39;s what he meant?

They even admitted that they sent a letter out with the incorrect date for the trial... but there's some side notes.\n\n* In a bail bond in his state, they give you your trial date when they accept the bond. If the date was wrong on the bond, then it's wrong and can be presented. No one has ever shown the bail bond was wrong as far as I know\n\n* Even if he was somehow completely confused his wife sent this letter... Ellsworth quoted a letter sent to him just before the trial was scheduled and signed by Weaver's wife as saying, \"Whether we live or whether we die, we will not bow to your evil commandments.\" Laced with phrases like \"war is open upon the land,\" and \"the tyrants' blood will flow,\" the letter was interpreted by Ellsworth as a threat, he testified.\n\n* When was Randy Weaver's son shot and kicked off everything. So the date in the letter said March 20th instead of February 20th for trial. The confrontation was on august 21st? Why didn't he go to his court date on March 20th? He accidently missed his court date by 5 months even if it was the wrong date?\n\nTo the U.S. Attorney, she sent that letter. He was not the only one, they sent letters like this to shit tons of people. So, I say again. He was refusing to go to that trial and despite the incorrect date on the letter, he was given a date during his Bond... even then, the mix up of dates very likely would have been addressed.\n\nIf you have an arrest warrant, you do not discuss the details at gun point while barricaded on your hill sending letters to everyone saying that kind of stuff. Some of the trial stuff was held in Boise BTW. I wonder what people in Boise and rural Idaho think about government overreach? The federal agencies handled things poorly, but also, Randy Weaver wanted a fight and then regretted it.\n\nThe proper response to legal troubles like this is not to kill a federal agent. Take it to court. I mean the entire Aryan nation was already behind the weavers. Hell, bunch of skin heads even showed up to protest at the road block to Ruby ridge on behalf of the Weavers.\n\nhttps://thumb.spokesman.com/CNbfCryQ2jtfpV-AkOHcZ6V6_7s=/2500x0/media.spokesman.com/photos/2012/08/19/19_rubyridge_vigil.jpg\n\nhttps://thumb.spokesman.com/qeheHCjHAu0N2loG4Zn9D-IeMis=/1200x800/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2012/08/19/RUBY_RIDGE_PROTESTERS_21220899.JPG", "edited": 1677197059.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How is he going to comply with a warrant considering the legal system fucked up so hard that they couldn&amp;#39;t even give him the correct date for his trial?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you purposefully throw out half the information?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, even with a messed up date, that can be addressed. They even admitted that they sent a letter out with the incorrect date for the trial... but there&amp;#39;s some side notes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bail bond in his state, they give you your trial date when they accept the bond. If the date was wrong on the bond, then it&amp;#39;s wrong and can be presented. No one has ever shown the bail bond was wrong as far as I know&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if he was somehow completely confused his wife sent this letter... Ellsworth quoted a letter sent to him just before the trial was scheduled and signed by Weaver&amp;#39;s wife as saying, &amp;quot;Whether we live or whether we die, we will not bow to your evil commandments.&amp;quot; Laced with phrases like &amp;quot;war is open upon the land,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the tyrants&amp;#39; blood will flow,&amp;quot; the letter was interpreted by Ellsworth as a threat, he testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When was Randy Weaver&amp;#39;s son shot and kicked off everything. So the date in the letter said March 20th instead of February 20th for trial. The confrontation was on august 21st? Why didn&amp;#39;t he go to his court date on March 20th? He accidently missed his court date by 5 months even if it was the wrong date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To the U.S. Attorney, she sent that letter. He was not the only one, they sent letters like this to shit tons of people. So, I say again. He was refusing to go to that trial and despite the incorrect date on the letter, he was given a date during his Bond... even then, the mix up of dates very likely would have been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have an arrest warrant, you do not discuss the details at gun point while barricaded on your hill sending letters to everyone saying that kind of stuff. Some of the trial stuff was held in Boise BTW. I wonder what people in Boise and rural Idaho think about government overreach? The federal agencies handled things poorly, but also, Randy Weaver wanted a fight and then regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The proper response to legal troubles like this is not to kill a federal agent. Take it to court. I mean the entire Aryan nation was already behind the weavers.
