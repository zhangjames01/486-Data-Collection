Dogs, meanwhile, have been bred to coexist, in a subservient, utilitarian role, with humans. We domesticated them by enhancing their hierarchical nature, and placing ourselves at the top. Comparing the behaviors of domesticated dogs with undomesticated wolves is essentially meaningless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I&amp;#39;d take issue with how the cited study was conducted: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here, among thousands of group interactions, individual one-on-one exchanges were selected for analysis. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have time to read the paper right now, but that&amp;#39;s a bit flag for potential selection bias. If they selected interactions at random, then that&amp;#39;d reduce the risk, but if they were looking for &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; interactions, then they might&amp;#39;ve just selected interactions which supported their hypothesis, rather than interactions which were representative of behavioral patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_83r9jp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/politics/comments/83r9jp/after_taunting_republicans_for_being_afraid_of/dvkrwml/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/83r9jp/after_taunting_republicans_for_being_afraid_of/", "name": "t1_dvkrwml", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/politics", "author_flair_text": "New York", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1520866229.0, "created_utc": 1520866229.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/after-taunting-gop-as-afraid-of-nra-trump-gives-in-to-nra.html"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2cneq", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "After Taunting Republicans for Being Afraid of NRA, Trump Gives In to NRA", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "politics", "link_author": "tototoki", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dvkr7gp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Tusularah", "num_comments": 584, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dvkp9xs", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3m7ds", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 1, "body": "I dunno.
