We had already closed for the night and we're cleaning up when the owner came out and said he needed to split for some reason or another, I forgot why. As I was a giant dude, he chose me to take his keys and the security system code and lock up when we were done then drop the keys off at his house on my way home. A huge no-no, but I liked the guy so I agreed to do it, I liked that he trusted me enough to do it.\n\nWe finish and I set the alarm and lock up. I'm on my way to his house to drop off the keys when he calls and tells me I need to go back because I didn't set the alarm correctly (he got a notification from the alarm system that it had been disarmed shortly after I left). So I turn around and go back.\n\nThe door is still locked when I get there, and nothing is broken so it looks like I did fuck up. As I head to the back to arm the alarm again I hear a noise from the Manager's/accounting office that seems familiar.\n\nI open the door and there is the co-owner (aka the owner's son) railing a morning prep girl on the Manager's desk. They scream and flail, I tell them to calm down. He asks what I am doing there and I tell him that the owner asked me to check on the alarm because it was disabled. Hold on while I make a call.\n\nHe goes sheet white when her realizes that I just dialed his dad, but to their credit, they both remained absolutely quiet while I spoke: \"Hey boss? Yeah I'm at the store now. Yeah I set the alarm right.

Yeah he's still here, let me put him on.\u201d\n\nI hand my phone to the co-owner and he is shaking like a leaf, but he kept his composure on the line \"Yeah, . . Uh-huh. . . No he did good, everything is clean and ready for the am shift. Okay. . . See you tonight, bye.\"\n\nHe hands me back my phone and starts thanking me but I stop him and point at both him and the lady. \" Y'all didn't do anything near the food prep areas, did you?\" They both shake their heads no. \"Okay good. Now clean and sterilize this area before you leave. You just confirmed with your dad that everything was good for the day, so if something is off it's now your ass not mine, got it? I'm going home.\"\n\nI then left them to get dressed and clean up. Dropped the keys off to the owner and went to bed. My next shift the owner calls me into the Manager's office as soon as my shift starts and I knew I was fucked. I go in and he tells me to shut the door behind me before swiveling his computer monitor around to show me the security camera footage of his son and the prep girl half naked while I am standing in the office doorway on my cell. \"Fuck, this is it, I need to get a new job\", I thought.\n\nThe owner looks at me and says \"I don't appreciate being lied to. . .\" I know all the color has drained from my face by now and he can see that I'm on the verge of shitting myself. \"But I understand that you were in a bad situation and I believe you handed it as tactfully as you could without causing a problem for me or my idiot. I was considering letting you go with just this warning, but then I saw this.\"\n\nHe then fast forwards the footage and it shows the two lovers freaking out after I left for a few minutes before collecting themselves and spending the next hour or so cleaning and sanitizing the office before leaving. \"I was actually tipped off that something was off when I came in and noticed this office was TOO clean, so I decided to check the camera.
