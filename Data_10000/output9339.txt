Like communism, I guess? It would be a great idea if only it worked instead of lead to harm.\n\nWe know what happens when we raise the minimum wage because we've done it. It's good. It helps the lower classes. If they believe it harms people while every shred of evidence disagrees with them, they are deluded. \n\n&gt; Some call the Scandinavian system \"communism\" and mock it because it's rightly collapsing under mass-migration.\n\nThe Scanadinavian system isn't even close to communism, and also isn't collapsing by any measure of the word. They are doing significantly better than America by essentially every single metric, and have been for decades. \n\n&gt; However, you've never heard of this evidence, because your biased news would never tell you if \"their side\" did something bad. I'd hope that this is obvious to you, and something that you've already taken into account.\n\nI have heard of this \"evidence\", or at least examples of it. None of it was real. Every silver bullet I've seen conservatives touting has been completely false. I can't say I've definitively looked into every one that exists, but I've looked into every one I've encountered and not a single one held any water. Further, the mechanism for electoral fraud typically described (dead people voting, absentee ballot abuse, and similar multi-voting schemes) are highly tracible, easily discoverable, and totally ineffective at actually stealing an election. \n\n&gt; Who cares about \"the fairness of the electoral system\"? It was only criticized because people didn't like the outcome.\n\nThe Presidency was won by someone who lost the popular vote exactly five times in US history: 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. Of these, 1824 was won by a Democratic-Republican (John Adams) against a Democratic-Republican (Andrew Jackson), 1876 was a Republican (Rutherford Hayes) beating a Democrat (Samuel Tiden), 1888 was a Republican (Ben Harrison) beating a Democrat (Grover Cleveland), 2000 was a Republican (George W Bush) beating a Democrat (Al Gore), and 2016 was a Republican (Donald Trump) beating a Democrat (Hillary Clinton). You may be right, in a world where Dems were the ones getting the advantage, maybe they'd love the electoral college. But that's not the world we live in, and liberals or leftists being anti-electoral college isn't something either group really flip flops on.\n\n&gt; I don't know how much this is to be honest, but I'm more concerned about the amount of microplastics in my organs.\n\nThat's something you can (and should) be concerned about, and something that can (and should) be addressed as well. Plastic straw bans are definitely not enough, and more can and should be done to combat plastic pollutants. Corporations should absolutely be taken to task for their role in it, but the straw bans at least partially do that. They're focused at banning corporate behaviour rather than personal behaviour. More of that is good, not bad, and actions should go significantly further than the straw ban in doing so.\n\n&gt; and depression and anxiety increase mortality by quite a lot.\n\nNot as much as actually getting covid. Yes, there are real costs in mental and physical health for lockdowns. They pale in comparison to the cost of the covid cases that lockdowns prevent, and it's not even remotely close. \n\n&gt; Some areas with 90%+ vaccination still did not reach herd immunity. \n\nNo state in the US has achieved 90% vaccination rate to this day. By the time any of them do (if they ever do), Delta, Omnicron, and whatever else new variants will have already developed and spread through the population making herd immunity more difficult. That said, the covid vaccine is a poor vector for herd immunity anyways, as while it does make it less likely for you to get covid, its primary purpose is to dramatically lessen the symptoms rather than prevent you from catching it. It would be lovely if it could, and maybe we'll be able to develop something that does in the future, but right now vaccine rates are to protect the populace from symptoms rather than stopping the spread. That has to be done in other ways.\n\n&gt; but there's bound to be creeps who will abuse this if it's made too easy for them.\n\nCreeps can already abuse this by simply creeping on people in the bathroom they're allowed in, or else going into the bathroom they're not allowed in to assault someone. Trans bathroom bans do not prevent a single creep from doing creepy things, it just makes life more difficult and more dangerous for trans people. Trans people have been beaten for using both the bathroom that corresponds to their assigned gender at birth, and also for using the one that corresponds to their current gender, so its just being used as an excuse to assault trans people regardless of which bathroom they actually use.\n\n&gt; Trans military bans are not about rights. The problem was the high suicide rate of trans people, and that the military would have to pay for their transitioning. So people could join just for the free surgery.\n\nThe military has no problems paying for other treatments that don't affect battle readiness. They have no problem with people joining for free college. They have no problem with their servicemembers committing suicide either, judging by the servicemember suicide rates. But more importantly, when Trump announced the directive, [literally every member of the joint chiefs of staff said that trans service members weren't a problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/opinion/military-transgender-ban.html). It was a political move driven by nothing but bigotry. \n\n&gt; Marriage is just complicated. It's not easy to change all related laws to it. Why care anyway? It's largely symbolic. If you're non-religious perhaps you shouldn't care about such rituals.\n\nMarriage is actually supremely easy, because it didn't even need a law to change. Just a ruling that same sex marriages were to be treated the same as hetero marriages under the law. Also, symbolic doesn't mean meaningless, and marriage itself comes with a slew of tax, inheritance, and other benefits that gay people enjoy having access to, and should have access to by rights. \"Oh just live without it\" is not an adequate response to inequality.\n\n&gt; Racism is not a problem for anyone with actual problems in life. If racism is a problem for you, you're privileged. There's no such thing as \"systematic racism\" either, that goes against the very definition of racism. Non-human entities cannot discriminate against factors which are purely visual.\n\nI don't know how it is even possible to define racism in such a way as to make that statement true. Oh, you can't find a job because people [don't like your \"black\" name](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/job-applicants-with-black-names-still-less-likely-to-get-the-interview)? Not a real problem. Oh, the police keep [harassing you on the street based on the colour of your skin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8389488/)? Not a real problem. Oh, the police [disproportionately kill members of your ethnic group](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/)? Definitely not a real problem. Oh, the areas in which your ethnic group lived historically were [intentionally impoverished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining), and the areas that were affected are still to this day significantly poorer than other parts of the same city? No, not real at all. \n\nSystemic racism also doesn't fall out of the sky. It's made by humans. If you write a law that say \"Murdering X ethnicity is legal\", that law is systemically racist. Obviously that's an extreme example, but yes, absolutely non-human entities can be racist, because they're made by humans.\n\n&gt; If we stop thinking that skin color has any influence on ones being, then racism won't be possible either.\n\nIf *racists* stop thinking that, yes. Until they do, *victims of racism* need to keep talking about it.\n\n&gt; I wanted to show you that the real world has nuance \n\nYes.\n\n&gt; and that there's sensible arguments for every position. \n\nAbsolutely not. There's no sensible arguments for flat earth. There's no sensible arguments for white nationalism. There's no sensible arguments for fascism, or for corporate control of the earth. There are a *lot* of positions with no sensible arguments for them.\n\n&gt; Even if they're flawed or flat out wrong, it's not as simple as \"stupid people who want bad things to happen just because they're mean\"\n\nWith conservatism, it almost is. It's more \"Evil people want bad things to happen because it personally enriches them\" and \"Stupid, bigoted, or uninformed people go along with the evil people because they are stupid, bigoted, or uninformed\"", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You seem to be taking a left/right stance based purely on degree of authoritarianism which is...weird to say the least.

Instead, they have a small group of \"progressives\" who exist within a right wing party and tend to be center-left.\n\nThey don't want higher taxes, but they also oppose minimum wage increases, workplace safety, corporate regulation in general, tenant protection laws, and a host of other things that would make working class lives better.\n\nThey also oppose public healthcare in other countries, even ones with better healthcare than America (notably Canada and the UK). They are often mocking or otherwise denigrating countries that have better implementation of healthcare.\n\nThey claimed that an election they lost was fraudulent without a shred of evidence of election fraud, and then when evidence *did* show up, the vast majority of it was *Republicans* committing it. Compare that to the democrat version, who didn't dispute the *veracity* of the election (i.e. didn't say the republicans cheated, broke the law, or anything), but instead disputed the *fairness of the electoral system* (specifically, the fact that the president lost the popular vote but won the presidency).\n\nI like how for this one you talk about plastic straws as a ratio of plastics being used, and not as a ratio of plastic found in marine animals (the actual problem plastic straw bans aim to address). I also like how you ignored the big fat \"oil profits\" that came before it, because conservatives most certainly value oil profit (and the fossil fuel industry in general) over actually addressing climate change. \n\nThe increase in co-morbidity with regards to weight and covid is with obesity. People putting on a few pounds is not a significant concern when it comes to increasing covid's morbidity, especially if the reason is something that drastically decreases case numbers. The vaccines helped regardless of whatever inflated statistics media companies may or may not have used (I have no idea what you're actually talking about here), and not getting them because they're not 100% effective is foolhardy. Masks, similarly, help tremendously, they're just not 100% effective. Herd Immunity couldn't be reached because conservatives refused to get the vaccine, so I'm not sure why you're trying to count that *against* the dems. Finally, no mandate made it illegal to not have a vaccine. Every mandate made it illegal to *do certain activities* without a vaccine, but none of them were required to live.\n\nThe issue with abortion is bodily autonomy. Every question is a philosophical question, but in this particular case we have settled this philosophical question in other parts of society. If someone is mid-blood transfusion or organ donation or any other procedure in which their body is being used to save someone else, they can stop at any time for any reason and it's not considered murder.\n\n[94%](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/party-affiliation/) of the Republican party is in some way religious. The remaining 6% vote for the nutjobs who write things like trans bathroom bans, trans military bans, or oppose gay marriage. The issue is absolutely not about harassing artists, but rather queer people's basic human rights and dignity being assaulted at every turn.\n\nYou'll be happy to know most of the posters on reddit are not actually sitting republican congresspeople, the people who do in fact legislate based on their religion. Abortion bans and (previously) gay marriage bans are two highly prominent examples of religious law making, but there are plenty of others (for example: not being able to buy alcohol on sundays).\n\nRacism is in fact a significantly larger problem than its typically made out to be. Proposed solutions (talking about how race informs someone's life, how systemic racism still affects minority communities, and actively working to break cycles of poverty and oppression) are liable to be effective if broadly embraced, and \"don't talk about your oppression and it might go away\" is not a strategy that works for anyone but the oppressors. You don't need to look any further than the right wing fervor about CRT, a college level theory, being \"taught\" in elementary schools (spoilers, literally never happened, not once, not ever.)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I get into this, friendly reminder that the democrats are a right wing party and America doesn&amp;#39;t actually have a left wing. Instead, they have a small group of &amp;quot;progressives&amp;quot; who exist within a right wing party and tend to be center-left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t want higher taxes, but they also oppose minimum wage increases, workplace safety, corporate regulation in general, tenant protection laws, and a host of other things that would make working class lives better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They also oppose public healthcare in other countries, even ones with better healthcare than America (notably Canada and the UK). They are often mocking or otherwise denigrating countries that have better implementation of healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They claimed that an election they lost was fraudulent without a shred of evidence of election fraud, and then when evidence &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; show up, the vast majority of it was &lt;em&gt;Republicans&lt;/em&gt; committing it. Compare that to the democrat version, who didn&amp;#39;t dispute the &lt;em&gt;veracity&lt;/em&gt; of the election (i.e. didn&amp;#39;t say the republicans cheated, broke the law, or anything), but instead disputed the &lt;em&gt;fairness of the electoral system&lt;/em&gt; (specifically, the fact that the president lost the popular vote but won the presidency).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like how for this one you talk about plastic straws as a ratio of plastics being used, and not as a ratio of plastic found in marine animals (the actual problem plastic straw bans aim to address). I also like how you ignored the big fat &amp;quot;oil profits&amp;quot; that came before it, because conservatives most certainly value oil profit (and the fossil fuel industry in general) over actually addressing climate change. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The increase in co-morbidity with regards to weight and covid is with obesity. People putting on a few pounds is not a significant concern when it comes to increasing covid&amp;#39;s morbidity, especially if the reason is something that drastically decreases case numbers. The vaccines helped regardless of whatever inflated statistics media companies may or may not have used (I have no idea what you&amp;#39;re actually talking about here), and not getting them because they&amp;#39;re not 100% effective is foolhardy. Masks, similarly, help tremendously, they&amp;#39;re just not 100% effective. Herd Immunity couldn&amp;#39;t be reached because conservatives refused to get the vaccine, so I&amp;#39;m not sure why you&amp;#39;re trying to count that &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the dems. Finally, no mandate made it illegal to not have a vaccine. Every mandate made it illegal to &lt;em&gt;do certain activities&lt;/em&gt; without a vaccine, but none of them were required to live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue with abortion is bodily autonomy. Every question is a philosophical question, but in this particular case we have settled this philosophical question in other parts of society. If someone is mid-blood transfusion or organ donation or any other procedure in which their body is being used to save someone else, they can stop at any time for any reason and it&amp;#39;s not considered murder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/party-affiliation/\"&gt;94%&lt;/a&gt; of the Republican party is in some way religious. The remaining 6% vote for the nutjobs who write things like trans bathroom bans, trans military bans, or oppose gay marriage. The issue is absolutely not about harassing artists, but rather queer people&amp;#39;s basic human rights and dignity being assaulted at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be happy to know most of the posters on reddit are not actually sitting republican congresspeople, the people who do in fact legislate based on their religion.
