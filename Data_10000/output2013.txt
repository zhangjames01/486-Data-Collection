If you leave stuff in a structure and it gets destroyed then that stuff will be transported to a nearby NPC station in the same security class.  This doesn't work in wormholes or if the structure is unpowered, but so long as you keep it powered it's a nice backup.\n\nBeyond that there are the services that a structure can be set up to provide.  The cidadels--Astrahus, Fortizar, and Keepstar--tend to be focused on providing things like clone bays and markets.  The engineering complexes--Raitaru, Azbel, and Sotiyo--specialize in offering science and industry.

When tethered a ship cannot be targeted or damaged, though they can be bumped.  This tends to make tether a very safe position for a ship to be in when preparing for an activity, whether that's a fleet about to dive into action or a jump freighter hopping across the universe.  Combined with the ability to fit a clone bay this makes structures an important part of an offensive push.  Note that structures have hard caps on how quickly they can be destroyed--their shields, armor, and hull hitpoints must be depleted in separate events, the latter two carrying a damage cap so a group can't just show up with insane DPS and blow through the hitpoints in 30 seconds before anyone can respond.  \n\nAs for what it takes to own one it's more practical to do it solo than this sub likes to suggest.

Having a structure will make you eligible for having a war declared against you and your corporation, but most of the time that's not worth the fees and effort for the attacker.\n\nMechanically, to launch a structure you need to be in a corporation where you have the rights to launch structures.  The easiest way to do this is to start your own, though of course Eve is better with friends.  From there you buy the structure on the market (or I suppose you could build it yourself, but that takes a ton of startup cash) and haul it somewhere where you'd like to anchor it (being sure not to do so in a T1 hauler--even the smallest structures are too expensive for such a squishy ship).  From there there's a UI where you position the structure; as a tip, try to point the exit in the direction you'll most often warp so you don't have to spend a long time aligning.  When you start anchoring there's a brief window where the structure could be shot at (but only by people at war with you, which will be nobody for the corporation's first structure), then 24 hours, then you need to install a quantum core (expensive item bought from NPCs) and the structure will finish coming online.  It's theoretically possible for someone to be quick enough at declaring a war against you that they can shoot at you and the structure during this final onlining time, but they have mere minutes to act so practically speaking the first structure gets to come online for free.\n\nOnce fully anchored you install service modules and load it up with fuel.

Alternatively, you can setup an athanor in some 0.5 system mining a moon; people will come by and mine the rocks, but as a solo player you can't really mine it all yourself anyway (probably).

Naturally you have quite a bit more mass than the bullet so you won't wind up going anywhere close to the speed of a bullet.  Let's say you wind up going 5 cm/s after the first shot.  If you fire again you'd wind up at about 10 cm/s, then the third takes you to 15 cm/s.\n\nThis would seem to allow you to get up to whatever speed you want--just fire more bullets!  You get back in your spaceship and load your pockets with all the bullets you can find and go back out the airlock.  You fire your gun again and now find that with all the bullets you loaded yourself down with you now have quite a bit more mass.  Perhaps now you only go 2 cm/s after the first shot.  As you keep working through your ammo you get lighter and lighter, eventually getting back to the 5 cm/s you had when you first tried.\n\nThis may seem like a ludicrous example, but it's very closely adjacent to how rockets work.  Instead of \"firing a gun\" they fire their rockets, but the result is the same.  Fire the rocket for twice as long and you go *roughly* twice as fast, but as the burn gets longer and longer you start to have to care about the changes to the mass of the rocket as you deplete your fuel (or ammo, for the gun example).  Getting up to a higher speed takes more fuel, but more fuel is more mass and more mass takes more impulse (thrust \\* time) to accelerate.\n\nThis feedback loop is often referred to as \"The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation.\"  It's why rockets grow to such ludicrous sizes--getting a payload up to a little bit higher speed takes an enormous increase in fuel.  There's no way around the rocket equation, but there is a way to temper its effect.  Turning back to the gun example we can see that firing a bullet at about 400 m/s (e.g. from a handgun) will not give as much kick as firing that same bullet at 1000 m/s (e.g. from a rifle).  If we want to optimize for the amount of kick we get per bullet we should fire at the highest possible muzzle velocity (aside: in this analogy I've ignored a lot of complexities like the mass of the casing, the thrust of the gasses coming out of the barrel, etc).  The same idea is true of rockets:  the higher the velocity that the gasses come out of the nozzle the higher the speed that rocket can take you to, starting at rest in a vacuum.  For some silly reasons we typically express this quantity after first dividing by 9.8 m/s^(2) so this \"exhaust speed\" winds up being described in units of seconds, but this efficiency, known as \"specific impulse,\" is key to keeping the size of a rocket down.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It stacks up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially this will seem to be just addition.  Naturally you have quite a bit more mass than the bullet so you won&amp;#39;t wind up going anywhere close to the speed of a bullet.  Let&amp;#39;s say you wind up going 5 cm/s after the first shot.  If you fire again you&amp;#39;d wind up at about 10 cm/s, then the third takes you to 15 cm/s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would seem to allow you to get up to whatever speed you want--just fire more bullets!  You get back in your spaceship and load your pockets with all the bullets you can find and go back out the airlock.  You fire your gun again and now find that with all the bullets you loaded yourself down with you now have quite a bit more mass.  Perhaps now you only go 2 cm/s after the first shot.  As you keep working through your ammo you get lighter and lighter, eventually getting back to the 5 cm/s you had when you first tried.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a ludicrous example, but it&amp;#39;s very closely adjacent to how rockets work.  Instead of &amp;quot;firing a gun&amp;quot; they fire their rockets, but the result is the same.  Fire the rocket for twice as long and you go &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt; twice as fast, but as the burn gets longer and longer you start to have to care about the changes to the mass of the rocket as you deplete your fuel (or ammo, for the gun example).  Getting up to a higher speed takes more fuel, but more fuel is more mass and more mass takes more impulse (thrust * time) to accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This feedback loop is often referred to as &amp;quot;The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation.&amp;quot;  It&amp;#39;s why rockets grow to such ludicrous sizes--getting a payload up to a little bit higher speed takes an enormous increase in fuel.  There&amp;#39;s no way around the rocket equation, but there is a way to temper its effect.

Intercalary months varied wildly in length.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To fix that hole two new months were added.  Not July and August, but January and February.  These were initially tacked on at the end of the year and February, as the last month, got stuck with filling in the gaps just as the intercalary month had done before it.  This is why it&amp;#39;s the month that changes length in leap years and the one that has a weird number of days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over time the decision of whether January and February are the last months of the old year or the first months of the new year got muddied.  We wound up with them at the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Separately, the months Quintilis and Sextilis got renamed to July and August, but nothing was added except &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; making them both be 31 day months to not short change the months named for the rulers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10tgfeh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/HolUp/comments/10tgfeh/he_got_our_back/j79evhn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HolUp/comments/10tgfeh/he_got_our_back/", "name": "t1_j79evhn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HolUp", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675563464.0, "created_utc": 1675563464.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/b0t46wnqb6ga1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2th52", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Financial crisis part 2.0", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "wallstreetbets", "link_author": "Adorable_Island6277", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6vnp22", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Koooooj", "num_comments": 3517, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j6sx1cm", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_977t1", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Got it, buy houses in a saturated market and then sell them in one with low availability.

This is a fun way to spark deep philosophical conversations about whether randomness is even real or quantifiable.  Most of the time you don't need \"real\" randomness and can live with fast approximations of random distributions, like the linear congruential generators found in most language's random library.  These generators are extremely simple, consisting of an internal state that is multiplied by one constant and then added to another in each step, outputting part of the resulting state.  They will inevitably repeat their output, which is something we can take advantage of.  What if instead of outputting just part of the state we had the RNG output the entire state, and what if we arranged for the period of the output to be the same as the number of pixels?  This way we could just pull the first N \\* percentage numbers off the RNG and those are the points, with a mathematical guarantee that these pseudorandom numbers don't contain repetition.\n\nThere are a few ways to do this; I'll present one here.  This will be a Lehmer random number generator, which is a special case of a linear congruential generator where the addition term is 0.  To get started we turn to modular arithmetic and the notion of [primitive roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n).  The idea here is that we select some modulus and find a value *R* such that the sequence R^1 (mod M), R^(2) (mod M), R^(3) (mod M), ... R^(M-1) (mod M) touches every value from 1 to (M - 1), inclusive, except for those that share a factor with M.  This sequence will be in an order that feels quite random to someone who isn't looking for it (though just how hard they have to look will vary with selection of parameters).\n\nTo use this fact you have three main steps to accomplish:\n\n1. Select a number to be used as the modulus\n\n2. Find a primitive root of that modulus\n\n3. Use the resulting integer sequence to select pixels.\n\nSteps 1 and 2 could be done ahead of time if you're OK with some amount of predictability, but you could do them at runtime if you prefer.\n\nStep 1 is tricky because not all numbers even *have* a primitive root.  Outside of the first couple of trivial cases all numbers that have primitive roots are either a power of a single prime number or twice a power of a single prime number.  That is to say they can be written as either P^k or 2\\*P^k where P is a prime number and k is an integer.  The simplest approach here would be to just pick a prime number, but that's not necessarily the easiest thing.  Fermat's little theorem would get the job done if not for Fermat Liars.  If you have a favorite way to find true primes around a target number then use that, but in lieu of that what I would propose instead is to compose a number as a power of a relatively small prime.  I would propose:\n\n1. Take the number of pixels, length \\* width, to be N.\n\n2. Randomly select a prime number, P, from a hard-coded list of small primes, excluding 2.  You'll want this list to be pretty small, probably [3, 5, 7] or even just hard code P = 3.\n\n3. Successively raise P to higher and higher powers until the result, M, satisfies M - M/P &gt;= N.  We'll get some efficiency later if M - M/P is close to N.\n\nOnce we have the modulus the next step will be to find a primitive root.  The brute force approach here would defeat the whole purpose of this algorithm, so we instead turn again to math.  We know that once we've selected a value, R, to be raised to successively higher powers mod M we'll get a sequence of numbers that has to repeat.  The period of that repetition turns out to always be a factor of phi(M), where phi is Euler's totient function.  I'll denote T = phi(M).  Our procedure thus becomes:\n\n1. Compute T = M - M/P, a handy equivalence that comes from the fact that M has only one unique prime factor.\n\n2. Find the unique prime factors of T.  Note that with some clever algebra we can find that T is equal to (P - 1) \\* P^(k - 1) so the prime factors of T are just P and the prime factors of P - 1, so we don't have to be worried about any big trial division step here.  Let these factors be denoted as F.\n\n3. For each prime factor in F, compute M/F.  This will give you a list of exponents, E.\n\n4. Search for primitive roots by setting R = 2, 3, 4, 5, .... (but skipping P and perfect squares) and computing R^E (mod M) for each exponent in E.  If you find *any* E such that R^E \u2261 1 (mod M) then R is not a primitive root; continue on to the next one.  Once you find a value of R such that R^(E) \u22621 (mod M) for all values in E you have a primitive root.\n\nFinally we get to actually start generating our list of numbers without repetitions.  Here we have a few things to account for.  The most annoying is that this generator will skip all outputs that are a multiple of P, so we need to contract the range slightly to account for that.  We're also going to generate numbers on too large of a range, so we'll have to discard some outputs (we can NOT just modulo those into range--that would cause duplicates!).  Finally, while the sequence will look pretty random for most of its range it always starts at a small value and has a fairly predictable pattern for small values.  To address these problems we can:\n\n1. Select an exponent offset, A, randomly on the range [0, T) and a pixel offset, B, randomly on the range [0, N).\n\n2. Generate random numbers as C = R^(Z + A) (mod M) where Z is an incrementing integer.  Note:  Only compute the first value of C using the \"fast modular exponentiation\" function; subsequent values may be found with just a multiplication and a modulo operation.  This avoids putting an O(Log(N)) mod-pow inside of an O(N) loop.  We can also skip computing the first value of C and instead just select it randomly on the range [0, M) *but* if we pick a number divisible by P then we need to pick again.  This is the seed for the RNG.\n\n3. Fix the skipping of multiples of P by taking D = C  - C / P (integer division).  The values of D will visit every value on (0, T] as Z ranges from [0, T).  Note that this range skips 0, but a later modulo will fix that.  Also, if we had selected M as a prime in the first phase we could skip this step entirely.\n\n4. If D is greater than N, skip it and move to the next value of Z.\n\n3. From D, compute G = D + B (mod N).  This just shifts the pixel constellation by the offset we picked in step 1 of this phase.  This isn't strictly needed, but since building your own RNG is fraught with pitfalls it can't hurt to add a bit more noise to the system.\n\n4. Finally, resolve G into coordinates as X = G / length (integer division) and Y = G % length.\n\nIf I've done my Big O correctly then the modulus search will run in O(log(N)), the primitive root search has an abysmal worst case but typically will take about half a dozen log(N) mod-pow operations, and the generating of random numbers will run in O(N\\*percentage) (i.e. linear in the number of pixels you actually pick, not the number that exist in total).  \n\n********\n\nTo give an example of the third strategy, if your images are 2560x1440 then N = 3,686,400.  I select 7 as a small prime and find that M = 7^8 = 5,764,801.  This gives T = 4,941,258, the unique prime factors of which are 2, 3, and 7.  This gives E = [2470629, 1647086, 705894].\n\nFrom here I check 2^2470629 mod 5764801 and get 1, so 2 is not a primitive root.  I check 3^2470629 mod 5764801 and get 5764800 (i.e. not 1), so I check 3^(1647086) mod 5764801 and get 2387947 (not 1), so I check 3^705894 mod 5764801 and get 4941259 (not 1).  This has passed for all values in E, so 3 is a primitive root.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite--though not necessarily the best--solution is to ask how much you actually care about the points being &amp;quot;truly&amp;quot; random.

Also, if we had selected M as a prime in the first phase we could skip this step entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If D is greater than N, skip it and move to the next value of Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From D, compute G = D + B (mod N).  This just shifts the pixel constellation by the offset we picked in step 1 of this phase.  This isn&amp;#39;t strictly needed, but since building your own RNG is fraught with pitfalls it can&amp;#39;t hurt to add a bit more noise to the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, resolve G into coordinates as X = G / length (integer division) and Y = G % length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;ve done my Big O correctly then the modulus search will run in O(log(N)), the primitive root search has an abysmal worst case but typically will take about half a dozen log(N) mod-pow operations, and the generating of random numbers will run in O(N*percentage) (i.e. linear in the number of pixels you actually pick, not the number that exist in total).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To give an example of the third strategy, if your images are 2560x1440 then N = 3,686,400.  I select 7 as a small prime and find that M = 7&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 5,764,801.  This gives T = 4,941,258, the unique prime factors of which are 2, 3, and 7.  This gives E = [2470629, 1647086, 705894].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From here I check 2&lt;sup&gt;2470629&lt;/sup&gt; mod 5764801 and get 1, so 2 is not a primitive root.  I check 3&lt;sup&gt;2470629&lt;/sup&gt; mod 5764801 and get 5764800 (i.e. not 1), so I check 3&lt;sup&gt;1647086&lt;/sup&gt; mod 5764801 and get 2387947 (not 1), so I check 3&lt;sup&gt;705894&lt;/sup&gt; mod 5764801 and get 4941259 (not 1).  This has passed for all values in E, so 3 is a primitive root.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10o9z7e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskProgramming/comments/10o9z7e/efficient_randomization/j6h1g0t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/10o9z7e/efficient_randomization/", "name": "t1_j6h1g0t", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskProgramming", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675061693.0, "created_utc": 1675061693.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/10o9z7e/efficient_randomization/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2seko", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Efficient randomization?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskProgramming", "link_author": "Zyper0", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j6h1fqq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Koooooj", "num_comments": 11, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10o9z7e", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_977t1", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; for higher percentages I imagine this is very ineffective\n\nCareful with the imagination there.  The typical advice is \"beware premature optimization.\"  There's a lot of fun stuff you can do trying to optimize this problem, but unless you're sure that this is actually a bottleneck there's a good chance you're wasting your time turning a 100 microsecond operation into an 80 microsecond operation (or even making it slower).\n\nI would expect that the trivial solution you describe would probably run at a perfectly acceptable speed, even on the most modest of hardware.
