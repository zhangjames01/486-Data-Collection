I have an amazing husband who loves me the way I am and I don&amp;#39;t have to live up to anyones standards except my own!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she really didn&amp;#39;t care then she&amp;#39;d post pictures of herself with no make-up, unstyled hair, clothes that show all of her flaws (a bikini that covers that much isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;showing your flaws&amp;quot;!!) and she wouldn&amp;#39;t photoshop any of it! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She isn&amp;#39;t going against beauty standards, she&amp;#39;s just warping them slightly to fit her body type. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck you, Tess! If you were really trying to change things then you&amp;#39;d be trying to make it so that girls like me that can never in a billion years meet society&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;beauty standards&amp;quot; would be accepted. Instead you&amp;#39;re just trying to make your size part of the current ideal!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_32bwow", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/fatlogic/comments/32bwow/who_is_she_trying_to_convince/cqaea62/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fatlogic/comments/32bwow/who_is_she_trying_to_convince/", "name": "t1_cqaea62", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1428890382.0, "created_utc": 1428890382.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://imgur.com/eek1W78"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2to41", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "TIFU by getting chlorine poisoning on my penis.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "tifu", "link_author": "letsgoblkhawks", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cqaai7k", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "BendyZebra", "num_comments": 45, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cqaadiy", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_aok0n", "over_18": true, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Take care, lovely!
