If you give them your honest opinion instead of your filtered one, they will play up the idea that they are hurt by it. It's emotionally manipulative.\n\nBy all means, you should never volunteer an opinion or judgement that is hurtful unless it is absolutely necessary, even then stay strictly within the information that is necessary to communicate. That *would* make you an AH.\n\nHowever, I see asking for an opinion without respecting the other person's ability to be completely honest with it as a common form of AH behaviour.\n\nAs a life rule of thumb though, if you ever feel like you need to or want to deliver a negative opinion to someone, think of something nice to say first to soften the blow, and then quickly patch it up with another nice thing.
