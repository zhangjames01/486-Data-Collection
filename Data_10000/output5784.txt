This is a long post, I apologize and hope it's okay. The question is at the bottom.\n\nI have a dog tested and confirmed to have color dilution alopecia, a condition that I've read is a result of a genetic mutation. CDA happens to dogs that are \"rare\" color variations in particular breeds - blue chihuahuas, blue dobermans, silver labs, for example. These are gray dogs in breeds where gray doesn't usually exist, they are basically diluted black. CDA causes most (but frequently all) of their gray hair to fall out while they are still young (usually by around 2), leaving them permanently bald in those areas. And only the gray hair- if they have other standard colors on them (like white or brown or fawn in chihuahuas) then it's usually normal. The skin in those \"blue\" or \"silver\" areas is usually gray as well, and the skin is thin and soft and the pores are clogged and prone to irritation. Very few will grow some hair back but most won't. It is a condition that is mostly aesthetic except for of course the protection fur provides to a dog.\n\nMy dog was mostly bald, almost all his fur fell out in the course of a year. He's two years old and healthy otherwise. I did a lot of research online and through my vet and I found only three instances where people treated their dog's CDA with melatonin. One was a very sciencey type study by a vet that didn't result in any regrowth. The other was a guy who thoroughly documented his routine but didn't say if it worked out not. One was a Facebook group for a woman who was able to regrow her dog's fur using a combination of melatonin, vitamins A/D/E, and apple cider vinegar. She's the only person I found whose dog had regrowth. \n\nI'm a skeptical person but I decided to try it because it didn't seem to hurt the dogs. I didn't expect it to work but I'll be damned if my dog didn't regrow a TON of fur in just two months! He started growing fur within a week of giving him melatonin. He has more fur now than he's ever had and it is still growing, coming back in where he was totally hairless and smooth even for a long time. I have no science background but I know enough to know that there are too many variables to prove the melatonin worked, but I'm wondering if there is a small possibility that it did make his fur grow back (this is not my question). The hair quality is totally different too; previously if he had any fur, you could gently pull it and it would come out with zero resistance. The hair would break easily and be all clumpy and gross near the roots. This new hair doesn't come out even if I give it a good tug. It doesn't break as easily either. It's still much softer than normal long-haired chihuahua fur but it's better than what he used to have. My vet was really shocked and said he'd never seen anything like it. \n\nSorry for the long long backstory but I didn't think CDA was something a lot of people knew about. Obviously there's no way to prove from my one non-scientific-method test that the melatonin worked, but here is my question based off an idea I had if I went with the idea that the melatonin worked:\n\nI read that melatonin aids in the production of melanin, which is what controls skin pigment I think. Since \"blue\" color variations in this breed of dog are rare, could it be that he is gray because he doesn't have enough melanin to be fully black? If so, could that translate to skin and his fur conditions being poor, causing the breakage and clogging that made his fur fall out? Could giving him melatonin in some way help improve his skin quality in the areas where he has that gray skin as a result?\n\nI'm not claiming the melatonin worked because I know there are other things that could have caused this. I'm just curious IF it worked, could this be part of the reason? Again I have no science or medical background so I'm sorry if everything I wrote sounds stupid.
