As soon as they experience ice for the first time they won't be able to turn at all. As soon as they get into breakable crust or soft snow they sink to the bottom, catch tips and fall.\n\nTeaching wedge turns by weighting the outside ski is a new instructor's mistake. Weighting the outside foot can make whatever turn they're already doing better by using more ski design to round the turn, but it does not produce the turn and it does not change the turn type alone. If you can ski in a straight line on a single leg, you have proved that even with maximum weight on just one leg it does not necessarily mean you will turn. \n\nInstead, teach rotary. In order to produce the wedge the student is rotating both legs in the hip socket. Teach them to widen one leg's wedge, and shrink the other. The student's direction will change, and you'll see a turn develop. Swap which leg widens/ shrinks, you turn the other way.\n\nThe rotation method produces a turn because when you're weighting both legs somewhat equally you will go where the wedge points, and that's no longer straight down the hill.\n\nYou can teach this by encouraging outside leg rotation, inside leg rotation, pointing the wedge itself, or whatever metaphor.\n\nAlso, congrats you've introduced upper/lower body separation. If they expand on these skills they'll be much better off in the long run.\n\nI train every one of my instructors to avoid teaching edging and pressure until wedge christies start to occur.

As soon as they experience ice for the first time they won&amp;#39;t be able to turn at all. As soon as they get into breakable crust or soft snow they sink to the bottom, catch tips and fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teaching wedge turns by weighting the outside ski is a new instructor&amp;#39;s mistake. Weighting the outside foot can make whatever turn they&amp;#39;re already doing better by using more ski design to round the turn, but it does not produce the turn and it does not change the turn type alone. If you can ski in a straight line on a single leg, you have proved that even with maximum weight on just one leg it does not necessarily mean you will turn. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, teach rotary. In order to produce the wedge the student is rotating both legs in the hip socket. Teach them to widen one leg&amp;#39;s wedge, and shrink the other. The student&amp;#39;s direction will change, and you&amp;#39;ll see a turn develop.
