I wish you would stop doing that.

But that isn't really what's happening. SD61 currently has the highest Indigenous graduation rates it's ever seen; that's largely because of the work of the Aboriginal Nations Education Department, which has been working within the district to adjust curriculum to more accurately reflect the truth of the past and present for 30+ years. The fruits of their labour are just starting to show.\n\nThe truth is painful, but it sets people free. Pretending Canada has fewer issues than it really does may be comfortable in the immediate, but it keep us in bondage in the long-term.\n\n&gt;In fact, my family fled their country and moved to another place to make their own way.\n\nI hear you. So did my family. Both sides. My Ojibwe family fled our territory to BC. They did this to hide their kids in the bush, to save them from Residential School and Catholic conversion. My Polish family fled Europe shortly before WWII, because we have Jewish ancestry.\n\nEven then... My Polish-Canadian grandfather was afforded more privileges than my Ojibwe grandfather based solely on not being an Indian. Polish grandpa was allowed to freely vote, freely hire an attorney, freely attend university, freely practice his trade. He got veterans benefits right after the war. None of those privileges were afforded to my Ojibwe grandpa until 1960 and the late 1970s. (And, if he were still alive, he still wouldn't be able to practice our family's trapping trade. Though that may change with some treaty settlements happening soon.)\n\n&gt;finding more people to blame\n\nIt is not about blame. It is about being responsible in the present day.\n\nDo I \"blame\" my Polish grandfather for the privileges he had over my Ojibwe grandpa? No. But I acknowledge it. I acknowledge fully that Polish grandpa had a much greater opportunity to set up himself and his family for success than my Ojibwe grandpa did. I acknowledge that both of their lives deeply impact my life. I'm better off than a lot of native people in my generation, and part of that is because I have a bunch of non-native family who had way more privilege to pass on than my native family did.\n\nAnd because of that inherited privilege, I have a responsibility. A civic duty. I need to help uplift those held down by historical and present oppressions. If I want Canada to ever live up to its espoused values of equality, multiculturalism, and freedom, I have to actually work to make Canada better.

I have not accused anyone of being evil or bad. You are projecting that onto me.\n\nI think this stuff is worth discussing and considering and I was trying to have a respectful dialogue with you, but apparently that didn't translate so well.\n\nEdit: Since you're concerned I won't respond to your points... here:\n\n&gt;videos you see online about police violence is less than 0.01% of the cop population.\n\nI'm not just concerned about outright police brutality. I am concerned about the criminalization of poverty, which is a increasingly severe problem as housing becomes completely unaffordable in metropolitan areas of this province.\n\nI am concerned about the continued punishment of sex workers, when we could be protecting the workers and Johns a lot better if we didn't have outdated legislation regarding sex works. Cops are the ones enforcing these laws.\n\nI am concerned about police negligence regarding sexual assault and online harassing, which disproportionately affects LGBTQ+ people.\n\nPolice killings and violent beatings may be relatively rare -- and those instances are always unacceptable -- but that's far from my only beef with the police.\n\n&gt;Not everyone thinks trans people are mentally stable, and that's their opinion\n\nThat may be their opinion, sure. I tend to trust psychology and medicine on this topic. Those fields have determined that gender dysphoria can exacerbate anxiety, depression and other forms of mental illness. Those fields are aware that trans identities themselves are not a mental instability, rather it is the body-mind disconnect of gender dysphoria that creates so many issues. The continued experience of mental health issues commonly experienced by post-transition transfolk can be linked to the lack of acceptance and inequities faced by trans people in mainstream society.\n\nNot everyone thinks climate change is man made. That's their opinion. Science disagrees. I'm gonna trust the experts, not rando culture critic on the street.\n\n&gt; You honestly can't ask for teachers to specifically teach that you should treat trans people nice, it's apart of the overall sentiment. \n\nNotice how I said \"acknowledge\" first when I talked about education and trans people? I'm in my 30s. When we were kids, we didn't learn much about gender identity or even gay/bi identities. Now that's partially because of ignorance and it wasn't an act of evil by any of my teachers. But we know more than we did in the 90s now, and curriculum is changing to reflect that.\n\nSchool *absolutely* includes moral and ethical teaching alongside reading, writing and arithmetic.\n\nSome ethical and social issues I remember being heavily discussed in school included:\n\n* Not mocking people with disabilities\n\n* Not mocking people based on their skin colour\n\n* Not littering or destroying nature\n\n* Respecting the military (I grew up in a base town)\n\n* Not mocking people for their religion/lack of religion\n\nSo yeah. It's pretty reasonable IMO to include some curriculum where the existence of trans and queer people is discussed. As society grows to be more knowledgeable and equitable, our schooling must grow alongside it.\n\n&gt;You say you want equality for all yet you guys are in your own bubble rejecting everyone who doesn't agree.\n\nAgain you're *really* projecting a lot of your own complaints with LGBTQ+ activism on me. I didn't \"reject\" you. I didn't even \"reject\" cops really. I criticized the issues they continue to perpetuate, and you *can* criticize institutions without outright rejecting them as having any use in society.\n\nAll I've done in this thread is ask people to consider the argument of anti-cop people sincerely. I haven't asked anyone to even change their mind. \"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.\"\n\nIf you think all queer and trans activists are some kind of monolith hivemind who agree with each other on everything dogmatically... you probably haven't spent too much time among them.", "edited": 1533520124.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t call you a transphobe or a bigot, and you&amp;#39;re the one who compared cops to trans folk in the comment I just replied to. :/ I was trying to answer a question &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; posited about what the difference between excluding a state institution and a group of marginalized individuals was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you read my other comments on this thread, you&amp;#39;d see that I actually am open to discussion and I haven&amp;#39;t made up my mind 100% what is the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; answer to this issue.
