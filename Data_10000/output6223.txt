There are a few main issues I'm seeing:\n\n* The game does have stutters, but they are either very infrequent or pretty brief. Once you are playing a level for more than a few minutes the stutters all but go away.\n* The game has a serious \"white random flashing\" issue related to some graphical effects. The whole screen just kind of flashes.\n* HDR is disappointing. It's basically \"SDR -&gt; HDR\" style HDR where everything feels like it's tone mapped and not actually taking advantage of dynamic range. You can help alleviate this by setting the \"contrast\" slider up a couple notches, which lowers the overall black level or so it seems without decreasing the entire image. Setting it to 10 is a bit extreme so I've got mine on 7 or 8 which has some nice highlights but it still suffers from a constantly shifting dynamic range threshold, where the bright lights will dim or brighten further depending on where your character is instead of being more realistic.\n* I can't seem to get 120hz mode on the game pass version. Not sure why. Maybe it's something with my system settings or what, but I've been playing at \\~60fps (despite having a limiter it occasionally goes over) and it runs smooth as butter when it doesn't stutter, which again is quite rare for me.\n\nIn addition there are a couple weird things with launch:\n\n* The game didn't respect my preload and had me redownload the entire game on launch. Not a big deal for me since I have gigabit internet but if you don't have it, that must have sucked.\n* The default buttons were set to PlayStation format which is weird because I use an XInput controller and I'm playing a PC game. Will probably be fixed but either way it's no big deal as you can fix it yourself.\n* Once the game didn't launch. Launching it again worked. Weird.\n\nThere is a workaround to the \"white flashes\" issue btw, which is to turn off ambient occlusion. It gets rid of most of them in normal gameplay it but can still appear when in menus while you're resting.\n\nOverall I wouldn't say it's a great port or anything but I'm finding it mostly playable. If they can fix that white flashing issue and maybe help precompile some shaders (though again, this is not nearly as bad as other games by a wide margin) it should be good enough for me.\n\nSpecs:\n\n* Win 11\n* 16gb DDR4 RAM\n* Intel i3 13600k\n* NVidia RTX 4090\n\nAnd before anyone says \"of course it runs well, you have a good rig\", you should understand that there have been several games released over the past 4-5 months that have terrible stuttering issues and other things that even a rig of this caliber can't handle. So it's not to say the game is totally optimized, because I don't know that for sure, but it doesn't have any game-breaking issues (EDIT: seems some people are experiencing crashes, which is unfortunate, but it could be for a wide variety of reasons so the jury is still out on that.
