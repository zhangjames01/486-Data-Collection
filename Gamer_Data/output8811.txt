COD is the only exception as it offers a F2P mode. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Siege, Hunt, and destiny 2 are successful with it and are cosmetic only. Although each never started out with a battle pass or seasons. They were incorporated into the game at later points and eventually the community &amp;quot;adpoted&amp;quot; the idea of battle passes. Problem is, they&amp;#39;re now becoming staples of AAA games and why should they?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s still a paywall behind objects whether their cosmetic or not. If you want to release a DLC with all the items in it and also add content, I have no problem with buying and supporting the game. What I have a problem with is every 3 months, they&amp;#39;re going to ask you for $20 for this pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s add that up... so for a base game at $70, you&amp;#39;ll be paying an additional $80 on top (granted, if you choose) for a grand total of $140 for the game. Who in their right mind would pay double for a game that was created to pay wall certain cosmetics? It&amp;#39;s not like the first year all of these are accessible and then they decided to add additional content. Theyre literally trying to hook people into paying more than double for a game... that&amp;#39;s my problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, I know you&amp;#39;ll say, &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t have to buy it&amp;quot; and you&amp;#39;re right, I don&amp;#39;t. What I have a problem with is adding content behind a paywall when a game is first released. Also the predatory nature of a battle pass. It&amp;#39;s ridiculous at very least.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zhy51f", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Diablo/comments/zhy51f/full_details_on_battle_pass_for_d4/izpf4pc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/zhy51f/full_details_on_battle_pass_for_d4/", "name": "t1_izpf4pc", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Diablo", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1670706985.0, "created_utc": 1670706985.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/zhy51f/full_details_on_battle_pass_for_d4/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2va9w", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "mommy you wouldn't use me for clout would you?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 6, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "cringepics", "link_author": "Fearless-Purpose-133", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "izoiu9r", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "bizN", "num_comments": 350, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_izogxnc", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_6c5py", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Every mother has done something that their child or others will think is cringe.
