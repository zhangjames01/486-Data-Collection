I think I just got lucky on the last run and it actually did a chain of 22 or something which capped&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is max damage on every attack, but attacks have a base maximum damage of 9.99 billion that is then proportioned based on the attacks weighting across hits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s use an example of a backloaded attack that deals 50% of its damage on the final hit and then evenly distributes the other 50% across 8.  That would mean 5 B damage  on final hit and 625 M damage on the other 8 hits. Then you multiply the chain bonus against them, but no single hit can do more than 9.99 B damage so that turns into 8 hits of 3.75 B and 1 hit of 9.99 B for a total damage of ~40 B instead of roughly 90 billion if each hit could deal 9.99 B damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope that made sense and was helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11knk6r", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/11knk6r/rank_1_dark_visions/jbbkzmd/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/11knk6r/rank_1_dark_visions/", "name": "t1_jbbkzmd", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/FFBraveExvius", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678224678.0, "created_utc": 1678224678.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FFBraveExvius/comments/11knk6r/rank_1_dark_visions/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34n2x", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Rank 1 Dark Visions", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "FFBraveExvius", "link_author": "FlipMethod", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbbhfi0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "liquld", "num_comments": 317, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jban6oz", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_55rpc", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;You can encounter this by just normally playing the game.
