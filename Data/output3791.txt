Here's what I have (and have done) to my standard tele:\n\nFirst mod was the stewmac freeway switch (4 way toggle) which gave me a 4th option of the bridge and neck in series.\n\nSecond mod was a push/pull on the volume to reverse the phase of the neck PU.\n\nThird mod was adding a middle pickup (all pickups are traditional single coils). Added push/pull to tone to turn this pickup on and off.\n\nSo, what I have as switching options are:\n\n1. all standard 2 pickup tele options\n2. addition of neck and bridge in series\n3. addition of neck and bridge out of phase (either in series or parallel)\n4. middle pickup can be combined with either the neck, bridge, or both in parallel.\n5. middle pickup can be combined with neck AND bridge with them in series but the middle added in parallel.\n6. all of the above options with the neck pickup reversed in phase.\n\nThe one major thing missing is middle by itself. I have 3 strats and a jag with 3 pickups and I rarely use the middle by itself so this isn't a major loss but it is a drawback as I'm always trying to get every last ounce of wiring options from every guitar I have. I have considered an alternative wiring of the middle pickup that bypasses the volume so when the push/pull is raised, it's always at full volume. I could then use the vol to turn off the other two PUs. The trade off of NOT being able to control the middle PU volume has steered me away from this because I'm a player that relies heavily upon vol and tone controls on most of my guitars. If you're the type that always has them at 10, then this would be a more feasible option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main strat has 3 fender noiseless PU's and I have two options on it. I replaced the second tone control with a blend pot that blends in the neck PU when the selector switch is in position 4 or 5 (bridge+middle or bridge). So this gave me N+B or all three on at the same time... but this is all in parallel.\n\nI then went to a Musicians Friend sponsored Fender workshop/show and tell thing with one of Fender's master builders. I told him about my strat's wiring and asked if he could think of anything else I could do to add even more options. He suggested a Push/pull in place of the remaining tone control that would add the neck PU in series when in position 4 or 5 on the selector. So I did that too.\n\nSo my options added to the standard 5 way wiring of a strat are:\n\n1. blend in neck in parallel when in position 4 or 5\n2. switch on neck in series when in position 4 or 5\n\nI did a similar thing with my jag but it only had one vol and one tone. It's also an HSS. The vol p/p puts the bridge humbucker in parallel mode (for single like tones while still hum cancelling) and  tone p/p adds the bridge PU when in positions 1 or 2 of the selector switch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, nothing exactly what you asked for... but based on my wiring of my 3 PU guitars, these are the options I've found to be pretty damn useful.

It uses the toggle switch your guitar is using and the middle position has the pickups wired in series.\n\nI looked for a TW61 wiring diagram and struck out so I'll have to assume it follows the same idea from this schematic. If you remember the way yours was wired originally or if you took a picture of it, let me know.\n\nI \\*think\\* this will work... but whenever there aren't tons of wiring diagrams floating around on the internet, it makes me skeptical.\n\nThe wiring diagram linked above is for single coils and obviously, yours has humbuckers. The black wires in this diagram (coming from the pickups) are the equivalent of your green wires. The other wire coming from this schematic equals your red wire. The black/white wires from your pickups stay wired the way you have them now (to be controlled by the push pulls).\n\nIf you follow the diagram to hook up the non-black/white wires, you should have it working as you hope. My doubt comes from this; and I'm typing through this more to work out in my head if it's possible... Series wiring has the signal going from one pickup through all the wire in the other pickup. One side is the hot, the other is the ground, so it acts like it's one huge 4 coil humbucker. Now, if you shunt the black/whites to ground (pull up on one of the push/pulls), is the signal still going to make it from one end to the other? Thinking about it makes my head start to hurt. I'm no expert on this stuff and mainly just follow schematics.\n\nSo... you can keep your push/pulls wired as is and follow the schematic above. I'm fairly positive that will work when the coils are not split. When you split one or both... I'm less sure.\n\nOr... you can get something like this and just replace the existing switch and keep all your wiring as is:\n\n[https://smile.amazon.com/Straight-Guitar-Selector-Epiphone-Electric/dp/B07FNHDFHB/](https://smile.amazon.com/Straight-Guitar-Selector-Epiphone-Electric/dp/B07FNHDFHB/)", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.tdpri.com/threads/series-wiring-on-cv-duo-sonic.574857/\"&gt;https://www.tdpri.com/threads/series-wiring-on-cv-duo-sonic.574857/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a schematic on this page that seems to be using the same idea as my danelectro (this is for the fender duo sonic).
