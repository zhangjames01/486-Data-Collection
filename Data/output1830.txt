Really. Your thought process sounds so much like how mine used to be. I really feel for you where you're at right now. It's literally like mental torture and I know because I've been there too. \n\n&gt;1 girl a month pops up who is a \u2018unicorn\u2019 like my ex, and even when they do, they don\u2019t end up matching with me. I\u2019m trying but more and more it just feels like I captured lightning in a bottle and it\u2019ll never happen again\n\nThis was very much my experience too...\n\nI was so beat down from infrequent matches, and even the ones I got were never that great... I was having to do a lot of \"Well, maybe she's cool/more attractive in person\" rationalizing etc.\n\n So when I found my current partner, I was THIS close to not swiping right on her... And why? Because I thought to myself: \"Eh, she'd never go for me... She seems wholesome and like she has a great life, she's beautiful, fit, highly intelligent, witty, cute, great job, etc. She would never want some overweight underemployed depressed bald divorced single dad who vapes and drinks a little too much\"  \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut thank god I decided to just chance it anyway (I actually wrote her a message, this was OKCupid of all apps).\n\nShe didn't even read the message until a month after I sent it. And when she responded it was to say \"Oh I really like your profile but UGH we're so far away and I swore I wouldn't do long distance anymore\" (it's manageable for us for right now 1.5 hours away).  But, we chatted and it went well and so she made the exception and suggested hey maybe we should just meet anyway just in case we really hit it off. \n\nLater she explained she had just about had it with dating and had gone on a bad date from OkC just the week before and she was taking one last look when she saw my message. \n\nAnd, luckily, we had instant, solid rapport. Not lovebomby over sharing, just ... Solid. Fun. Comfortable. \n\nDefinitely a sense of \"just making it under the wire\", just eeking out the win at the last second. \n\nBut definitely also a sense of her coming along at the exact right time. I recognized her as what I had been looking for. The moment we met IRL I just knew \"Oh, THAT'S what I've been searching for and unable to find.\" Point and click. It was nearly effortless.\n\nBut I'm convinced that, had we encountered each other a year earlier, or even 6 months earlier, that it would not have worked out: I wasn't fully healed yet. I hadn't upgraded myself and figured out what it really is that I want (and don't want). Right before her I had become very skilled at ending \"just okay\" type situations because I knew something better was out there and I was never going to settle ever again for something shitty or even just ho hum. I think had it been any earlier, my profile wouldn't have given off the right vibe, I would have come off as insecure or inauthentic on our date, I would have tried too hard, I would have brought up stuff about my ex too early etc etc. \n\nAll of this is to say, you just kind of have to go through the process and \"trust the process\" as they say. For me, I had to have one final dance with the BPD devil to finally just get the message (I briefly dated another pwuBPD/NPD who was actually WORSE than my ex that landed me in this sub in the first place... But I actually think that was a good event for me because it gave me that confidence to know that I was \"safe\" in that I am able to see the red flags much earlier and act on them and GTFO before things get bad, which is exactly what I did in that case).\n\nAnd btw, my gf now is actually much hotter than my ex. Like, by a lot. (As in, feels way way out of my league to the degree that I'm surprised I'd ever be with someone that beautiful ever, let alone now at this stage of my life and after everything I've gone through etc). And the sex is better too... Which was something I was SURE would not be possible but yet here I am. The best thing of all though is I can have all of these great things WITHOUT that awful \"catch\"... There's no needing to tolerate any insane bullshit to have those other good things. When we have conflict, we deal with it like adults and have a direct conversation but with compassion and mutual respect and understanding. It's insane to me that I ever settled for anything less than that. I just didn't realize it was even possible I think (or, rather I had forgotten, since I'd had mostly healthy relationships before my BPDex). \n\nIt's gonna feel like a needle in a haystack kinda search. You may find another pwBPD. Or a series of them. It's frustrating and disheartening for sure. \n\nBut if you think about it, it kinda makes sense because those \"unicorns\" as you say are that way *because* they're rare. \n\nThey aren't just anyone, just some average person, and you don't want that anyway. You deserve more than that and that person is out there. \n\nBelieve me, if such a person exists for me, then it exists for anyone because I was absolutely sure I'd be alone or have to massively settle\u2014at least based on the only women who would match with me, seemingly. It's really kind of bizarre how it was, because it was like a string of 3s then suddenly a 10+ out of nowhere... \n\nYour mind expects it to be more consistent like maybe some 7s, maybe 8s etc etc, but nope, that's not how it works. But that's why it's easy to start to feel like nobody good is interested in you\u2014but really there's someone who will find the real you, with all your unique qualities your ex took for granted or never even saw, irresistible and like a breath of fresh air, I promise\n\nPlus, side note, I'm like a living example of not understanding my own objective level of attraction. In the past two years I've had more than one woman I know admit to me that they had a crush on me for years and always found me attractive (and they are absolute smoke shows who I would NEVER in a million years have thought would be interested in me). \n\nSo my point is, don't sell yourself short and don't let the apps get you down (they're literally designed to fuck with men's self esteem... It's a a constant sense of rejection, but it's artificially so. I'd be willing to bet you're much more attractive to women than you think you are. A lot of the qualities that make pwBPD target us are qualities that most women would kill to have in a partner. So many of us here are very intelligent, thoughtful, insightful, empathic people who are supportive and helpful to their partners. We bring a lot to the table, probably more than we realize.

Had I known that I could have saved myself a whole lot of despair and sadness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My advice would be, take my story as if it&amp;#39;s you going back in time and telling yourself what is to come... Wouldn&amp;#39;t that take the edge off? What would you do with this time if you knew it&amp;#39;s just a matter of waiting it out?  The thing is, this is not just a thought experiment, this is definitely what is going to happen for you, you need not worry. As long as you just keep going, and stay strong and don&amp;#39;t get hoovered, don&amp;#39;t break NC, you will see it will all turn out okay.  (I know when people said that kind of thing to me it rang pretty hollow at the time, and that&amp;#39;s to be expected... but still, seriously, it&amp;#39;s gonna be okay and you won&amp;#39;t feel like this forever).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11ri1lp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/BPDlovedones/comments/11ri1lp/so_the_reward_for_leaving_them_and_going_nc_is/jc9fvt5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/11ri1lp/so_the_reward_for_leaving_them_and_going_nc_is/", "name": "t1_jc9fvt5", "author_flair_template_id": "182a735e-4128-11ea-8600-0e72ff80b5e1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/BPDlovedones", "author_flair_text": "Dated", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678861157.0, "created_utc": 1678861157.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/11ri1lp/so_the_reward_for_leaving_them_and_going_nc_is/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_45hae8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Those were some expensive margaritas, son", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "CrazyFuckingVideos", "link_author": "ImDomina", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jc94o7w", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "JustGimmeSomeTruth", "num_comments": 1128, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jc91xlu", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_axcfl", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "For real, probably the type of dude who you have to subtract 50% from everything he says to get the actual story.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For real, probably the type of dude who you have to subtract 50% from everything he says to get the actual story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11rfxyj", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CrazyFuckingVideos/comments/11rfxyj/those_were_some_expensive_margaritas_son/jc94o7w/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyFuckingVideos/comments/11rfxyj/those_were_some_expensive_margaritas_son/", "name": "t1_jc94o7w", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CrazyFuckingVideos", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678853859.0, "created_utc": 1678853859.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://v.redd.it/gzkllafarsna1"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_45hae8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Those were some expensive margaritas, son", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "CrazyFuckingVideos", "link_author": "ImDomina", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jc8u7iu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "JustGimmeSomeTruth", "num_comments": 1128, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jc8ocj2", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_axcfl", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Maybe fees and checked bags etc made it add up to nearly 2k?
