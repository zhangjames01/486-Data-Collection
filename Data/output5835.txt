It's about a pair of identical twin brothers. The older is a detective, and the younger is a wanted criminal, and they have to share an identity because the younger is on the run. I really loved the performance from the actor who played the two brothers, as well as the main detective who was onto them. Warning that this show ends on a cliffhanger and season 2 was cancelled. However, especially towards the end of season 1 I was really enjoying this show. I think this show might have the brother dynamic you're looking for, since the older one is definitely the more \"serious\" one and the younger is the more reckless one. \n\n\\- **Secret of the Three Kingdoms** \\- I really hesitate to recommend this because the brothers plot is so small, as in, one of the brothers dies in the first episode. But it's a sibling story line that really compels me which is why I'm going to include it anyway. This is an alternate history story about the last Emperor of the Han Dynasty (which bled into the Three Kingdoms period). In this alternate history, the last Emperor had a secret younger twin brother who was raised out of the palace as a commoner, and now that the older brother is on his deathbed, his younger brother is being called back to the palace to serve in his place. Since one of the brothers dies at the beginning, there is very little interaction, but one of the character arcs for the main character is how he chooses to rule differently from his brother.\n\n\\- **The Disguiser** \\- An espionage drama set during the Sino-Japanese War centred on a family of siblings.  It's a web of family relations and political allegiances, with a solid cast, though otherwise it is a typical drama of its genre. \n\n\\- **The Young Warriors** \\- A historical drama based on a family of folk heroes called the Yang Family. The drama centres on the parents, sons #4-7 as well as their love interests. For much of the drama, it's fun times and adventures, but the movie does end in death and war, as is common for tales about the Yang Family folk heroes.\n\nMost historical dramas will have some element of family dynamics, especially in big families. That being said, particularly in palace dramas, the typical relationships between the brothers tend to be more of rivalry rather than a typical sibling relationship, but it may still interest you. Here are some of my favourites that have prominent prince relationships.\n\n\\- **Nirvana in Fire** \\- A typical \"battle of the princes\" story, with a revenge plot. A very representative and high quality work of the historical political genre. The main characters are one of the princes and his strategist.\n\n\\- **The Rise of Phoenixes** \\- Again a \"battle of the princes\" story. The main characters are one of the princes and a woman whose origins I cannot reveal for spoiler reasons. \n\n\\- **Ming Dynasty** \\- A drama that loosely follows the events of the Ming Dynasty. The main character is actually a woman who later becomes Empress Dowager. However, there is a princely conflict between her father-in-law (then Crown Prince) and his brothers.\n\n\\- **The Story of Minglan** \\- Not about royals but about commoner nobles.

You can watch it on Youtube with English subs [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPMDzh2bUa8P5gdXqJTL1X4sTa-ah1stu). It's an anthology series about people who buy magical \"lucky bags\" (where you don't know what's inside). Not all of them are about romance though. There were a couple of stories that were bittersweet, but most of them were wholesome and fun!\n\n\\- **Miss S** is a drama that's an adaptation of the Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. It's largely a crime solving drama but there is a lighthearted romance between the two main leads, the fun and cheeky detective and the uptight police officer.\n\n\\- **Medical Examiner Dr. Qin** is about a group of three colleagues, two coroners and a police officer. There isn't romance but I thought the chemistry between the three characters was so fun. The drama might be a little yucky because it's about coroners and corpses. As well, the cast changes every season, but I am specifically recommending the first season.\n\n\\- **Wu Xin the Monster Killer** is largely lighthearted as the  majority of the show is about hunting demons, and I thought the main couple was cute! However, it does have a very heavy ending so advance at your own peril. This drama has three seasons, but the first one was by far the best one. I wouldn't really recommend season 2 and 3 (the female lead also doesn't stay after season 1).\n\n\\- If you're ok with bromance dramas, I'd recommend **SCI Mystery**. A fun buddy cop drama. Nothing too deep but the drama itself is based on a webnovel that in turn was actually a fanfic of a classical Chinese work, so the relationship between the main couple is kind of fanfic-y. I thought it was really fun though haha.

You can watch it on Youtube with English subs &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPMDzh2bUa8P5gdXqJTL1X4sTa-ah1stu\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s an anthology series about people who buy magical &amp;quot;lucky bags&amp;quot; (where you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s inside). Not all of them are about romance though. There were a couple of stories that were bittersweet, but most of them were wholesome and fun!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Miss S&lt;/strong&gt; is a drama that&amp;#39;s an adaptation of the Miss Fisher&amp;#39;s Murder Mysteries. It&amp;#39;s largely a crime solving drama but there is a lighthearted romance between the two main leads, the fun and cheeky detective and the uptight police officer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Medical Examiner Dr. Qin&lt;/strong&gt; is about a group of three colleagues, two coroners and a police officer. There isn&amp;#39;t romance but I thought the chemistry between the three characters was so fun. The drama might be a little yucky because it&amp;#39;s about coroners and corpses. As well, the cast changes every season, but I am specifically recommending the first season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Wu Xin the Monster Killer&lt;/strong&gt; is largely lighthearted as the  majority of the show is about hunting demons, and I thought the main couple was cute! However, it does have a very heavy ending so advance at your own peril. This drama has three seasons, but the first one was by far the best one. I wouldn&amp;#39;t really recommend season 2 and 3 (the female lead also doesn&amp;#39;t stay after season 1).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- If you&amp;#39;re ok with bromance dramas, I&amp;#39;d recommend &lt;strong&gt;SCI Mystery&lt;/strong&gt;. A fun buddy cop drama. Nothing too deep but the drama itself is based on a webnovel that in turn was actually a fanfic of a classical Chinese work, so the relationship between the main couple is kind of fanfic-y. I thought it was really fun though haha.
