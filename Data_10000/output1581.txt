It is really sad that people are driven to this point. I can't attest to the person you're talking about specifically, because everyone's stories are are different, but many times, I don't think it is fair to argue that committing suicide is a selfish thing to do, or even if it was selfish, to argue that it was wrong to have acted selfishly. \n\nIt gets pretty bad, and if you haven't been suicidal before, it's hard to imagine that mindset. So you may justify your anger and loss by making accusations towards them because of what they've done. There isn't a lot of mental health awareness/understanding or tolerance in most places, so people are reluctant to come forth with things that are causing them to feel hopeless, and psychotically depressed.\n\nI have been hospitalized for psychosis/mania before and when it happened, I had never even heard about bipolar disorder, so I had no idea what was going on. It was like a spiritual awakening, like a religious experience. The most connected I had ever felt. When I was rehabilitated, I was extremely angry and resentful for having others treat my experience so critically and pathologically, and felt overwhelming despair because not only was I faced with living with the instability and fear of \"losing it\" again for the rest of my life, but I was encouraged to not speak to anyone I knew about it by everyone who knew what had happened...my parents, doctors, other friends who knew. It was private, a \"personal\" matter. Everyone I told looked at me like I was giving them too much information, or felt uncomfortable around me after I told them, and this made me feel ashamed. So I started bottling it up and hiding it. Most mental health treatment is poorly covered (if at all) by insurance. For a long time I was paying over $300 a month for meds (with terrible side effects) and therapy and that was with insurance. Psychiatric hospital stays cost 1000s of dollars and are not covered by insurance at all, and are also a terrifying place to be. And you constantly see things on TV about people with \"mental health problems\" going on shooting rampages, or killing their mom/kindergartners or something horrifying, and you wonder if it could be you on the news like that one day... It's one thing to die, but it's much scarier (to me) to think that I might do something horrible to someone else or someone I love while in a psychotic state and don't know what I'm doing... \n\nThis combination of fear and public intolerance can drive people to the point of suicide, and though it may seem selfish to people who lose someone to suicide...sometimes they may not have been trying to be selfish at all. It can be a tragic act of love for others in their lives to stop themselves from potentially hurting them if things go awry for some reason. It's not fair to put their choice on them so critically in all cases. \n\nAnyways, I don't know if that's what your friend was struggling with, but it's possible. It has certainly been on my mind when I have contemplated ending my life. Mental health issues are never very simple.

I can&amp;#39;t attest to the person you&amp;#39;re talking about specifically, because everyone&amp;#39;s stories are are different, but many times, I don&amp;#39;t think it is fair to argue that committing suicide is a selfish thing to do, or even if it was selfish, to argue that it was wrong to have acted selfishly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets pretty bad, and if you haven&amp;#39;t been suicidal before, it&amp;#39;s hard to imagine that mindset. So you may justify your anger and loss by making accusations towards them because of what they&amp;#39;ve done. There isn&amp;#39;t a lot of mental health awareness/understanding or tolerance in most places, so people are reluctant to come forth with things that are causing them to feel hopeless, and psychotically depressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have been hospitalized for psychosis/mania before and when it happened, I had never even heard about bipolar disorder, so I had no idea what was going on. It was like a spiritual awakening, like a religious experience. The most connected I had ever felt. When I was rehabilitated, I was extremely angry and resentful for having others treat my experience so critically and pathologically, and felt overwhelming despair because not only was I faced with living with the instability and fear of &amp;quot;losing it&amp;quot; again for the rest of my life, but I was encouraged to not speak to anyone I knew about it by everyone who knew what had happened...my parents, doctors, other friends who knew. It was private, a &amp;quot;personal&amp;quot; matter. Everyone I told looked at me like I was giving them too much information, or felt uncomfortable around me after I told them, and this made me feel ashamed. So I started bottling it up and hiding it. Most mental health treatment is poorly covered (if at all) by insurance. For a long time I was paying over $300 a month for meds (with terrible side effects) and therapy and that was with insurance. Psychiatric hospital stays cost 1000s of dollars and are not covered by insurance at all, and are also a terrifying place to be. And you constantly see things on TV about people with &amp;quot;mental health problems&amp;quot; going on shooting rampages, or killing their mom/kindergartners or something horrifying, and you wonder if it could be you on the news like that one day... It&amp;#39;s one thing to die, but it&amp;#39;s much scarier (to me) to think that I might do something horrible to someone else or someone I love while in a psychotic state and don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m doing... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This combination of fear and public intolerance can drive people to the point of suicide, and though it may seem selfish to people who lose someone to suicide...sometimes they may not have been trying to be selfish at all. It can be a tragic act of love for others in their lives to stop themselves from potentially hurting them if things go awry for some reason. It&amp;#39;s not fair to put their choice on them so critically in all cases. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s what your friend was struggling with, but it&amp;#39;s possible. It has certainly been on my mind when I have contemplated ending my life. Mental health issues are never very simple. I&amp;#39;m sorry for you and all others who were hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2d3bbc", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2d3bbc/what_is_the_worst_thing_you_have_ever_witnessed/cjlwflh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2d3bbc/what_is_the_worst_thing_you_have_ever_witnessed/", "name": "t1_cjlwflh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1407638625.0, "created_utc": 1407638625.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2d3bbc/what_is_the_worst_thing_you_have_ever_witnessed/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Masturbating while watching porn is like nibbling on crackers while watching people at an all you can eat buffet.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "link_author": "FastidiousSlacker", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cjlu0ay", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "edscott", "num_comments": 483, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_2d2uhr", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5wurt", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Eh.
