Honestly, this is his first try at this and he didn't do very well (which is fine; he's very good at other things--certainly a better cook than me).  While it's my first time growing wheat, I've been gardening intensively for fifteen years, and have read a couple of books about small-scale grain production.\n\n1) He is growing too small of a square of wheat to protect itself effectively from lodging, so it lodged very early.  Mine eventually mostly lodged, but only very late, after the grain development was nearly complete.\n\n2) Aphids are a larger problem in his warmer climate.  If I grew wheat here year after year, they may eventually find me and stick around, but I had no pest problems other than fungal: a little bit of smut, which is carried inside the seed, afflicts an entire grain head, and is ugly and easily picked out.\n\n3) His harvest method of big hedge clippers was horribly inefficient; he said that took him \"half a day.\"  My plot looked 4-5 times bigger and it took me an hour or so with a hand sickle.  I also threshed mechanically, while he bashed his grain heads inside a sack--exhausting and inefficient work.\n\n4) He literally *blended* his berries.  That will create a whole grain flour which is quite dark, and also probably create some oil rancidity due to heat, which can also affect color and certainly taste.  I used a Mockmill.  There is quite a difference between milling wheat and *blending* it.  My flour is not whole grain--it doesn't have bran and germ obliterated down to small particulate sizes--so it is on the whiter side of flour: as white as one can get with a mill and manual sieve-sifting.  To say this in another way, and speak directly to another one of your bewildering comments:\n\n&gt; You don\u2019t get a fluffy white bread from whole grain that is milled.\n\n\"Whole grain\" is the only thing that ever *is* milled.  You put whole grains into the mill.  The mill cracks those grains--the bran and germ fall out broken but substantially intact (depending on the settings of your mill) and the soft, crumbly endosperm crumbles into an off-white powder.  You can mill wheat fine enough that you also pulverize the bran and the endosperm into a very fine powder.  If you smash everything to smithereens and dump it all into the same output, that's called *whole wheat flour*.  And you certainly don't get fluffy white bread from whole wheat flour (not without a lot of dough conditioners and other ingredients).  Ragusea produced an extremely coarse whole wheat flour because he didn't mill it, he *blended* it, and he didn't even blend it very thoroughly--when he dumps it out, there's a component of that flour that's as coarse as grits.  The sharp bits of bran and germ physically cut and slice what would otherwise be a long, fibrous gluten network to ribbons, reducing its ability to form a web that traps fermentation gas and therefore creates a soft, typically-breadlike crumb.  Gas escapes, and you end up with a flat, dense, crumbly, muffiny-looking crumb like what Ragusea has.  Which is fine--he didn't seem to be going for anything else, and probably didn't want to buy an actual mill for this one video.\n\nMy manual sifting doesn't get every small speck of bran and germ out, which I think is visible from my video.  It's difficult to see on camera, but it also does have the slightly yellowish cast of freshly-milled flour which has not yet had many of its pigment compounds destroyed by oxidation.  But it's much lighter (you can see it *literally being spit out of the mill directly into the mixer bowl*) than what Ragusea gets from--I cannot emphasize this enough--*blending it with a blender*, which creates bad whole-wheat flour.  I have been grinding store-bought wheat berries for about 2 years before I grew my own, and the flour you get from them immediately is more or less what the flour from my own home-grown wheat berries, grown in this video, looks like.  Honestly, you can go find like a hundred videos of people grinding wheat berries with home mills--this is what the flour looks like.  After he has his not-great blended whole wheat flour, he appears to make bread without sifting it, which, although a lot of the bran and germ have been thoroughly pulverized, would have gotten at least some of the larger bits out.  It's perfectly fine to make bread out of the entire wheat, but it's going to look pretty dark.\n\nHonestly, what possible business do you think I'd have *swapping out wheat berries that I clearly grew myself* for store-bought ones, or swapping out the flour from them for store-bought flour?  \"Oh no, that doesn't look light enough, so I'll use store-bought white flour instead?\"  How would that make any sense?  What, exactly, would convince you that I grew my own wheat and milled it into flour on my kitchen counter and baked bread out of it? \n What an absolutely bizarre bit of Reddit sleuthing.", "edited": 1671826403.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, writing lengthy corrective defenses against the lazy accusations of some dude who spends much of his time on reddit commenting on scat porn pictures in the actual scat porn subreddit must be a new low for me and my life, but here goes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, your evidence for the &amp;quot;he faked some of this&amp;quot; posts you are spamming around both this and the &lt;a href=\"/r/videos\"&gt;/r/videos&lt;/a&gt; thread is &amp;quot;Adam Ragusea tried it and had a harder time/different results?&amp;quot;  What?

I also threshed mechanically, while he bashed his grain heads inside a sack--exhausting and inefficient work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) He literally &lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt; his berries.  That will create a whole grain flour which is quite dark, and also probably create some oil rancidity due to heat, which can also affect color and certainly taste.  I used a Mockmill.  There is quite a difference between milling wheat and &lt;em&gt;blending&lt;/em&gt; it.  My flour is not whole grain--it doesn&amp;#39;t have bran and germ obliterated down to small particulate sizes--so it is on the whiter side of flour: as white as one can get with a mill and manual sieve-sifting.  To say this in another way, and speak directly to another one of your bewildering comments:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You don\u2019t get a fluffy white bread from whole grain that is milled.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whole grain&amp;quot; is the only thing that ever &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; milled.  You put whole grains into the mill.  The mill cracks those grains--the bran and germ fall out broken but substantially intact (depending on the settings of your mill) and the soft, crumbly endosperm crumbles into an off-white powder.  You can mill wheat fine enough that you also pulverize the bran and the endosperm into a very fine powder.  If you smash everything to smithereens and dump it all into the same output, that&amp;#39;s called &lt;em&gt;whole wheat flour&lt;/em&gt;.  And you certainly don&amp;#39;t get fluffy white bread from whole wheat flour (not without a lot of dough conditioners and other ingredients).  Ragusea produced an extremely coarse whole wheat flour because he didn&amp;#39;t mill it, he &lt;em&gt;blended&lt;/em&gt; it, and he didn&amp;#39;t even blend it very thoroughly--when he dumps it out, there&amp;#39;s a component of that flour that&amp;#39;s as coarse as grits.  The sharp bits of bran and germ physically cut and slice what would otherwise be a long, fibrous gluten network to ribbons, reducing its ability to form a web that traps fermentation gas and therefore creates a soft, typically-breadlike crumb.  Gas escapes, and you end up with a flat, dense, crumbly, muffiny-looking crumb like what Ragusea has.  Which is fine--he didn&amp;#39;t seem to be going for anything else, and probably didn&amp;#39;t want to buy an actual mill for this one video.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My manual sifting doesn&amp;#39;t get every small speck of bran and germ out, which I think is visible from my video.  It&amp;#39;s difficult to see on camera, but it also does have the slightly yellowish cast of freshly-milled flour which has not yet had many of its pigment compounds destroyed by oxidation.  But it&amp;#39;s much lighter (you can see it &lt;em&gt;literally being spit out of the mill directly into the mixer bowl&lt;/em&gt;) than what Ragusea gets from--I cannot emphasize this enough--&lt;em&gt;blending it with a blender&lt;/em&gt;, which creates bad whole-wheat flour.  I have been grinding store-bought wheat berries for about 2 years before I grew my own, and the flour you get from them immediately is more or less what the flour from my own home-grown wheat berries, grown in this video, looks like.  Honestly, you can go find like a hundred videos of people grinding wheat berries with home mills--this is what the flour looks like.  After he has his not-great blended whole wheat flour, he appears to make bread without sifting it, which, although a lot of the bran and germ have been thoroughly pulverized, would have gotten at least some of the larger bits out.  It&amp;#39;s perfectly fine to make bread out of the entire wheat, but it&amp;#39;s going to look pretty dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, what possible business do you think I&amp;#39;d have &lt;em&gt;swapping out wheat berries that I clearly grew myself&lt;/em&gt; for store-bought ones, or swapping out the flour from them for store-bought flour?  &amp;quot;Oh no, that doesn&amp;#39;t look light enough, so I&amp;#39;ll use store-bought white flour instead?&amp;quot;  How would that make any sense?  What, exactly, would convince you that I grew my own wheat and milled it into flour on my kitchen counter and baked bread out of it? \n What an absolutely bizarre bit of Reddit sleuthing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zsx6li", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/zsx6li/last_year_i_grew_bread/j1d0n3r/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/zsx6li/last_year_i_grew_bread/", "name": "t1_j1d0n3r", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Breadit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1671795748.0, "created_utc": 1671795748.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij4SBArADI0"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Last year, I grew bread.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "videos", "link_author": "halfascientist", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j1b5b47", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "halfascientist", "num_comments": 647, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j1b4gxm", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_buqjl", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "is anything", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;is anything&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zslz4d", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/videos/comments/zslz4d/last_year_i_grew_bread/j1b5b47/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/zslz4d/last_year_i_grew_bread/", "name": "t1_j1b5b47", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1671754792.0, "created_utc": 1671754792.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij4SBArADI0"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1e", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Last year, I grew bread.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "videos", "link_author": "halfascientist", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j1b3p2l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "halfascientist", "num_comments": 647, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j1b25vw", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_buqjl", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Unfortunately not--even at that stage, [like most grasses, it has quite a serrated edge](https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/816590/view/edge-of-a-grass-blade-sem).
