Everyone's doing their thing in their lane, but the only thing you just need focus on is running *your* race. If you happen to trip up, perhaps even fall, you really just have to get up and keep on running because the race won't stop for you any more than the world will stop spinning just because you're having a tough time. There's many more obstacles ahead and if you keep thinking about what's behind you, you're never going to be able to overcome these challenges if you're constantly getting distracted by the past. You can't change what's already happened, the only thing you have control over is what's still to come. Giving the rest of the race your 100% is all you can do at this point and that's all you or anyone else can ask of you. But then what happens when the race is finished?\n\nWell now, let me go back to your question.\n\nI used to think that was such an apt analogy. For school, for life, for relationships, for breakups, for death - it's a sensible, rational attitude to everything in life captured by this perfect little metaphor. But here's the thing. I think if you read a lot of these comments, it's easy to someone not in your shoes to tell you what's the right thing to do. Giving advice for moving on is so easy because it's just common sense after all. Many are telling you what is the obvious thing to do and reading it, yeah, I agree! I'm sure deep down you know this to be true as well. But heartbreak is not a sensible thing. Logic goes out the window when it comes to love and loss of love.\n\nI know how it feels to lose someone close to you. Whether it's romantic, platonic, familial, or otherwise. I've lost it all this year. And it broke me. But I think what helped me get through it was not your standard \"try to forget the person and give it time until it all goes away\". How can you when someone occupies that space in your heart? What you're left with is a void, not a solution. Instead, I thought about the situation, thought about them, and tried to see the silver lining in what seemed like an endless chasm of gloom. I've always pushed things away and bottled things up all my life but just embracing the pain and heartache and allowing myself to experience all that grief and sadness was the only way I could move forward. It's like running away from a storm that's moving in the same direction as you. If you just brace yourself for the rain, it'll pass you by sooner. You know the saying \"life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about dancing in the rain\"? Well, I'm saying you should wait for it to pass because the rain can't last forever and even the worst storm's got to end. It's a part of nature and a part of life and if you always run away from it, you'll never know how to deal with it until you have no choice except to embrace it. So embrace it. It's not easy every day, but it's doable most days in time.\n\nRemember that life doesn't get better until you do. So focus on you, and allow yourself to experience the light and the dark side of human emotion and everything in-between. Find other things that interest you, and spend your time engaging in things that you enjoy. There's no magic formula, but you know best what makes you happy. As with hurdles, just keep putting one foot in front of the other and hopefully when you do this for long enough, one day you'll realize that you've come so far from where you started. Life isn't about living for someone else, it's about living for yourself. And who knows, perhaps some day after embracing everything that comes your way for long enough, you'll find that much deserved rainbow on the other side of the storm.
