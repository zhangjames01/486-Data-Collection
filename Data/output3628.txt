Medical care is probably a good thing for societies, but it isn't so influential on health that it stands out as the most important thing. Social factors (discrimination against certain groups, etc) and economic factors (distribution of income, how many people are in poverty) and structural factors (whether programs exist to correct for the social and economic problems) are largely what determine health. But here Denmark should be doing great, since they would appear to excel at all of these, plus awesome healthcare as a bonus. So why are they far below their neighbors and even other countries that one might think shouldn't match or exceed them? (e.g. Chile)\n\nThis question of Danish population health was so pressing that in the early 1990s the government issued a large report to try to address it. (SEE: lifetime in denmark, 1994, ministry of health). In 1970, for male life expectancy, DK was near the top of OECD countries, right alongside Norway and Sweden. By 1990 it was near the bottom, tied with the USA. For female life expectancy the story is even worse.\n\nOne possible answer is that *wealth* inequality in Denmark is (reportedly) quite high, despite being such an egalitarian society with low income inequality. I am basing this on Nowatzki 2012. Others who study population health have held this up as one reason why DK's health status lags behind other Scandinavian countries. My personal belief is that income / wealth / deprivation are mediated through sociological/cultural factors and become embedded (or not!) in biology in ways that are too complex and qualitative to try to reduce to pure numbers. I'd need to live in Denmark for a few years and then maybe I could say something useful about wealth inequality and whether it effects the way people understand their own role in Danish society and whether they feel marginalized/shamed/etc as a result. I'd welcome any comments you have on wealth inequality in DK and how wealth plays into how people see themselves and others and so on. (For example, in the US, you can get \"food stamps\" if you are quite poor, especially if you have children, and while having some extra access to food is certainly better than starving, the shame associated with using food stamps, probably has very detrimental effects to health ... this is my own opinion, but it's hard to argue that using food stamps isn't often associated with shame here, and it's also hard to argue that shame isn't a stressor strongly associated with poor health outcomes, so I feel pretty safe giving this example .. anyway, if wealth inequality doesn't have any social importance in Denmark, then it won't matter much for health, but if it's like food stamps here, then it will ... even if people at the \"bottom\" aren't starving, they may feel shame/etc). The concept of JanteLaw suggests to me that wealth inequality probably doesn't explain it.\n\nThe other answer has to do with women in the 70s going into the workforce (which they did in far higher numbers than in Norway and Sweden) and taking up smoking (which they also did in significant numbers) (data here from IHME and Helwig-Larsen \"women in danmark why do they die so young?\" 1998) and this began to show in lung cancer mortality (Juel 2000). Br\u00f8nnum-Hansen (2005) show a stagnation in life expectancy trends for 20yo women from 1970 to 2000 (literally the plot goes flat/wobbly). The last important point I'll make here that relates to women particularly is that health of societies has a lag time. If you look at Japan, post-WWII the conditions were created for population health to skyrocket, and in the decades following, it began to. (Cuba post 1955 would be another example.) The health of one generation influences the next. This might explain African American health in the US to some extent (beyond the effects of income, wealth, and racism) and has been called the \"slave health deficit\" by Byrd and Clayton. The quickest way to explain this might be to mention that the ovum that creates a person is not created when that person's mother gets pregnant with child, but rather was created at the time of conception of the mother, in own mother's womb. So the health status of the *grandmother* influences the status of the ovum that ultimately creates a grandchild some decades later. To a less obvious extent this is also true with sperm as well because of intergenerational epigenetic factors (again, lots of interesting studies here, but this is a huge topic unto itself). So if something went \"off track\" in health status in DK for a couple of decades, particularly among women who were going to become pregnant and give birth to the next generation, even after coming back \"on track\" we might see those effects have ripples in the coming decades. This idea is incredibly problematic from a political economy standpoint because it implies that whatever a nation (like the USA) might need to do to improve its poor health status, it would need to do that and keep doing it and wait decades to see lasting and obvious benefits \u2014 which much of what we do is predicated on showing benefits before the next election cycle, this is a major problem. \n\nI won't get into South Korea as I don't know as much about their health status offhand and my writing have already run into two long posts. I hope *some* of what I wrote was useful. This is a super interesting question, and if I had a week to write a summary paper on it (and no 10,000 character limit), well, I'd say a lot more.\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(...continued)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what do we know so far?

My personal belief is that income / wealth / deprivation are mediated through sociological/cultural factors and become embedded (or not!) in biology in ways that are too complex and qualitative to try to reduce to pure numbers. I&amp;#39;d need to live in Denmark for a few years and then maybe I could say something useful about wealth inequality and whether it effects the way people understand their own role in Danish society and whether they feel marginalized/shamed/etc as a result. I&amp;#39;d welcome any comments you have on wealth inequality in DK and how wealth plays into how people see themselves and others and so on. (For example, in the US, you can get &amp;quot;food stamps&amp;quot; if you are quite poor, especially if you have children, and while having some extra access to food is certainly better than starving, the shame associated with using food stamps, probably has very detrimental effects to health ... this is my own opinion, but it&amp;#39;s hard to argue that using food stamps isn&amp;#39;t often associated with shame here, and it&amp;#39;s also hard to argue that shame isn&amp;#39;t a stressor strongly associated with poor health outcomes, so I feel pretty safe giving this example .. anyway, if wealth inequality doesn&amp;#39;t have any social importance in Denmark, then it won&amp;#39;t matter much for health, but if it&amp;#39;s like food stamps here, then it will ... even if people at the &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot; aren&amp;#39;t starving, they may feel shame/etc). The concept of JanteLaw suggests to me that wealth inequality probably doesn&amp;#39;t explain it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other answer has to do with women in the 70s going into the workforce (which they did in far higher numbers than in Norway and Sweden) and taking up smoking (which they also did in significant numbers) (data here from IHME and Helwig-Larsen &amp;quot;women in danmark why do they die so young?&amp;quot; 1998) and this began to show in lung cancer mortality (Juel 2000). Br\u00f8nnum-Hansen (2005) show a stagnation in life expectancy trends for 20yo women from 1970 to 2000 (literally the plot goes flat/wobbly). The last important point I&amp;#39;ll make here that relates to women particularly is that health of societies has a lag time. If you look at Japan, post-WWII the conditions were created for population health to skyrocket, and in the decades following, it began to. (Cuba post 1955 would be another example.) The health of one generation influences the next. This might explain African American health in the US to some extent (beyond the effects of income, wealth, and racism) and has been called the &amp;quot;slave health deficit&amp;quot; by Byrd and Clayton. The quickest way to explain this might be to mention that the ovum that creates a person is not created when that person&amp;#39;s mother gets pregnant with child, but rather was created at the time of conception of the mother, in own mother&amp;#39;s womb. So the health status of the &lt;em&gt;grandmother&lt;/em&gt; influences the status of the ovum that ultimately creates a grandchild some decades later. To a less obvious extent this is also true with sperm as well because of intergenerational epigenetic factors (again, lots of interesting studies here, but this is a huge topic unto itself). So if something went &amp;quot;off track&amp;quot; in health status in DK for a couple of decades, particularly among women who were going to become pregnant and give birth to the next generation, even after coming back &amp;quot;on track&amp;quot; we might see those effects have ripples in the coming decades. This idea is incredibly problematic from a political economy standpoint because it implies that whatever a nation (like the USA) might need to do to improve its poor health status, it would need to do that and keep doing it and wait decades to see lasting and obvious benefits \u2014 which much of what we do is predicated on showing benefits before the next election cycle, this is a major problem. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t get into South Korea as I don&amp;#39;t know as much about their health status offhand and my writing have already run into two long posts. I hope &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of what I wrote was useful. This is a super interesting question, and if I had a week to write a summary paper on it (and no 10,000 character limit), well, I&amp;#39;d say a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_5vizpl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskSocialScience/comments/5vizpl/why_do_south_koreans_spend_so_little_on/de30bt1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/5vizpl/why_do_south_koreans_spend_so_little_on/", "name": "t1_de30bt1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskSocialScience", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1487798906.0, "created_utc": 1487798906.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/5vizpl/why_do_south_koreans_spend_so_little_on/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sml9", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Why do South Koreans spend so little on healthcare, yet live so long?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 93, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskSocialScience", "link_author": "Qwernakus", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "de2zyux", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "StructuralViolence", "num_comments": 36, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_5vizpl", "score": 93, "author_fullname": "t2_6rwz4", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I'm sorry but there's just to easy way to answer this briefly.

For the answers that neatly explain the health status of other nations, Denmark is an odd sort of exception (that is, egalitarianism and low levels of inequality, as well as average income and educational status, social expenditures, and so on all are normally very strongly associated with the health status of a society ... in Denmark, at the surface level, these associations don't *appear* to hold as well ... more on this in a sec). I will give a very brief answer; in the population health course for which I used to be a teaching assistant we dedicated multiple days to looking at Denmark's health status (after spending several weeks laying the groundwork for understanding population health), so there is just no way a random reddit comment, no matter how well cited, is going to explain this (and as I mentioned before, I am not fully satisfied by ANY of the answers I've come across for Denmark ... they get me about 70% of the way there, at best).\n\nDisclaimer: lots of citations below, but no time to turn them into links, and I am pulling them all from memory so some spelling or minor details might be wrong.\n\nOddly enough, medical care is not that strongly associated with population health status.

Several textbooks that deal with public health and population health say something to the effect of \"despite many efforts, no one has convincingly shown the role of medical care in improving health of populations\" (I am in this case paraphrashing a 2003 edition of Oxford textbook of Public Health). Institute of medicine's report \"shorter lives, poorer health\" states, \"Americans with healthy behaviors or those who are white, insured, college-educated, or in upper-income groups appear to be in worse health than similar groups in comparison countries\" ... so you can see that even our insured populations do poorly in America. There is something else about being in America, beyond medical care (because we can look at subgroups who have ready access) that is bad for health status. You can't randomize (for ethical reasons) trials of medical care vs no medical care, so it's hard to study. The few natural experiments of doctors and nurses strikes that have been studied do not show anything that is useful for those who want to demonstrate the importance of medicine to population health. Lots of interesting studies on narrow aspects of medical care and health ... for example, that African Americans are less likely to get cutting edge care when having a heart attack, but were actually less likely to die as a result because the cutting edge care in this case (a decade ago) had higher mortality rates (I think this was NEJM but forget the exact citation offhand), or for a second example that mortality rates go down in hospitals when cardiologists are away at a conference (see: Anupam JAMA 2014)\n\nInterestingly, although income, education, race, and so on are all associated with health at an aggregate level (ie being poor, being in a marginalized racial group, being uneducated all tend very strongly to be bad for health), there are exceptions. Sometimes we can use these exceptions to see the independent strength of one factor. In the US, being a high school dropout is bad for infant mortality (your children are more likely to die in the first year of life if you're uneducated). However, having a college education and being African American still leads to a higher (aggregate) risk of infant mortality than for white high school dropouts. In this one statistics we can see the way race has an effect on health that appears to more than counteract education. In the same way, Americans smoke far less than other rich countries, yet Japan has much better health than us (or essentially anyone) despite smoking far more than us (and basically anyone else among OECD countries). This isn't to suggest that smoking is healthy, but rather than some other aspects of being within America are so bad that they more than counteract our low smoking prevalence (or, alternatively, being in Japan is so good that smoking doesn't seem to harm them in the same way). The last thing I'll say here is that perhaps the most fascinating exception to invoke is the \"Latino Paradox\", in which those of hispanic ethnicity in America tend to enjoy some of the best health outcomes, despite largely being within a marginalized racial group, despite language and educational disadvantages, and so on ... the usual rules of what makes for good or bad health appear to apply less (or be counteracted) because of some other factor. Many have suggested (but not all experts are convinced) that cohesion and social support within Hispanic culture accounts for the paradox. There is a lot of evidence to show that social support has a very strong effect on mortality (see: holt lundstadt 2010 and 2015 \u2014 in the 2010 metaanalysis they show the effect or low social support to be equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day in terms of mortality within 5 years, and this is an n=300,000+ sample). \n\nReddit is telling me I am over the max character limit.

Absolute poverty today does not exist in a vacuum.)  \n\nRELATIVE POVERTY: Has to do with invidious comparisons we make between ourselves and others.  Humans are primates (social creatures), and we arrange ourselves in hierarchies and are constantly making subconscious comparisons to evaluate our own place in various hierarchies.  More than two decades of research on hierarchy and inequality and the effect on human health have robustly demonstrated that there is a social gradient in health, with worse health the further down the gradient you go, and this gradient appears directly related to inequality itself.  Furthermore, the steepness of the gradient means a greater effect on health (that is, it's curvilinear, and there is some threshold of lower inequality, below which ... at least on a population-level using the particular measures we often use ... we cannot detect much benefit).  Anyway, to put it simply, basically, if I can afford everything I need to survive (food, water, medicine, clothing, shelter), but essentially nothing else, and I see you driving your brand new $200,000 car, this is likely to have a negative effect on me.  These sorts of stresses are associated with activation of the HPA axis (release of cortisol and other chemical messengers that can have some acute benefit but lead to harm in the case of chronic exposure).  If you're curious about more related to relative poverty, anything from Kawachi, Wilkinson, Bezruchka, Krieger, or Marmot would be worth checking out.  Here is a [paper from Marmot](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK242456/#_sec_233_) that explains the HPA axis stuff (co-authored with Robert Sapolsky).  With my students I often try to emphasize ideas like 'imagine how you would feel if the new iPhone came out and you couldn't afford one \u2014 if you could only afford the model that was 3 generations old, with a cracked screen, but still worked fine for phone calls and whatever else'.  The rhetorical answer is that although it serves its purpose (a purpose that just 30 years ago was basically science fiction!), it's still something that might be a source of at least minor shame for most people.  Add up all the little bits of minor shame we experience because we don't have the right clothing, smartphones, car, furniture, electronics, a big enough house (or even own our own), a good enough job, because we don't make enough money, and so on.  These ideas also extend to other things that aren't financial, like race, ethnicity, religion, etc (although there are some interesting exceptions, but that's a post for another day).  So in this case, giving everyone 10x as much money means magnifying inequality.  Which means a steeper curve (higher gini coefficient), and almost certainly worse population-level health outcomes.  This idea, by the way, also applies to education.  Education is the ticket to a better future for *individuals*.  But if you could just magically give every American a masters degree tomorrow, it wouldn't solve our problems, because the structural inequalities that exist in employment will still be there (we have lots of people who make coffee for a living, and don't make very much, and a very few executives who make top dollar, and if every barista suddenly had a masters degree, it wouldn't get them any closer to being an executive, because they are still *relatively* impoverished compared to those with other advantages (PhD, the \"right\" connections in the form of family or social networks gained at elite institutions, etc).  So if CEOs making 400 times what their workers make is a problem, offering the workers free college is nice, but it doesn't solve the overall relative structural issues.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hinges on the difference between &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; poverty and &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; poverty.
