Barristan Selmy- The consensus best warrior in the time period of the books and show. His list of achievements in his Lord Commander of The Kingsguard biography in ASOS is staggering. In the books the only historical figures I would put above him would be Aemon the Dragonknight and Azor Azhai, possibly the sword of the morning.\n\n2. The Mountain- Maybe not the best fighter out of the rest, but his size just absolutely dominates. In the books he's described as eight feet tall and over 400 pounds, and the only person to [Major Tv/ASOS Spoilers](#b \"defeat him and survive was Loras Tyrell at the Tourney of the Hand. He also killed Beric Dondarrion twice, and strangled the Red Viper to death after taking multiple wounds with a poison spear.\") He's close to nonhuman, and pretty much unstoppable.\n\n3. Khal Drogo- I almost put him second, but we don't see enough of him in the books or the show. What we do know is that he is the undisputed alpha of a monstrously large Dothraki hoard, and that he has never been defeated in battle in his entire life. As Daenerys says (paraphrased), [AGOT](#b \"He died with his braid uncut, a feat few men achieve\") \n\n4. Jaimie Lannister- Consensus best swordsman in the seven kingdoms during the time period of the show. Swordplay isn't everything, but it is really significant. Barristan was probably better in his prime, but given his age and Jaimie's youth, the two-handed Lannister would likely defeat him. Also the youngest person ever to take the vows of the Kingsguard, which is pretty badass.\n\n5. Syrio Forrel- In his prime he was undoubtably the best swordsman in Braavos, or at least he claims. Ned seems to believe him, as I doubt he would pick someone unworthy to train Arya. He also held off Meryn Trant, a skilled swordsmen in his own right, and three other fully armored men with a stick long enough for Arya to escape. Almost enough to put him ahead of Jaime, but we don't know any of the things he did in Essos so it's hard to judge.\n\n6. Robert- In his prime he ended the only dynasty Westeros had ever known and killed the Last Dragon Rhaegor Targaryen in single combat at the Battle of the Trident. Similar to The Mountain in that his size aided him greatly, but from what we know Robert was a ferocious warrior in his youth.\n\n7. Jorah, Grey Worm, and Daario- I don't like lumping them together, but I understand why OP did it in relation to the show. Jorah brings their rank down pretty hard. He's respectable, but he's more comparable to someone like Bronn then these two. Daario is the leader of the Seconds Sons/Stormcrows, while Grey Worm the unsullied. Like Khal Drogo, we don't see many direct feats of strength or prowess from these two, but the fact that they were able to rise to thank rank should speak volumes. \n\n8. Oberyn Martell- He's called the Red Viper for a reason, and his rank falls in my list because he relies on poison so heavily. He is undoubtably deadly with a spear, and he has a reputation of one of the best fighters in Dorne. [Major TV/ASOS Spoilers](#b \"He dies at the hands of the Mountain, but his showing in the duel is a major reason he's ranked so high. If it were any other man in Westeros, the Viper would have won easily\") \n\n9. Ned- Similar to Robert in that he's a little washed up in the time period of the books and show, but at least in the show he holds his own against Jaime for a while. His feats during Robert's Rebellion gained him respect as a warrior, and him and Howland Reed were the only ones to survive the mysterious bloodbath in the Tower of Joy. \n\n10. Brienne- She has a major advantage in that most of her opponents take her for granted before and during a fight because she is female. She is huge for her sex, and very strong. Defeated Loras Tyrell in front of King Renly, and was able to wound a two-handed Jaime while trying to escort him to King's Landing. Had her below the Hound in my mind, but after writing this I had to move her up. \n\n11. Sandor Clegane- Major weakness in his fear of fire. It made him desert the Blackwater, and someone as small as Arya could reduce him to whimper with just a torch. Also has played second fiddle to Gregor his whole life. He's definitely a powerful soldier, but he needed Arya's help just to kill the Tickler and Polliver in that inn. In his prime, which I would argue is during the show and books, he doesn't really compare to those above him.\n\n12. Bronn- Like the Red Viper, he fights pretty dirty. Talks a lot of talk, but the only walk he really does is defeating a Knight of the Vale during Tyrion's first trial by combat. He fought at the Blackwater, but we don't really see him do anything amazing. He's knighted afterwards, but so was nearly everyone else who survived the battle. Not bad, but not anything really special.\n\n13. Ramsay- Put him above Jon Snow just based on the show, as in the books he really doesn't do anything. The scene with the Greyjoy's in undoubtably badass, but I kinda agree that the show version of the Greyjoy's pretty much suck at everything. Still, Asha is supposed to be formidable and he pretty much made her give up after being so determined so theres that.\n\n14. Jon Snow- Like OP said, Jon needed help from wolves to win pretty much every major conflict he's been in. In the books he [Major TV/ASOS](#b \"defends Castle Black against the Thenns and Wildlings with just a handful of defenders, so that's significant.\"). His prowess at Castle Black during training pretty much means nothing, as he had been training with a sword and a master at arms since he could hold one.\n\n15. Karl- A fooking legend indeed", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;(WARNING: All Spoilers are major for upcoming episodes and A Storm of Swords, but they are marked)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In their respective primes, I&amp;#39;d rank all the contenders OP listed as,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barristan Selmy- The consensus best warrior in the time period of the books and show. His list of achievements in his Lord Commander of The Kingsguard biography in ASOS is staggering. In the books the only historical figures I would put above him would be Aemon the Dragonknight and Azor Azhai, possibly the sword of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mountain- Maybe not the best fighter out of the rest, but his size just absolutely dominates. In the books he&amp;#39;s described as eight feet tall and over 400 pounds, and the only person to &lt;a href=\"#b\" title=\"defeat him and survive was Loras Tyrell at the Tourney of the Hand. He also killed Beric Dondarrion twice, and strangled the Red Viper to death after taking multiple wounds with a poison spear.\"&gt;Major Tv/ASOS Spoilers&lt;/a&gt; He&amp;#39;s close to nonhuman, and pretty much unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khal Drogo- I almost put him second, but we don&amp;#39;t see enough of him in the books or the show. What we do know is that he is the undisputed alpha of a monstrously large Dothraki hoard, and that he has never been defeated in battle in his entire life. As Daenerys says (paraphrased), &lt;a href=\"#b\" title=\"He died with his braid uncut, a feat few men achieve\"&gt;AGOT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaimie Lannister- Consensus best swordsman in the seven kingdoms during the time period of the show. Swordplay isn&amp;#39;t everything, but it is really significant. Barristan was probably better in his prime, but given his age and Jaimie&amp;#39;s youth, the two-handed Lannister would likely defeat him. Also the youngest person ever to take the vows of the Kingsguard, which is pretty badass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syrio Forrel- In his prime he was undoubtably the best swordsman in Braavos, or at least he claims. Ned seems to believe him, as I doubt he would pick someone unworthy to train Arya. He also held off Meryn Trant, a skilled swordsmen in his own right, and three other fully armored men with a stick long enough for Arya to escape. Almost enough to put him ahead of Jaime, but we don&amp;#39;t know any of the things he did in Essos so it&amp;#39;s hard to judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert- In his prime he ended the only dynasty Westeros had ever known and killed the Last Dragon Rhaegor Targaryen in single combat at the Battle of the Trident. Similar to The Mountain in that his size aided him greatly, but from what we know Robert was a ferocious warrior in his youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jorah, Grey Worm, and Daario- I don&amp;#39;t like lumping them together, but I understand why OP did it in relation to the show. Jorah brings their rank down pretty hard. He&amp;#39;s respectable, but he&amp;#39;s more comparable to someone like Bronn then these two. Daario is the leader of the Seconds Sons/Stormcrows, while Grey Worm the unsullied. Like Khal Drogo, we don&amp;#39;t see many direct feats of strength or prowess from these two, but the fact that they were able to rise to thank rank should speak volumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oberyn Martell- He&amp;#39;s called the Red Viper for a reason, and his rank falls in my list because he relies on poison so heavily. He is undoubtably deadly with a spear, and he has a reputation of one of the best fighters in Dorne. &lt;a href=\"#b\" title=\"He dies at the hands of the Mountain, but his showing in the duel is a major reason he&amp;#39;s ranked so high. If it were any other man in Westeros, the Viper would have won easily\"&gt;Major TV/ASOS Spoilers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ned- Similar to Robert in that he&amp;#39;s a little washed up in the time period of the books and show, but at least in the show he holds his own against Jaime for a while. His feats during Robert&amp;#39;s Rebellion gained him respect as a warrior, and him and Howland Reed were the only ones to survive the mysterious bloodbath in the Tower of Joy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brienne- She has a major advantage in that most of her opponents take her for granted before and during a fight because she is female.
