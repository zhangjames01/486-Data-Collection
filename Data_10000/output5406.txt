Now the gold-filled/Rolled Gold Plate/Stainless/Nickel watches (Note:most of my collection are these 30-40 pieces) are different because they have little to no inherent gold value but I pick designs I like and make sure to get the best deal I can and ultimately ask myself if I can&amp;#39;t resell it later or if it is worth less than I paid will I be upset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I don&amp;#39;t buy watches for value I buy them for the pleasure of history associated or unique time period design. So sorry for the wall of text and I hope this gives some insight as to why I collect/buy watches and can help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2clkzt", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Watches/comments/2clkzt/question_how_do_you_justifyto_yourself_spending/cjgoo8f/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/2clkzt/question_how_do_you_justifyto_yourself_spending/", "name": "t1_cjgoo8f", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Watches", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1407172262.0, "created_utc": 1407172262.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/2clkzt/question_how_do_you_justifyto_yourself_spending/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qi58", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[Post Match Thread] - United States of America v Belgium - Round of 16", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "soccer", "link_author": "TheNoob29", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cimnwnt", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "afancybananahammock", "num_comments": 4943, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cim9zry", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_9jz6c", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Oh I didn't know!!
