amazingly different! i got to watch nyc get cleaned up, get a bit less clean, then see the aftermath and cleanup of 911.\n\n\nfrom around 1982 to 1997, i'd take the metro or amtrak from upstate into nyc anywhere from a few times a month to a few times a quarter. in the beginning, with my family or to visit my aunt in nyc. later on, it was for fun and to gatecrash conventions i had no business being in when i was 15-16, like computex, or whatever was going on at the jacob k javits.\n\n\nit was interesting, to say the least. and then i;d visit from way out-ofstate every year or two; catch something on broadway, get me some h&amp;h bagles, completely fail to find a good chinese restaurant in chinatown. if it was the winter, i'd play with the toys at fao, go skating at rockefeller center, eat hot pretzels from food carts that smelled like chestnuts and a bit of sewer gas, see something at rko if there was anything besides disney's something something [on ice, ice spectacular, extravaganza]. hang out in soho, get some coffee... and if i had $20mto blow, i'd get a long island iced tea and see if any ladies would buy me a drink in return for smiles and good stories that were true enough to keep me from being a liar :)\n\n42^nd street was... interesting... especially when you are young and curious. there was a lot more petty crime. i was the \u201dvictem\u201d of 3 attempted robberies in a single afternoon in broad daylight (just keep walking, they freak out), as well as propositioned buy a few people of negotiable affection\u00b9\n\nporn was ubiquitous growing up. there was always people handing out flyers with supposedly famous sex dancers doing something that sounded like it hurt for some limited time. i ended up bumming a cigarette to one of the sex dancer ladies when i was in a cafe. she was a contortionist. as she had one of the more rare specialties, to keep herself and act new, she said she'd change her stage name, background story, and sometimes race or nationality a couple times a year. she showed me some pics, and i could see that they were all her, but i;d have never known if she didn't tell me. she said she got the idea from studying foo man chu (the magician) and houdini and a lot of stage magic's presentation, showmanship, and showbiz. oddly (i thought at the time) she had a degree in acting, medieval literature, and studied mime growing up. apparently mime + contortion was a huge money making act.\n\n\ni asked her if all the working women were like her: smart, beautiful, fun... she laughed and said she was maybe 1 in 100, maybe 1 in 1000, and that half the girls were \u201dactors\u201d, two thirds were on coke (and half of the remaining third were bad liars with runny noses), half the girls were there because they didn't have any skills and needed food. she said it wasn't a good thing, for the most part, and was *very* predatory. i believed her.\n\n\nshe thought giuliani wanting to clean up the city was a good thing, but he was going to fuck it up and send the bad shit far, far underground where it'd result in even worse practices. she was right.\n\n\nthe very last horn &amp; hardart\u00a0(as well as the very last) [automat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automat) closed in 1991. those were a childhood favorite of mine and i was sad to see them go. the food was increasingly bad and nearly always more bland/worse than i remembered. i have a pretty good memory for things like this, and i'd have picked an automat over McDonald's when i was 10, even though the weird mcdonalds cherry pie hotpot thingy that came in a paper sleeve was pretty darn craveable.\n\n\nthe city's smell changed quite substantially, and to the point it no longer navigable or even identifiable by scent. after the decline of porn, the  the cleanup, the smells were more disney presents new york city. after smoking indoors went away, everything smelled really, really bad for a year or two: smoke stench hid a lot of nastiness, especially in bars and the low-life places i loved to frequent.\n\n\nsome of the really cool museums went away, like the national museum of holography, which was one of my favorites.\n\n\nthen the towers got knocked the fuck down and the city lost its mind for a few weeks. surprisingly how solid and sane the reaction was in nyc when it went batshit.\n\n\nvisiting the hole was was more heart wrenching than i thought it would be, and i cried my eyes out for three days while i was staying at a little old small hotel walking distance from times square. i didn't get propositioned once, nobody tried to mug me, and the cops ignored the jamaican looking dude on rollerblades and gold lame everything passed by really fast smoking a *really* strong smelling blunt.\n\n\nwatching cell phones go from *nobody* has them to *nobody is without them, + kids was a slow motion trip. in the early days, when bluetooth headsets/earphones (since just after the rise of

shops and public places seem to have lost their charm a bit, as well as stopped being places you met randomly interesting people and played chess with them. everyone is now hiding behind their notebook computers (not notebook and fountain pen aspiring writer).\n\n\ni 'm an outsider now, and i haven't been back in 5 or 6 years, but it seemed more closed off, less quirky, less fun... more generic franchise clones, less original, less beautiful. much more corporate (i realize i'm saying this about nyc).\n\n\ni feel this is about a good closing place, especially as i am falling asleep

coked out of her gourd, i might have seen what $100 would get me... if i didn't know any better, which i did. she was oddly adorable in a sort of waif-y elf-ish kind of way, with the most startling pale blue eyes. meh, i was 15 and a stupid, horny girl who wasn't quite ready to officially commit to lesbianism in the very late '80s, despite finding nearly every male\u00b2 to not be attractive, especially sexually.\n\n\n2: i found 2 boys attractive when i was a teen, although i never dated or did anything other than make out with one of them. i found out 20 years later that the one i made out with tried to commit suicide, failed, was in a psych facility for most of a year, then came out transgender and \u201dbecame\u201d a woman. i'm very happy for her, despite losing the connection. i thought when i was making out with 'him' that it felt like kissing a girl, and that 'he' was a very good kisser. turns out i *was* kissing a girl... we just didn't know it at the time! \n\n\nmy friend beth also ended up making out with 'him' briefly, but said 'his' kissing wasn't right and it turned her sink right the fuck off... sort of like drunk kissing me. beth turned out to be exceptionally straight, although she thought she was bi because she'd get drunk and \u201dmake out\u201d and \u201dbe hot\u201d with some of the other girls (especially the ones that liked girls. beth *was* cute). she'd make sure boys were watching, though, and if one of them was her love-of-the-night, she'd get more into it. \n\n\ni didn't talk to her after highschool, save that one time i was in town around beth's 20^th birthday, and i snuck her into a local bar. she got wasted and professed her straightness, telling me she wasn't going to make out with me and that she regretted doing it, that she was only doing it because the boys found it hot, and that she wasn't going to sleep with me. the drunkerer she became, the more insistent she became that she wasn't in to me, and that i shouldn't pretend to be gay to get boys. it was really fucking weird. i'm all, \u201dbeth, baby, i really am a big 'ol dyke. i like women. i like vaginas. they're delicious! and you don't have to worry, straight chicks aren't attractive when they tell me i'm straight. oh, and here's a picture of my [totally far hotter than you ever *was* or ever *will be*] half mexican half persian girlfriend\u201d\n\n\nbeth did not approve of my ladyfriend, although i could see that beth was upset that she was prettier than beth, and beth couldn't handle that my lady looked so free and naturally happy with a dreamy genuine smile. \n\n\nso beth insisted on driving home, so i called her a cab knowing it was the last thing i'd ever do for her and the last time i'd ever see one of my now ex-best friends. she's married with kids now; i hope she's happy, but i'm done with bigots.\n\n\n3: douche-wort: the partially hidden very expensive bluetooth earpiece, worn throughout the day to let you know how important this guy

wands or \u201dbetter\u201d touch controllers: it's an attempt at functionally accomplishing what a pair of haptic datagloves would do, except with the tech currently available at a price that is

closer to the ideal than anything affordable so far.\n\n\n\nlike anything of substantial novelty, you kind of have to just jump right in and *use* them, and have a bit of childlike enthusiasm in something new, instead of making a mental list of everything that's different and makes you slightly uncomfortable because you have to figure something new out. you either hop on the skateboard and give it an honest go, or you stare at it like it's going to attack, mumble something unintelligible to those around you about breaking yourself, turn around, and go eat a big mac.\n\n\n\nfwiw, people end up putting the strap on way too tight, then complaining it's uncomfortable, or wanting realism in games but disliking having to *actually* use your hand to hold something. the strap should rest gently, but slightly snug, just on the wrist side of your knuckes, opposite of the top of your palm. the knuckle strap should be loose enough you should be able to slide these on and off without needing to fuck with the knuckle strap or change its tension, yet snug enough to not quite fall off your hand.\n\n\n\ndon't forget to push the top strap mount *in* before adjustment; if you don't, you'll break it. you should have the top strap mount in a position such that it's comfortable to get to all of the doodads on the control surface, although pressing the recessed system button should be a bit tricksey: that is by design, as accidentally pressing it has been a common complaint about every lighthouse based controller (all both versions) before the index controllers, and even some of the knuckes' early prototypes.\n\n\n\neven though the controllers self calibrate their finger tracking continuously, you will have to help them along manually every now and then... especially at the beginning of sessions. the same process will generally fix not-quite-accurate finger tracking, and it's easy to do: just roll fingers 3-5 (middle, ring, and pinky) a couple of times on the controller like you are bored or impatient. that's it!\n\n\n\nafter more than a year of use, *my* two design complaints are:\n\n\n- finger tracking *requires* thumb on the control surface, 1 on trigger, and 3-5 on the handle. i wish it worked with 2-5 on handle as well, as i'm not always using something with a trigger.\n\n\n- the tracking pad's pill-like shape makes it much less useful as a tracking pad. i wish it was a bit bigger and rounder. to be honest, i'd have been happy if they came with a big tracking pad and no joysick. \n\n\n\n&lt;rant&gt; while i realize a lot of people like joysicks, and can't seem to function without them, i can't help but think they're a carry over tech that is there not because it's better, but because people don't like new things, even if they say they do. what they mean when they say they want something new is that they want the same thing they already have, but not worn out or halfbroke from abuse, but maybe a new color and make it cheaper and indestructible and waterproof and make it have a higher number of some statistic i can't actually explain that won't make anything better without a bunch of other things, but screw those things because all i care about is the [thing] and the numbers it has. kind of like the whole pimax 8k hmd with a lot of fov that isn't actually 8k, or even 4k, and has shitty blacks, is uncomfortable, slow, flakey, unstable, cheaply built, and i only run it at reduced fov because any wider has too much distortion... but fuck the index, because it has worse blacks than the vive, and the knuckes because they feel different and they didn't live up to the hype i'm addicted to. but, yeah, i like new things, as long as they're absolutely perfect to the nebulous expectations i had. grrrrr! i am roarrrr! &lt;/rant&gt;\n\n\n\nalso, if you want something that works naturally with the index controllers (i still like the 'knuckles' moniker better), and something strange and beautiful, different, enchanting, and otherworldly, give [fujii](https://store.steampowered.com/app/589040/Fujii/) a go! it's one of my all-time favorites... but i wish it was a bit longer. even so, you can keep growing your garden indefinitely, and i like to go and visit mine every couple of days, just to hang out, before i go to sleep.\n\n\n\nwhile i'm doing all of this writing, because i'm stuck in bed with my tablet and an eyepatch on until i can find an affordable opthalmologist, i would like to bring up that vr is and will be changing the definition of what we call a game. \u201dgames\u201d on pcs and

would like you to read this post in its entirety, and the bit you are about to skip will likely be important to the resolution of your tracking issues eventually (as well as being at least a little entertaining), i would like you to skip to the location of the treasure contained in the documentation of my rather whimsical thought process. please go to the x that marks the spot and continue from there. \n\n\nlet's look at a few other things. what are your system specs, in detail? sometimes there's a clue in there.\n\n\n\nhave you had any other vr equipment installed on this computer?\n\n\n\ndo you have any other gaming controllers connected? or anything besides a mouse, keyboard,  and display?\n\n\n\ndo you have a lot of wireless things around? wireless headphones, network, bluetooth stuff, a major radio station, a cell tower, or a satellite uplink or radio telescope?\n\n\n\nare you in the usa? if not, in which country are you, and did you order your index to your country or get it by proxy?\n\n\n\ni'm taking a lot of shots in the dark here, i  hopes we hear a scream or squeal or really anything other than a bang and ringing ears. a lot goes into debugging odd and recalcitrant problems when you are on site. often something seemingly innocuous can turn out to be the culprit, and as i'm not there i can't notice the slightly blue haze in the air around the closet in the back of the room and your friend complaining her mouth tastes of pennies... then pull a sherlock holmes and point at the closet and say \u201daha! your tracking issues are due to the illicit iranian nuclear waste dump in your closet! i almost missed it, but the blue glow is really cherenkov radiation, and the taste of pennies *isn't* this copper tongue ring but gamma radiation shorting out your sensory cortex!\u201d\n\n\n\nso i am reduced to asking ridiculous questions, instead. it's like trying to play superhot vr, except my only controller is a text only vt100 connected to someone else's mainframe running a mix of zork! and eliza over tty. \n\n\n\nin other words, i find it challenging, intriguing, and rewarding.\n\n\n\n#x that marks the spot\n\n\n\ni'm thinking along these lines, so please correct or add to this as well. it is important that our facts are correct, and assumptions are dangerous.\n\n\nso, as your headset *is* tracking perfectly, no stuttering in the tracking at all, smooth as butter, correct?\n\n\nand graphically, everything is running fine, so skips, judder, chunks of the display turning the completely wrong shade of green, or anything like that?\n\n\nthe *only* probably you notice is that your controllers are moving around virtually an inch any direction (x, y, z) without moving around in meatspace, correct? is the virtual motion smooth or jerky? is it continuous, or does it come in spurts? if it comes in spurts, are they regular, or random? are these inaccuracies limited to linear translation, or is rotation involved as well?\n\n\n\nthe picture i get from what i have as givens, assuming my listed assumptions are correct (please confirm them), is that this has a high likelihood of some form of radio interference or something is messing with the controller's receivers conveniently located on the inside of your hmd. if your hmd is tracking fine, then your base stations are likely working properly. if your hmd is tracking fine everywhere, but your controllers aren't tracking *anywhere*, even when you try them at the exact same spot the hmd worked, we have to look at the difference between the hmd and the controllers.\n\n\n\nassuming you have done the normal things like make sure the controllers are charged, our primary difference between hmd and controllers is that the controllers are wireless, which leads us to examine the wireless link. \n\n\n\nas we weren't getting anywhere covering things with blankets, let us see if we can come up with a way to test our \u201dit's something buggered with the wireless bit\u201d hypothesis.\n\n\nlet's try giving a controller a wire! ok, i want you to:\n\n\n- shut down steamvr, and make sure your controllers' power is off\n\n\n- remove the shiny magnetically attached faceplate from your index hmd.\n\n\n- connect *one* controller to the type-a usb port on the front of your index hmd with a usb type-a to type-c cable that you know works with data as well as power.\n\n\n- wait for windows to finish automatically installing drivers for your controller, settle down, and compose itself\n\n\n- turn your now wired controller on. this *should* start steamvr. if it doesn't start steamvr manually by clicking on the vr button on the top right of your steam window\n\n\n- do not turn your other, still wireless, controller on yet.\n\n\n- once steamvr is going and you are in your virtual domicile, examine the tracking of your controller. is it steady now? is it behaving as expected, save the wire we just added?\n\n\n- power up your other controller. once it is up and running, does *it* still exhibit unwanted movement and inaccurate tracking?\n\n\nonce you have read all this and tried it, please let me know the results!\n\n\n:)", "edited": false,

documentation of my rather whimsical thought process. please go to the x that marks the spot and continue from there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;let&amp;#39;s look at a few other things. what are your system specs, in detail? sometimes there&amp;#39;s a clue in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;have you had any other vr equipment installed on this computer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;do you have any other gaming controllers connected? or anything besides a mouse, keyboard,  and display?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;do you have a lot of wireless things around? wireless headphones, network, bluetooth stuff, a major radio station, a cell tower, or a satellite uplink or radio telescope?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;are you in the usa? if not, in which country are you, and did you order your index to your country or get it by proxy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m taking a lot of shots in the dark here, i  hopes we hear a scream or squeal or really anything other than a bang and ringing ears. a lot goes into debugging odd and recalcitrant problems when you are on site. often something seemingly innocuous can turn out to be the culprit, and as i&amp;#39;m not there i can&amp;#39;t notice the slightly blue haze in the air around the closet in the back of the room and your friend complaining her mouth tastes of pennies... then pull a sherlock holmes and point at the closet and say \u201daha! your tracking issues are due to the illicit iranian nuclear waste dump in your closet! i almost missed it, but the blue glow is really cherenkov radiation, and the taste of pennies &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; this copper tongue ring but gamma radiation shorting out your sensory cortex!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so i am reduced to asking ridiculous questions, instead. it&amp;#39;s like trying to play superhot vr, except my only controller is a text only vt100 connected to someone else&amp;#39;s mainframe running a mix of zork! and eliza over tty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;in other words, i find it challenging, intriguing, and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;x that marks the spot&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m thinking along these lines, so please correct or add to this as well. it is important that our facts are correct, and assumptions are dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;so, as your headset &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; tracking perfectly, no stuttering in the tracking at all, smooth as butter, correct?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and graphically, everything is running fine, so skips, judder, chunks of the display turning the completely wrong shade of green, or anything like that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; probably you notice is that your controllers are moving around virtually an inch any direction (x, y, z) without moving around in meatspace, correct? is the virtual motion smooth or jerky? is it continuous, or does it come in spurts? if it comes in spurts, are they regular, or random? are these inaccuracies limited to linear translation, or is rotation involved as well?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;the picture i get from what i have as givens, assuming my listed assumptions are correct (please confirm them), is that this has a high likelihood of some form of radio interference or something is messing with the controller&amp;#39;s receivers conveniently located on the inside of your hmd. if your hmd is tracking fine, then your base stations are likely working properly. if your hmd is tracking fine everywhere, but your controllers aren&amp;#39;t tracking &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;, even when you try them at the exact same spot the hmd worked, we have to look at the difference between the hmd and the controllers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;assuming you have done the normal things like make sure the controllers are charged, our primary difference between hmd and controllers is that the controllers are wireless, which leads us to examine the wireless link. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;as we weren&amp;#39;t getting anywhere covering things with blankets, let us see if we can come up with a way to test our \u201dit&amp;#39;s something buggered with the wireless bit\u201d hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;let&amp;#39;s try giving a controller a wire! ok, i want you to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;shut down steamvr, and make sure your controllers&amp;#39; power is off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;remove the shiny magnetically attached faceplate from your index hmd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;connect &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; controller to the type-a usb port on the front of your index hmd with a usb type-a to type-c cable that you know works with data as well as power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wait for windows to finish automatically installing drivers for your controller, settle down, and compose itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;turn your now wired controller on. this &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; start steamvr. if it doesn&amp;#39;t start steamvr manually by clicking on the vr button on the top right of your steam window&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;do not turn your other, still wireless, controller on yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;once steamvr is going and you are in your virtual domicile, examine the tracking of your controller. is it steady now? is it behaving as expected, save the wire we just added?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;power up your other controller. once it is up and running, does &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; still exhibit unwanted movement and inaccurate tracking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;once you have read all this and tried it, please let me know the results!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;:)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {},
