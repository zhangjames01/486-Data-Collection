this i feel would held act against the commercialisation effect where everyone becomes generic clones all buying into the same mass produced culture &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;also further there&amp;#39;s the development of 3d modelling tools and similar which will allow people to 3d print things they create - this could be amazing for people wanting to organise the tools on their garage wall, have interior decor that fits a theme or anything like that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;also there&amp;#39;s the possibility of robot tooling for being able to use similar methods to design really good quality things using scrap or awkward lumber which would allow your robot to look at a pile of stuff and work out how to make a really cool bench or gazebo or what ever you ask it to - this would reduce the amount of resources being discarded in landfill and allow the use of coppiced lumber that might otherwise be useless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;anyone got any other interesting ideas?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10la96o", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/StableDiffusion/comments/10la96o/i_illustrated_my_video_about_potential_positive/j5vldfn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/10la96o/i_illustrated_my_video_about_potential_positive/", "name": "t1_j5vldfn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StableDiffusion", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1674682570.0, "created_utc": 1674682570.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkQHvWL6tVs"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3g4vm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Time to Return", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Pigrow", "link_author": "LochlannVonWoolfgard", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j5vjg3l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "The3rdWorld", "num_comments": 1, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_10a6vk1", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3slhr", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "hey sorry i've been busy and only just saw this comment, great to have you back -

Though there there are still major tabs to be ported over and rewritten (graphs, timelapse, user logs) so they&amp;#39;ll need to be done too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also updated the cron panel&amp;#39;s add cron dialog box, so far just tidied and updated the code to use fonts, sizers, etc ready for improvements i&amp;#39;m planning. first i want to add options for setting the time on repeating jobs, for example a daily job you&amp;#39;ll be able to set the min and hour it triggers every day. Also replace the day of the week box with tick boxes so it&amp;#39;s easier to use (useful making a job that runs only on weekends or weekdays for example, or 8 pm every monday) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The led control is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; done, there&amp;#39;s one awkward issue with how parakitmo handles ssh that i need to figure out the best way of solving but the actual code on the pigrow for setting up leds is all working and ready to be released properly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My current plan before the next release is to finalise those tabs, add the archive grow and start new grow buttons to the local files tab, and go quickly go over the other tabs to clean them up and finalise a few things.

are basically the same cost as the price difference between the two) so if i'm using a webcam in the build rather than a picam it can be easier, likewise it's a bit better at HDMI if you want to run a
