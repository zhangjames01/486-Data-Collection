The paladin tends to prime everything so fast that it is basically the only primer that can get its job done on the team. This can be very bad for synergy.\n\nIMO people should be allowed to play what they want. But it is always much appreciated when people realize how their setup may interfere with others (who were already in the lobby and had picked a setup) and switch accordingly. BTW you don't necessarily have to switch to a biotic or w/e the rest of the team is. You could always swap to a neutral type character (combo wise) and use the Destroyer, Turian Soldier, or something like that. \n\nAs for other characters that annoy people for a similars reason, the big one I'd point to is flamer spam kits. If you use flamer to prime (use for a second or two then cancel) and then detonate it with carnage or cluster nades, then it isn't particularly annoying.
