People can still enjoy it but should use common sense and know the dangers to protect themselves and family and the wildlife in them\n\nPets can get lost in the woods, get in trouble on hard to reach or steep hillsides, or fall into strong currents in rivers where owners get in trouble or killed trying to save them. They can eat by accident a toxic plant or attack rare animals nests. Farmland can be dangerous too, if the farmer had sprayed pesticides recently, farming equipment, livestock stampedes or livestock becoming maimed by dogs, and farmers with guns. \n\nPets are family but you really need to be thinking of their safety over picturesque moments. Like you wouldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t let your child chase cattle, play on farming equipment or run alone in the woods or a remote hillside without safety in mind. As much as older gen talk about \u2018back in my day we did x\u2019 they also have stories of how a childhood friend died or was maimed. We changed attitudes to protect children with safety and we should do some for pets on wild or rural areas \n\nIt could be a call that more areas need big dog parks that\u2019s fenced off and maintained so people have a safer alternative. So people can give their pet free run exercise without risk. While enjoying wild spaces with their dog on a leash when it\u2019s safe for wild animals too (like not during key breeding seasons)\n\n&gt; Dozens of cases across the country of wildlife and livestock being damaged by dogs have been documented by the Wildlife Trusts. In Little Woolden Moss, Salford, dogs chase away curlews, lapwings and little ringed plovers, sometimes killing chicks in their nest. In Kent, there were at least eight dog attacks on Wildlife Trust staff and livestock, with 13 sheep killed.
