For context, she was maybe 10 or 11 at the time and had a history of behaviors such as stealing food and secret eating (We have her on video at 2 years old, swiping my birthday cake while I opened gifts and once she stole a bag of cherries and ate the entire thing in the middle of the night, so it's not merely limited to unhealthy stuff.)\n\nDespite her best efforts, when my mom enrolled my sister in year long gym (as opposed to the requisite semester) and put her on the Atkins diet (which my parents adopted as well), my sister simply left her gym clothes behind somewhere so she didn't have to participate and stole whatever foods she could get her hands on. And of course there was the issue of school lunches, which she'd simply steal money for.\n\nNow, I'm not saying my sister's behaviors are completely on her because as a psychology student, I understand they needed to be reinforced or at least not properly punished by my parents to be maintained. Especially for 10 years. But even though my sister was very much still a child without a clear understanding of the long term implications of her choices, she still made choices all the same. My mom couldn't make my sister stick to being active or eating her altered diet, only she could.\n\nAgain, the caveats of behavioral psychology make this a much more complex issue than I'm alluding to, but I just want to play devil's advocate for the uneducated parents out there who aren't necessarily acting (or rather, not acting) out of ignorance or apathy. Their child's behaviors and subsequent decision making skills *are* their responsibility to model/encourage appropriately, but without education on their part, even the best of intentions can fall short. Plus, you have to keep in mind that those same parents are probably modeling what they learned from *their* parents so finger pointing only goes so far.\n\nTo make another point, I am, as I mentioned, a child of an obese family. Yet when I was in high school, I learned about proper diet and exercise and took it upon myself to lose my excess weight. Granted, I was under my parents' authority while I was younger, but at a certain point that lessened and I possessed the autonomy to inform myself and change accordingly.\n\nTL;DR Behavioral Psychology: It's Complicated.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "But I can't stand up cause o' muh knees."}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, I come from a family of obese people and when I was young and overweight, my mother took it upon herself to help my morbidly obese sister lose weight. For context, she was maybe 10 or 11 at the time and had a history of behaviors such as stealing food and secret eating (We have her on video at 2 years old, swiping my birthday cake while I opened gifts and once she stole a bag of cherries and ate the entire thing in the middle of the night, so it&amp;#39;s not merely limited to unhealthy stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite her best efforts, when my mom enrolled my sister in year long gym (as opposed to the requisite semester) and put her on the Atkins diet (which my parents adopted as well), my sister simply left her gym clothes behind somewhere so she didn&amp;#39;t have to participate and stole whatever foods she could get her hands on. And of course there was the issue of school lunches, which she&amp;#39;d simply steal money for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m not saying my sister&amp;#39;s behaviors are completely on her because as a psychology student, I understand they needed to be reinforced or at least not properly punished by my parents to be maintained. Especially for 10 years. But even though my sister was very much still a child without a clear understanding of the long term implications of her choices, she still made choices all the same. My mom couldn&amp;#39;t make my sister stick to being active or eating her altered diet, only she could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, the caveats of behavioral psychology make this a much more complex issue than I&amp;#39;m alluding to, but I just want to play devil&amp;#39;s advocate for the uneducated parents out there who aren&amp;#39;t necessarily acting (or rather, not acting) out of ignorance or apathy. Their child&amp;#39;s behaviors and subsequent decision making skills &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; their responsibility to model/encourage appropriately, but without education on their part, even the best of intentions can fall short. Plus, you have to keep in mind that those same parents are probably modeling what they learned from &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; parents so finger pointing only goes so far.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make another point, I am, as I mentioned, a child of an obese family. Yet when I was in high school, I learned about proper diet and exercise and took it upon myself to lose my excess weight. Granted, I was under my parents&amp;#39; authority while I was younger, but at a certain point that lessened and I possessed the autonomy to inform myself and change accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Behavioral Psychology: It&amp;#39;s Complicated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4zuhoh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/fatlogic/comments/4zuhoh/documentary_about_obesity_epidemic_and_why_it/d6z0kcn/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fatlogic/comments/4zuhoh/documentary_about_obesity_epidemic_and_why_it/", "name": "t1_d6z0kcn", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "author_flair_text": "But I can't stand up cause o' muh knees.", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1472320546.0, "created_utc": 1472320546.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fatlogic/comments/4zuhoh/documentary_about_obesity_epidemic_and_why_it/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How many chairs do you have to break before you realize your weight is a problem?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 9, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "fatlogic", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d6ywbnq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TheRealAlfredAdler", "num_comments": 142, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d6xz40c", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_doh9m", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Despite the lack of prevalence, even if 24000000 is correct and they have some sort of disorder affecting their coordination, my grandmother is in the same boat and she's actually *way* more cautious when standing and sitting because her motor issues put her at an absurdly high risk for falls as it is. \n\nIf someone has a motor disability, it's probably a lot safer to use caution when moving to avoid injury rather than adopt a \"fuckitmightaswellcollapseonthecouch\" attitude simply because any alternative would require more patience and effort.

The last thing those people are doing are &amp;quot;Eating to live.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4xly3i", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/fatlogic/comments/4xly3i/200000_years_of_humans_have_lived_without_diets/d6hfyh1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fatlogic/comments/4xly3i/200000_years_of_humans_have_lived_without_diets/", "name": "t1_d6hfyh1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatlogic", "author_flair_text": "But I can't stand up cause o' muh knees.", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1471206017.0, "created_utc": 1471206017.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://imgur.com/3IvkBio"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2wyxm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "This totally happened guys!", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 18, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "fatlogic", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d6hf7gd", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "TheRealAlfredAdler", "num_comments": 202, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d6h0bgc", "score": 18, "author_fullname": "t2_doh9m", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well, clearly she's a victim *and* modest.
