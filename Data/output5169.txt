The hope was that maybe he just had a severe stomach bug and had acute kidney injury and that by rehydrating him and giving him an appetite stimulant we could get him to eat and maybe it would be OK. Unfortunately, it's not looking to be the case.\n\nThe wonderful bastard is out in his warm spot with a heating blanket right now. We are coming out periodically to cuddle him and give him love and letting our other cat, Scootaloo, love on him when we aren't. He's pretty weak and hasn't touched his food. Not even his favorite, chicken. \n\nSo right now, the plan is to give him another load of fluid tonight and have him sleep with us tonight like he likes to. Who knows, maybe he might get up an appetite and we can keep him with us. But it's unfortunately gotta be said: he's getting weaker. If tomorrow shows no promising change then I think we will have to take him on a final ride. \n\nWhen we got Sips, we went to our local animal shelter on an old cat adoption day. We had seen the real guy on their website and realized he had been there for some time. When we came in and they asked if we had any particular preference who to see, we confirmed it by asking for their oldest cat. They took us out to their cat trailers and showed us the most beautiful grey and white cat. Yeah his face was a lil fucked up and his back legs looked very similar to Hank Hill's, but he was fucking fannnnntastic. They told us he came from a hoarder and that he's skittish...but he came right out to us and nuzzled and slobbered all over us. Apparently, a vet who worked with them had taken a liking to the guy and had postponed putting him down for a few months. She ran to meet us and gave us a big hug. We took him home right there.\n\nMy partner and I love Sips_ with a passion. Whether it's ripping dicks watching Don't Starve or screaming at Skyrim, Sips_ has been such a huge source of laughs and good times. So when we saw our cat and realized what an old bastard he was, Sips became his name.\n\nSips loves sitting in the window watching the world go by but overall was a big scaredy cat. Anyone came by or knocked on the door he'd run and hide. But over time, he got to be so loving and forceful for that love. He took to climbing into our bed (as his back legs were shot) and just getting right up in between us and maowing as loud as possible for pets. He'd wake up Ashton every morning for food. And he'd pal around with Scootaloo as if they were Bonnie and Clyde. And if you gave him a good scritch, he'd roll over and wrap your arm in his soft warm belly fur and demand belly rubs while splaying his skinny rear legs all over the place. Graceful he was not, but full of love and personality, just like the main man himself.\n\nSo, like I said, it's likely our journey with our Sips is coming to an end. Thank you you magnificent dick-rippers for being a wonderful community. And thank you Chris for being so goddamn wonderful to watch. While we aren't ready to say goodbye, at least we got to. Thank you for helping with that.\n\nI remain,\n\nDocFeelGood.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;#39;all, thanks to all who donated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m Ashton&amp;#39;s partner and I&amp;#39;m giving our Sips fluids subcutaneously once a day this weekend.

And he&amp;#39;d pal around with Scootaloo as if they were Bonnie and Clyde. And if you gave him a good scritch, he&amp;#39;d roll over and wrap your arm in his soft warm belly fur and demand belly rubs while splaying his skinny rear legs all over the place.

Thank you you magnificent dick-rippers for being a wonderful community. And thank you Chris for being so goddamn wonderful to watch. While we aren&amp;#39;t ready to say goodbye, at least we got to. Thank you for helping with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remain,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DocFeelGood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_490teq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/sips/comments/490teq/sips_the_cat_is_very_sick_and_needs_help_he_is_a/d0p1ble/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sips/comments/490teq/sips_the_cat_is_very_sick_and_needs_help_he_is_a/", "name": "t1_d0p1ble", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sips", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1457222494.0, "created_utc": 1457222494.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.youcaring.com/sips-the-cat-533368#"}}], "before": null}}
