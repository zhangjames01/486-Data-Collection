Two words that express a concept that it is somehow possible to pause life and then restart it whenever we feel like.  While there are [some](https://www.science.org.au/curious/earth-environment/animals-can-live-forever) animals that can potentially live forever, in practice only the very cute [tardigrades](https://invisiverse.wonderhowto.com/news/tardigrades-are-earths-toughest-almost-immortal-animals-0176752/) have a dormant state that can potentially 'live' forever.  How they achieve that remains a mystery.\n\nIn most animals, suspended animation equals death.  While is is [possible](https://www.livescience.com/51046-how-boy-survived-near-drowning.html) to survive for a long time under water in hypothermic conditions, most people die much more quickly than the 42 minutes that is the record to date and 42 minutes is at least 8 orders of magnitude too short for an interstellar trip.\n\nThe problem here is that we don't have a good handle on what \"alive\" means.  Look up any biology [textbook](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/what-is-biology/a/what-is-life) and you'll find lists of characteristics that living things have:\n\n* Organisation\n* Metabolism\n* Homeostasis\n* Growth\n* Reproduction\n* Response\n* Evolution\n\nYet half-competent biologist will be able to think of half a dozen exceptions to the above characteristics without even thinking. Let's explore some situations in humans that do occur:\n\n**Brain death** is used in many jurisdictions as the legal indicator of death but it is possible to keep the body alive and this is routinely done in the case where organs are to be harvested for transplant.  Currently we do not have the ability to restart the brain but, if it were possible, would brain dead people still be alive?  How do we even go about restarting the brain?\n\n**Clinical death** is often defined to be when the heart stops beating.  However, brain activity may [persist](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20181125/Human-brain-may-stay-active-for-hours-after-death.aspx) for hours afterwards and may resume normal function if the heart is restarted.  We are pretty comfortable with the idea that this state is reversible thanks to endless (and endlessly contrived) \"Just breath dammit!\" moments in film and TV.\n\n**Persistent vegetative state** is not commonly recognised as 'dead' because people can and have spontaneously recovered from it but the odds are against you the longer it goes on.\n\nSo we have to marry up our concept of suspended animation with one of the death states and we find that nothing is a good fit.  None of them can persist indefinitely and all of them rapidly reduce the chances of revival the longer they persist.  This indicates that we need a new state of death.  That state not only has to exist for ourselves but for all bacteria, parasites and viruses that may inhabit our bodies.  Otherwise the pausing of the immune system would lead to our suspended bodies rotting in their sleep chamber.\n\nAnd now we're back to the same problems as with **Breeder ships**.  We need to do experiments in order to safely kill organisms and then attempt to bring them back.  Failure here means you need to start the trail again with a new organism so it's best to do these trials in parallel.  Once again, no ethics committee in the world is going to authorise such experiments in anything more closely related to humans than probably mice so even if we do achieve the Nobel Prize-worthy feat of resurrecting a mouse, there is no guarantee it will work in humans.\n\nBut, for the sake of argument, let's say that we do somehow manage to overcome the impossible technical and ethical hurdles and create a machine that can pause a human and then restart that person.  What is the failure rate of that machine?  Even the most meticulously engineered machines fail and this capsule needs to function without human intervention for many centuries.  In other words, how many of the colonists can expect to die when we send them out into space this way?\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nNone of this addresses the MVP (minimum viable population) of humans.  A [recent](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-022-02456-z) study puts the figure at around 500-1000.  If you err too low then the entire colony is doomed so more is obviously better which has strong implications when you need to stack a ship full of people-sized stasis pods.\n\nOn top of all of this, how do we even survive on the new world.  Leaving aside that there may be life that would compete with us at all levels (from gigantic predators to soil bacteria that would kill our plants and everything in between), there is the problem of [chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)).  Humans, and all life on earth, has evolved to use right-handed sugars and left-handed proteins (D-sugars and L-proteins) but most researchers think that this was an accident.  Indeed, chemical processes that form sugars and proteins spontaneously generate a mix of left- and right-handed variants.  It is entirely possible that our brave new world simply does not have the right type of sugars and proteins in which case death by starvation would happen very quickly.\n\nTL:DR  Sleeper ships are even harder than breeder ships", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleeper ships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about suspended animation.

We need to do experiments in order to safely kill organisms and then attempt to bring them back.  Failure here means you need to start the trail again with a new organism so it&amp;#39;s best to do these trials in parallel.  Once again, no ethics committee in the world is going to authorise such experiments in anything more closely related to humans than probably mice so even if we do achieve the Nobel Prize-worthy feat of resurrecting a mouse, there is no guarantee it will work in humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, for the sake of argument, let&amp;#39;s say that we do somehow manage to overcome the impossible technical and ethical hurdles and create a machine that can pause a human and then restart that person.  What is the failure rate of that machine?  Even the most meticulously engineered machines fail and this capsule needs to function without human intervention for many centuries.  In other words, how many of the colonists can expect to die when we send them out into space this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this addresses the MVP (minimum viable population) of humans.  A &lt;a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-022-02456-z\"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; study puts the figure at around 500-1000.  If you err too low then the entire colony is doomed so more is obviously better which has strong implications when you need to stack a ship full of people-sized stasis pods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of all of this, how do we even survive on the new world.  Leaving aside that there may be life that would compete with us at all levels (from gigantic predators to soil bacteria that would kill our plants and everything in between), there is the problem of &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry\"&gt;chirality&lt;/a&gt;).  Humans, and all life on earth, has evolved to use right-handed sugars and left-handed proteins (D-sugars and L-proteins) but most researchers think that this was an accident.  Indeed, chemical processes that form sugars and proteins spontaneously generate a mix of left- and right-handed variants.  It is entirely possible that our brave new world simply does not have the right type of sugars and proteins in which case death by starvation would happen very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR  Sleeper ships are even harder than breeder ships&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zqqc5v", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/bestof/comments/zqqc5v/uzzepicsniper303zz_breaks_down_possible_ways/j122k6v/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/zqqc5v/uzzepicsniper303zz_breaks_down_possible_ways/", "name": "t1_j122k6v", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/bestof", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1671589720.0, "created_utc": 1671589720.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://reddit.com/r/space/comments/zq3snc/_/j0wnmhv/?context=1"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "u/zZEpicSniper303Zz breaks down possible ways humans could achieve interstellar space travel.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 16, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "bestof", "link_author": "spazzyalt", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j11uvuc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Klarok", "num_comments": 24, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_zqqc5v", "score": 16, "author_fullname": "t2_4sjkq", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Biologist here.  While I can't speak for what may happen centuries or millennia from now, there really is no plausible pathway from our current technology base to having the ability to make sleeper or seeder ships.\n\n**Seeder Ships**\n\nWhile you can [grow](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/08/did-japanese-students-really-hatch-a-chick-outside-a-shell.html) and perhaps even hatch a chicken in vitro, humans do not lay eggs ^[citation ^needed].  There is [evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14989529/) that parental age and birth order affect the sexual orientation of children which is a good indicator that trans-placental communication with the mother affects the maturation of the fetus (this is pretty obvious but it does need to be said).  Note that we do not know the extent and timing of any such communication.\n\nIn order to have seeder ships, we need **artificial wombs**.  To do that, we need to fully understand what resources the mother provides to the fetus and when those resources are necessary.  We do not currently understand this and it is almost certainly not as simple as providing nutrients and dialysis services to the embryo.  One line of evidence here is that the fetus preferentially takes resources from the mother (hence she will get cravings for certain foods) which could indicate some sort of signalling pathway between fetus and mother.\n\nTo develop artificial wombs, we're going to have to grow fetuses.  Most of them will die, especially in the early stages of research, and they will have to be carefully analysed against some sort of positive control ie. a healthy fetus at the same stage of development.  Fetuses take months to grow so it's probably best to try a whole bunch of them in parallel with corresponding positive controls (pregnant mothers) who are willing to give up their unborn children for science.  \n\nThere are so many ethical and moral red flags in what I just wrote that it's difficult to even know where to begin.  Suffice to say that it is inconceivable that such research would ever be given the green light even in the most repressive of totalitarian dictatorships.  Any similar research using other primates would be prohibited by every ethics committee.\n\nSo we're left with trying to grow fetuses of other mammals like mice.  Mice are good because they have a short (3 weeks ish) gestation period so you can get a lot of them very quickly.  Mice are bad because they are genetically about 90% similar to humans and clearly some of that difference lies in the reproductive cycle.  Still, if you manage to grow a live mouse *in vitro* then there is a committee in Stockholm who will be very pleased to have a word with you.\n\nBut, even if we manage to grow mice, we still need to do human trials starting with the same technology.  Which takes us back to an assembly line of fetal test tubes and mothers who are happy to donate their time and unborn children to science.\n\nCan't we do anything to skip this?\n\nNot really.  Currently we think that the human genome has around 20,000 genes but estimates vary up or down by thousands.  The fact that we have fully sequenced the human genome and we do not know how many genes we have is telling.  We don't know what most of those genes do and many of them have alternate configurations based on which exons are read during transcription.  Sorry, jargon, here is an explanation:\n\n* Gene - a sequence of DNA that encodes a protein that has some function.  Note that there are genes which do not encode proteins.  We don't know what they are for.\n* Transcription - the process of reading DNA to make messenger RNA (mRNA) that will go out of the nucleus and be translated into proteins\n* Exon - a portion of a gene that is actually read.  This is opposed to *introns* which are not read into mRNA.  Exons and introns alternate in genes and not every exon is read every time a gene is translated.\n\nFor the vast majority, we don't know what the genes do.  We don't know how many of them are switched off after neonatal development is complete but we do know that the switching off can involve DNA methylation.  On top of this, some genes have multiple functions which are location and/or time dependent during development.\n\nWe tend to figure out the function of genes by what is termed 'knockout' experiments.  That we breed a model creature that has a non-functional copy of a gene and see what happens.  For obvious reasons, we can't do this in humans so we have to look for natural examples of such.  It's how we figured out what causes cystic fibrosis and fatal familial insomnia.  As an example here, cystic fibrosis is caused by a single gene (CFTR) defect and causes problems in the lungs, pancreas, digestive system and reproductive system - one gene has many functions in different places in the body.\n\nBut an unknown number of genes are absolutely essential for life.  Errors in those genes will cause a miscarriage or stillbirth because the fetus never had a chance of developing.  We don't know how many or what those genes are and obviously we can't find natural examples in humans.\n\nSo we're stuck.  We need at least 5 major breakthroughs to progress this research towards being able to grow fetuses outside of the womb.\n\n1. We need to know the exact number of human genes\n2. We need to know what those genes encode (protein, signalling, other??? \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af)\n3. We need to know what any proteins look like.  [AlphaFold](https://www.aaas.org/news/sciences-2021-breakthrough-ai-powered-protein-prediction) is a very exciting breakthrough here but there is still much more to do.\n4. Having the structure, we may be able to predict the function for some proteins but certainly not all.  We need to know the function of all genes in human development\n5. With all that, we might be able to skip the messy and wasteful biological trials and design a system from the ground up.  I wouldn't hold my breath for any of that though, the gaps between steps 3 &amp; 4 and 4 &amp; 5 would require [miracles](http://www.ideacenter.org/stuff/contentmgr/files/e27b080d92450837e43d44bf73780847/misc/image5.gif} of science to bridge.\n\nAll of this barely scratches the surface though.  Fetal bones are space constrained so physical geometry has an impact on development.  Maternal sounds eg. heartbeat, voice etc, can impact development and the list goes on and on and on.  To be able to grow babies artificially, we need to know everything that affects their development which leads us back to the baby production and disassembly line.\n\nMore in the next post\n\nTL:DR Making babies artificially is mind-bogglingly difficult.", "edited": 1671587167.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologist here.
