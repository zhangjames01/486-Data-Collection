Aetherkhemist is ok, as is Endrinmaster with either loadout. Company Captains are also really good and really cheap if you just need another solid fighter to drop triples and buff your attacks. \n\nPreviously bringing an allied Tempest\u2019s Eye hero from Cities of Sigmar was almost mandatory, as it would let your cheap foot dwarves zoom across the map with up to 9\u201d moves for a triple.

The Old Guard (hero for Longbeards dwarves unit) is the most efficient option. \n\nTaking the Endrinriggers or Skywardens with long guns is really inefficient, as you\u2019re spending a ton of points on speed and flight and on meh shooting, and you end up really missing out on bodies and combat power. The basic Endrinriggers are ok, as are basic Skywardens, but you get more value from the heroes instead. And if you\u2019re wanting the long guns, Arkanauts are a much cheaper platform for the same guns, but Thunderers have better ones. \n\nGrundstok Thunderers can be decent, as all 4 special weapons can potentially be valuable. I wouldn\u2019t put any in an all-comers list personally, but Cannons can really wreak havoc on beefy enemies (especially if you can buff their attacks with a nearby hero triple), Mortars have solid midrange value though are very swingy, and Decksweeper/Fumigator are pretty efficient for ranged attacks. Rifles don\u2019t feel very good to me, and the Sarge is still ok but feels really weak compared to how good he was in 1.0 which has kind of turned me off using him since the new edition. I could see a lot of room to play around with adding some of these guys now after the Tempest\u2019s Eye nerf, and if I ever pick up more of them I may look into it as well. \n\nThundrik\u2019s squad is all decent too IIRC, the volley gun guy still uses the old volley gun statline which is crazy good, and the balloon guy is better than a normal Skywarden but I\u2019d still rather put those points into a Mizzenmaster or Endrinmaster with balloon. \n\nFor general listbuilding, you kinda wanna look at what each unit is good at and why you want them in your list. For a solid 1000 point list you\u2019ll wanna have some way to kill things that are in your way, and some way to grab and hold near and far objectives. Dragons, Titans, and to a lesser extent efficient chaff and midrange dudes do the first job primarily. Titans, shooters, and beefier chaff and midrange dudes do a good job at holding near objectives, while runners, faster chaff, and in a pinch dragons can grab far objectives. Support units are a category of their own, where their combat stats aren\u2019t as important as the abilities they give access to, but good stats are still nice to have there. \n\nKO specifically has good Dragons (fast hard hitters that can generally one-shot a chaff model and two-shot midrange models), really good chaff (sub-70 point models with above-average stats for the cost) and chaff+ (models slightly above that 70 point cutoff that still have good stats for the cost), and some solid ranged options with some manner of support for ranged attacks. Their midrange melee fighters are mostly meh, and they also have a lot of bad options too (for example all the 200ish point ranged units with flight and poor efficiency). They don\u2019t have any real Titans (big beefy units with really good melee efficiency and durability) and their runners aren\u2019t especially good either (no fast walkers and the regular balloons are a bit too expensive to let them just babysit an objective). \n\nThe ratio I have found most helpful for me in KO is 1-2 dragons, a support unit, and the rest chaff or chaff+, depending on how many points I have available. But other formulations can be successful too. You just need to make sure you aren\u2019t going too far in either the killing or objective grabbing direction to the point you can\u2019t contend in the other. \n\nKeep in mind you can ally in 1-2 heroes from the other Order warbands to fill any needs you\u2019re missing.

But the Dark Angels AoO was really rough on them, they have to pick either Deathwing or Ravenwing, or not get the bonuses for either. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the basic AoO building we currently get pretty punished, either mono obsession or RSR. Boarding Action allows for an RSR-lite with one of each troop type allowing each to get obsession and Archon to get the RSR Archon rules, to account for the 500 point and 1 HQ limitation making normal RSR impossible. But for basic AoO rules, currently our only way of keeping obsessions is to either go mono or do full RSR, meaning no Drazhar WL traits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1039oy0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Drukhari/comments/1039oy0/arks_of_omen/j3kr6to/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drukhari/comments/1039oy0/arks_of_omen/", "name": "t1_j3kr6to", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Drukhari", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1673243833.0, "created_utc": 1673243833.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Drukhari/comments/1039oy0/arks_of_omen/"}}], "before": null}}
