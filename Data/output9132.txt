I\u2019d have Joel bare fist fight all the infected I could to save on ammo and always save my bombs for the parts with multiple bloaters or clickers. When I had to kill FEDRA or bandits I was basically John Wick. The only time I would chuck a brick or bottle was to hit a dude in the head before I rushed them with an upgraded bat. \n\nIt just wasn\u2019t the same playing as Ellie. She\u2019s vicious but it just didn\u2019t make sense for her to Macho Man Randy Savage her way through the game so I had to play a lot sneakier. I upgraded my bow as much as I could and Katnissed my way through the game. The plot and cinematics were cool but it didn\u2019t hold my attention nearly as well. \n\nJoel becoming a Flanderized version of himself and murdering his way across the Western United States would have been awesome. The third game could have been Joel coming back to a destroyed Jackson, WY - a repercussion for his murderous rampage. Joel would just turn around and start murdering again.
