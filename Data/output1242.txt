can expect to fully understand from a Reddit thread).\n\nFirst, God is both loving *and just.* Most of God's attributes don't get a lot of press coverage, but *loving* is only one of many. Justice, sovereignty, holiness, and immutability are a handful of others, just to name a few. So keep in mind that, being just, God must hold people accountable to His laws. In the beginning, there was only one law-- \"Do not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\" But mankind muffed it. We ate. And justice had to be served. (Isaiah 61:8 [Old Testament] \"For I the Lord love justice; I hate robbery and wrong; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.\") Our perfect world where nothing bad ever happens was opened up to evil (we wanted it, we asked for it, so we got it). Holocausts, wars, murder, theft, sexual assault, bullying, gossip, selfishness, greed, anger, slavery, broken relationships, lies, and every other terrible thing you can think of all came into our perfect world. We fell out of fellowship with God, because He is holy and cannot abide sin. God's justice had to be satisfied. But that is not the end of the story!!\n\n\nSecond, God loves the world a *lot.* He loved the world and His creatures (that's us) so much that he made a way for man to be saved from His justice. (John 3:16-17 [New Testament a.k.a \"The Gospel\"] \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whosever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him.\")\n\nHow does that work?\n\nA process called \"Justification\" -- the action of declaring righteous in the sight of God. (Think Aslan taking Edmund's place in *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*) Jesus lived the perfect life we cannot live, and died the death that we cannot survive, so that we can be restored to a right relationship with God.\n\nThird, Jesus explained in His sermon on the Mount what makes the Old Testament different from the New Testament (this would be helpful for anyone to read since most people get confused about the OT/NT distinction), and I won't try to summarize it other than to cite this verse of His sermon: Matthew 5:17-18 [New Testament] \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.\"\n\nTL;DR: God is just and loving. He loves us enough that He gave us a way to satisfy His justice without being eternally punished for our own sin.\n\n\nNow - being honest with yourself - ask yourself the question, \"What kind of God would He be if He were not just?\"\nObviously you may take issue with some or all of God's standards/laws for man, but given that God does have standards, seriously consider-- what kind of God would He be if He didn't hold people accountable to the law? Not a trick question; it would make Him an un-just God. Would you prefer it if there was no justice promised for the wrongs you see in the world around you? I doubt it. But thankfully, God can be both just (punish us for sin, like driving cars through crowds of people) and loving (forgive us for our sin if we repent and trust that we are justified through Jesus) at the same time.\n\nThere's my feeble attempt to explain the immutability (un-changing-ness) of God between the Old Testament and the New Testament.

In the beginning, there was only one law-- &amp;quot;Do not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&amp;quot; But mankind muffed it. We ate. And justice had to be served. (Isaiah 61:8 [Old Testament] &amp;quot;For I the Lord love justice; I hate robbery and wrong; I will faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.&amp;quot;) Our perfect world where nothing bad ever happens was opened up to evil (we wanted it, we asked for it, so we got it). Holocausts, wars, murder, theft, sexual assault, bullying, gossip, selfishness, greed, anger, slavery, broken relationships, lies, and every other terrible thing you can think of all came into our perfect world. We fell out of fellowship with God, because He is holy and cannot abide sin. God&amp;#39;s justice had to be satisfied. But that is not the end of the story!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, God loves the world a &lt;em&gt;lot.&lt;/em&gt; He loved the world and His creatures (that&amp;#39;s us) so much that he made a way for man to be saved from His justice. (John 3:16-17 [New Testament a.k.a &amp;quot;The Gospel&amp;quot;] &amp;quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whosever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How does that work?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A process called &amp;quot;Justification&amp;quot; -- the action of declaring righteous in the sight of God. (Think Aslan taking Edmund&amp;#39;s place in &lt;em&gt;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&lt;/em&gt;) Jesus lived the perfect life we cannot live, and died the death that we cannot survive, so that we can be restored to a right relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, Jesus explained in His sermon on the Mount what makes the Old Testament different from the New Testament (this would be helpful for anyone to read since most people get confused about the OT/NT distinction), and I won&amp;#39;t try to summarize it other than to cite this verse of His sermon: Matthew 5:17-18 [New Testament] &amp;quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: God is just and loving. He loves us enough that He gave us a way to satisfy His justice without being eternally punished for our own sin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now - being honest with yourself - ask yourself the question, &amp;quot;What kind of God would He be if He were not just?&amp;quot;\nObviously you may take issue with some or all of God&amp;#39;s standards/laws for man, but given that God does have standards, seriously consider-- what kind of God would He be if He didn&amp;#39;t hold people accountable to the law? Not a trick question; it would make Him an un-just God. Would you prefer it if there was no justice promised for the wrongs you see in the world around you? I doubt it. But thankfully, God can be both just (punish us for sin, like driving cars through crowds of people) and loving (forgive us for our sin if we repent and trust that we are justified through Jesus) at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s my feeble attempt to explain the immutability (un-changing-ness) of God between the Old Testament and the New Testament. He&amp;#39;s the same God with the same attributes and the same character qualities, but the present time is later in the story-arc of redemption than our ancestors in the book of I Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_6tg0k2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/pics/comments/6tg0k2/this_sign_is_outside_my_local_church_think_its_a/dlko8i2/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6tg0k2/this_sign_is_outside_my_local_church_think_its_a/", "name": "t1_dlko8i2", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pics", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1502655828.0, "created_utc": 1502655828.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/cxeap44s6jfz.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2x93b", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Pottery wheel art, so satisfying...", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 22, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "oddlysatisfying", "link_author": "amandapandabear", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dliatc3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "DownvotingSpartan", "num_comments": 40, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_6t2uxp", "score": 22, "author_fullname": "t2_7fb6q", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you enjoy watching this gif, you're gonna love [kaleidoscope drawing](http://www.drawerings.com/draw.php).", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy watching this gif, you&amp;#39;re gonna love &lt;a href=\"http://www.drawerings.com/draw.php\"&gt;kaleidoscope drawing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_6t2uxp", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/6t2uxp/pottery_wheel_art_so_satisfying/dliatc3/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/6t2uxp/pottery_wheel_art_so_satisfying/", "name": "t1_dliatc3", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/oddlysatisfying", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1502512423.0, "created_utc": 1502512423.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://i.imgur.com/UwVCDpk.gifv"}}], "before": null}}
