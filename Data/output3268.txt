Yes, many of those programs include huge amounts of money to things that also benefit foreign populations, but at the end of the day, it's because for one policy reason or another, it benefits the United States and its people. If you aren't comfortable being an agent of the government of the United States, then different work might better suit you. You aren't asked to turn a blind eye to the rest of the world, but you don't get to focus on the rest of the world at the expense of the United States, either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I think on balance this would probably be a career that I'd occasionally feel guilty about, and that can't be construed as being as altruistic as, say, a lawyer working on housing rights or something, but that helps more than it hurts, and could be justified as being a net positive on an individual level even if institution it is representing could not.\n\nI think you might be overestimating, frankly, the impact any given individual \u2060\u2014 on average \u2060\u2014 has in any type of organization. Beyond that, though, you have to decide the path that builds the life you want. What kind of person do you want to be? How do you want to define yourself? You need to figure that out before you can decide. I know people who want to raise the best family they can, and the job they have is only to support that goal. They're content across sectors and types of work. I know people who value academic pursuit or private sector title advancement or any number of other things \u2060\u2014 and they find career paths accordingly. Do you want to \"do good in the world\" or do you want to \"serve the United States and its people\" or do you want to \"travel and see the world\" or...? Some of that aligns better with the FS, and some of it doesn't, despite what people romanticize about the job. Government work isn't for everyone, regardless of whether it's domestic or abroad. Consider that as well!\n\nYou asked if I'm proud of what I do. Yes, when I look in the macro, I am. But on a daily basis, a lot of what I do is either very mundane (emails, virtual meetings, demarches, coordinating guest lists for events, writing products on someone else's whim) or very niche to my current portfolio or job (not many people understand the unnecessary angst about the logistics, for example, of getting from the motorcade to some separate site because you have to do XYZ). But in the macro sense, I can point to a few things I've written or reported that made it into important conversations, albeit briefly. Or projects I led that netted real amounts of money moving places or commitments entering into force. I can also think of a handful of times that my over dedication to not leaving contacts hanging has demonstrably changed their attitude toward not only my office but my country, and so in these small ways that won't change history, I know my service and my work has mattered in its context and in its time. If that isn't enough for you, you have to either hope you are among the fraction of a percent that reaches objective greatness or you have to find another path.\n\nGood luck. You don't need all the answers to start moving in a direction in life, but likewise, don't stop searching for answers once you start going.

Yes, many of those programs include huge amounts of money to things that also benefit foreign populations, but at the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s because for one policy reason or another, it benefits the United States and its people. If you aren&amp;#39;t comfortable being an agent of the government of the United States, then different work might better suit you. You aren&amp;#39;t asked to turn a blind eye to the rest of the world, but you don&amp;#39;t get to focus on the rest of the world at the expense of the United States, either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think on balance this would probably be a career that I&amp;#39;d occasionally feel guilty about, and that can&amp;#39;t be construed as being as altruistic as, say, a lawyer working on housing rights or something, but that helps more than it hurts, and could be justified as being a net positive on an individual level even if institution it is representing could not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you might be overestimating, frankly, the impact any given individual \u2060\u2014 on average \u2060\u2014 has in any type of organization. Beyond that, though, you have to decide the path that builds the life you want. What kind of person do you want to be? How do you want to define yourself? You need to figure that out before you can decide. I know people who want to raise the best family they can, and the job they have is only to support that goal. They&amp;#39;re content across sectors and types of work. I know people who value academic pursuit or private sector title advancement or any number of other things \u2060\u2014 and they find career paths accordingly. Do you want to &amp;quot;do good in the world&amp;quot; or do you want to &amp;quot;serve the United States and its people&amp;quot; or do you want to &amp;quot;travel and see the world&amp;quot; or...? Some of that aligns better with the FS, and some of it doesn&amp;#39;t, despite what people romanticize about the job. Government work isn&amp;#39;t for everyone, regardless of whether it&amp;#39;s domestic or abroad. Consider that as well!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You asked if I&amp;#39;m proud of what I do. Yes, when I look in the macro, I am. But on a daily basis, a lot of what I do is either very mundane (emails, virtual meetings, demarches, coordinating guest lists for events, writing products on someone else&amp;#39;s whim) or very niche to my current portfolio or job (not many people understand the unnecessary angst about the logistics, for example, of getting from the motorcade to some separate site because you have to do XYZ). But in the macro sense, I can point to a few things I&amp;#39;ve written or reported that made it into important conversations, albeit briefly. Or projects I led that netted real amounts of money moving places or commitments entering into force. I can also think of a handful of times that my over dedication to not leaving contacts hanging has demonstrably changed their attitude toward not only my office but my country, and so in these small ways that won&amp;#39;t change history, I know my service and my work has mattered in its context and in its time. If that isn&amp;#39;t enough for you, you have to either hope you are among the fraction of a percent that reaches objective greatness or you have to find another path.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck.
