All the things we said about Randle not having a true PG until Brunson applies to Lavine, who only had good teammates for 4 months before everyone got hurt. He's averaging 25/5/4 on 48/38/85 shooting. His team is terrible and he's still efficiently chugging along, creating offense for himself. He makes poor decisions defensively that get posted as lowlight reels, but if you watch him all game he's about average. The advanced stats back that up, though defensive advanced stats are pretty flawed.  He's got great size and athleticism, and can be taught defense imo. He's only missed 3 games this season, and by age he fits right in with Brunson and Randle. \n\n\n\nYou're paying to upgrade the RJ spot. When you look at it from that perspective, it costs 20 mil more a year to have Lavine. Even though it's only a 5 PPG difference between them and I think RJ still has crazy potential, Lavine is so much more efficient and his shot profile is so much better as a fit here that I'd still do the trade. Even with Lavines injury concerns. Costwise, the average yearly value for Lavine/Brunson/Randle/Mitch will be around 115 mil. I actually think that's okay. Sign backup wings/guards in FA, and then go over the cap to re-sign IQ and Hart. \n\n\n\nI'm a bigger fan of Lavine than others, so I understand if others don't want to do the trade.
