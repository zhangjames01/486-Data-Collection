The denialism certainly would make sense, but most zombie movies start after this has happened.\n\nTake a great example, the origin of it all: The Night of the Living Dead. The characters have a few choices, they could run outside (there were few zombies and are slow) but this is hard, and not everyone is going to be able to keep up (first night, the idea of leaving someone behind is not easy yet). They could go to the basement and block the door, but once that door is down they're doomed. Alternatively they could go upstairs and lock themselves there, the advantage is that if they zombies come in, they can run out the window. The characters do the obvious thing: reinforce the barn, and then if needed they can escape to the other plans. But the reinforcement brings in more zombies, and ends up being a mistake. The other plans were just as bad, but we the audience know that the cavalry gets there the next day, so it would have been better to hide it. Running may seem like a good choice, but had they simply hidden they probably wouldn't have attracted zombies. Now the plan to reinforce isn't that bad, but the characters screw each other in believable ways. Even in the end the sole survivor gets shot, mistaken for a zombie by the cavalry, who knows if they would have saved anyone.\n\nAnd that's the thing, the mistakes are believable, and you could see why the characters would do it in high stress.

It had a visual tone similar to Black Mirror and was set in the UK. The whole thing was set up as a zombie apocalypse, and our character is basically trying to escape and go to a safe place, at the same time they avoid the military which seems to be doing violent executions and what not. Our protagonist struggles and escapes to live one more day. Turns out that the whole thing was an exercise, a simulation, and no real pandemic had hit, they had simulated how well they'd be able to contain it if such scenario happened, and it turns out that our hero was infected but asymptomatic in the exercise, failing the whole thing. Basically any attempt to control and manage the disease would get people paranoid and they'd always find a way to escape, just enough to keep the contagion going. Here though the government wasn't pulling any stops in trying to control things (they were executing people, but isolating them for quarantine and separating them to prevent spreading when possible) and the actions of everyone was believable.\n\nIn 28 Days Later it works because we don't see a lot of the things, it's easy to imagine a pandemic that overruns the entire island before any organized movement is able to happen. The characters are merely trying to survive, and their actions make sense in that view. In 28 Weeks later the problem is two-fold, we are both shown too much and not enough to convince us. It shows us enough for us to see how things could get that bad, but it fails to show us a good enough justification to have there, you can kind of make it up for them, but it doesn't feel right, it doesn't show you this is happening, so it's hard to justify the mistakes of people. It feels that characters, government, the system to handle a disease known to bring down civilization, all had to have serious flaws so that the characters could actually survive and we could get to the end, basically characters and story in serving of the plot. There's no reason to think that, if they were able to stop the disease from making it to the continent the first time, they wouldn't be able to the next time.

I'd certainly can see a movie where we see zombie deniers and conspiracy believers, people who redefine the disease (honestly I'd love a movie where it turns out that you can easily cure the zombie disease, as long as the damage received during zombie mode isn't too bad, what a plot twist on what characters should or shouldn't do, and of course no one believing it) to whatever they want, death cults that seek self-destruction. Basically people descending into madness as they try to embrace the end of humanity due to a disease, a kind of existential/cosmic-horror realization that all humanity would face in seeing how frail we are. I'd see people being selfish, and being self-centered (making decisions that are bad for them, because they can't imagine someone else 1-step beyond them).

The only way to avoid this is to not have investment, which means they aren't making any money, but then why exist at all as a business?\n\nLets talk about what book value is. Book value is how much you planned to sell an asset for. Generally when you can sell this asset it becomes mature. Now some assets are risky, for example if I invest on the stock market, I can estimate how long it'll take to mature, but there's a possibility it'll take longer (if I have to weather a market correction, or the company under-performs), there's a possibility it won't make it at all (if the company I own goes under before that happens, or if it goes private and pays me less than I planned to get for that stock). Government bonds are highly safe because the US government has, until recently, always been amazing at paying what they say they will (we'll see what happens if the house effectively forces a default, but that's another story for another day).\n\nSo whenever you have to sell assets before maturation, you're selling them at a loss.\n\nNow lets talk about businesses and losses: it happens. A business that cannot handle that won't live long. Same with banks, selling assets at a loss is just something that happens. What you do is manage this as risk, you plan ahead. Thing is you have to plan within reason. I mean no one has a plan for the US having 1000% inflation tomorrow, its a risk, just not a reasonable one. To a bank having everyone take all their money out at the same time is not a reasonable risk: they'd be going out of business either way, so why plan to stay solvent when you go out of business either way?\n\nThere's no evidence that SVB had their assets worth less overall just because they sold some assets. Arguing that this is evidence enough is a bit of a stretch. There's no reason (unless there was some insider info going on) to not think that SVB could not survive with their remaining assets by waiting for them to mature. The panic, as far as can be seen, is unwarranted. To assume that the investors have to have a better reason and cannot have been panicking on not understanding the basics of market is easily disproved by seeing how tech has been doing in the last 6 months.\n\nThe irony is that Foundersfund was a sell-fulfilling prediction. They said: if we all pulled our money, the bank would be insolvent, so we should all pull our money! But this was an obvious thing that is true for all banks out there.

Now selling an asset at a loss, in a bank, is just another Thursday, it happens, and doesn't mean anything.

This scenario requires people to panic severely and then, in a frenzied mob, go and shoot themselves in the foot. Basically see the hand that feeds you take a single bit of food for itself, and in panic, bite it back.

Or was this all there was? Will reason and sensibility come to head as people realize that this was a one-off on a unique bank, on a unique, currently struggling, sector of the economy, under unique constraints, or will people keep suspecting this will be? And will investors and VC-funds realize in panic they've hurt themselves deeply in the medium term, and start another round of panics trying to make someone else pay for their mistakes? They've already been doing this for months, will this be the moment they stop think and realize that they can't fix the problem they've made for themselves, they can only accept it as is or make it worse?

Leadership generally should understand how all of these connect. You can ask questions about:\n\n\n* What is the current greater strategy and goals? What are the things that leadership is doing, or pushing to get there? What are the biggest challenges the company is struggling right now?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* This can give you insight about what are going to be the next things you'll be working on, and you can begin to learn.\n\n* What is going to be the plan the rest of the year? What about the next 5 years?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Leadership generally has a longer term plan than just Q, and then they decide each Q what they will do as they approach the greater goal. This is useful for your career. For example if there's a push for more reliability in the following year, you can start taking projects related to improving reliability of the code (increase code coverage, etc). If you become the expert in that area you can be given big challenges that come from this greater desire in that area.\n\n* How does your Project/Product currently fit in? What are the expectations that leadership has on your P? What are the expectations of your team? What are the biggest challenges that your product is facing right now.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* This one helps for your career. When you want to talk about \"impact\" it's about how you helped the greater goal happen. Sometimes the big issue is not what you'd expect, even if you get code coverage to 80% it's a failure if profits don't increase 20%. Sometimes leadership can't see how the obvious problem is a problem in their terms, put it in those terms and you can be one of those mythological engineers who gets promoted just for paying down technical debt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Also should help you realize if your team is doing something that isn't their job. Just like when you find out that you are doing great work that's critical for the company, [but not your job, so you can't get promoted](https://noidea.dog/glue). Your team may be working on things that aren't their job, even though they are important. Getting leadership aware of this work that needs to be done means they'll actually make it someone's job. It can also help you realize which projects, as useful as they may be, are not going to be beneficial for your career.\n\n* What are the current priorities and things that matter for the company? What are the next big steps?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* A senior engineer needs to be able to identify when they're given a crappy project. Sometimes the solution is to refuse to work on it and let it fester on the floor, other times it's to push back and get the project redefined or revisit the entire problem it's solving to do something else. Knowing when to do each can separate a good engineer from an amazing one (on their way to staff). The way you can know which to do? Realize what the priorities are.\n\n\n### What lays outside\n\n\nSenior leadership is having these meetings with other teams and interacting with them. When a team reuses another's work, the author gets extra impact on their work, and whoever got the work of someone else gets a lot of impact for little work.\n\n\n\n* What other teams share a lot with your current one? What teams could benefit from exchanging or cooperating?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* A good hint at which team's work you may want to look at to see if there's anything to learn or reuse from them. Similarly someone you can sell your already done solutions for problems they have, leading to great ways to have someone else's work also increase your impact.\n\n* You can ask about general problems (how do I make other devs get into the culture of writing tests for new code? What are ways to break tech debt when tech debt prevents releasing even fixes to the tech debt, etc). How have other teams they've seen fixed them? What are good references?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Gives you a good view of what to read on, or who to talk to if you feel lost with a big meaty problem, or the whole team is struggling with an issue with no obvious quick fix.\n\n* What are the current expectations on teams like yours? Especially if your team focuses on a specific aspect that many other product/projects have.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* This question is great for the product. Realizing that you're in a P that is struggling can let you see why she then understand when they ask for things that would seem reasonable but may be really hard to do (especially if there's tech debt).\n\n* What are similar teams/projects/products struggling with right now? What is the biggest gap they see across the board currently?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Again this let's you realize that working on a project and then sharing it might be useful. Guess what: if another product uses your solution to solve their problem you get to show impact across multiple projects, and good leadership to have vision beyond just your scope.\n\n\n---\n\n\nTake this more as an inspiration on what kind of questions to have and what mindset you may want to use when thinking on what to ask.

The thing is, be aware of which of the questions that pertain to you are questions they can answer. They won&amp;#39;t be able to answer questions about your day-to-day or specific technical challenges you are dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Strategic&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think of the whole company as a river flowing in one direction (it&amp;#39;s current goal as a whole), then each product/project is like a tributary feeding it, and the work you and your team (depending on how many people work on your current P) are like eddies within that tributary. Leadership generally should understand how all of these connect. You can ask questions about:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What is the current greater strategy and goals? What are the things that leadership is doing, or pushing to get there?

What about the next 5 years?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Leadership generally has a longer term plan than just Q, and then they decide each Q what they will do as they approach the greater goal. This is useful for your career. For example if there&amp;#39;s a push for more reliability in the following year, you can start taking projects related to improving reliability of the code (increase code coverage, etc). If you become the expert in that area you can be given big challenges that come from this greater desire in that area.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How does your Project/Product currently fit in? What are the expectations that leadership has on your P? What are the expectations of your team? What are the biggest challenges that your product is facing right now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* This one helps for your career.
