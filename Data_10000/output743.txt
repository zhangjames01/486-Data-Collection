Maybe you&amp;#39;ll have trouble with an actually &lt;em&gt;niche&lt;/em&gt; programming language, but that&amp;#39;s not Elixir. If you put in the work to learn Elixir, play with some projects, and get a well rounded familiarity with the tooling: you will get a job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference with Elixir is you will have access to a different category of opportunities because you won&amp;#39;t be competing with the masses of Javascript/Python developers. You&amp;#39;re gonna be early to a fast growing ecosystem and in a few years you&amp;#39;ll have more years of experience under your belt and it&amp;#39;ll be a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe if you&amp;#39;re really green you&amp;#39;ve gotta take what you can get for whatever programming experience you can manage, but its really not that far away of tinkering with these tools before you&amp;#39;re hire-able.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_wsd65i", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/elixir/comments/wsd65i/deleted_by_user/ikydv7g/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/wsd65i/deleted_by_user/", "name": "t1_ikydv7g", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elixir", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1660927591.0, "created_utc": 1660927591.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/wsd65i/deleted_by_user/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vhb3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Map.new/2 is objectively superior", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 15, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "elixir", "link_author": "dipittydoop", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ikpqon0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "dipittydoop", "num_comments": 7, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wr186u", "score": 15, "author_fullname": "t2_5u2c9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.13.4/Map.html#new/2\n\nYou're welcome.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.13.4/Map.html#new/2\"&gt;https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.13.4/Map.html#new/2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_wr186u", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/elixir/comments/wr186u/mapnew2_is_objectively_superior/ikpqon0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/wr186u/mapnew2_is_objectively_superior/", "name": "t1_ikpqon0", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/elixir", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1660773037.0, "created_utc": 1660773037.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.imgflip.com/6q9zul.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwed", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[deleted by user]", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Utah", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ikevhv4", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "dipittydoop", "num_comments": 129, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_wp5j9e", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5u2c9", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "It'd be a massive near trillion dollar scale project.
