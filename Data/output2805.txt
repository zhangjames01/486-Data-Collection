For this reason I agree with the other comments you are getting, that it is not as simple as the quote above.\n\nMen tend to be either powerful on their own merits, or not. They will cooperate, but each wields his own overt social value. In contrast, women tend to have social power and value *as a collective.* This makes sense since each woman has innate value for the same evolutionary reason (being a woman, bearing the children), so there is much less variance among female value than among male value. \n\nSure, the fit girl gets more leverage than the fat girl, but both still count as valuable in the eyes of society. The difference between the top girl and the bottom girl is less large than the top man and the bottom man. When society sees that \"our girls (valuable reproductive agents) need something\", then that is important, period.\n\nFemale adolescence is all about discovering your power (suddenly you can influence all these grown men that you looked up to so much), and then discovering that unfortunately, all the other girls in class have that same power. So girls learn that they cannot use their power freely, unless they are the only girl in a particular group. They are always constrained by the other girls.\n\nWhen a social group perceives that \"the women\" as a collective are in some kind of need, this will be a [powerful driving force for action](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/63m0z3/how_can_us_men_compete_with_this_gynocentrism/dfwgtus/?context=3). But when Angela says \"we need men to open doors for us\" and Betty says \"we need men to stop opening doors for us\", then the social group dismisses it as female hysterics / an internal quarrel that is best left ignored.\n\nSo the collective of women has an unspoken rule that any hint of overt disagreement should be avoided, as it weakens *every* woman's influence.

For this reason I agree with the other comments you are getting, that it is not as simple as the quote above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Men tend to be either powerful on their own merits, or not. They will cooperate, but each wields his own overt social value. In contrast, women tend to have social power and value &lt;em&gt;as a collective.&lt;/em&gt; This makes sense since each woman has innate value for the same evolutionary reason (being a woman, bearing the children), so there is much less variance among female value than among male value. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure, the fit girl gets more leverage than the fat girl, but both still count as valuable in the eyes of society. The difference between the top girl and the bottom girl is less large than the top man and the bottom man. When society sees that &amp;quot;our girls (valuable reproductive agents) need something&amp;quot;, then that is important, period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Female adolescence is all about discovering your power (suddenly you can influence all these grown men that you looked up to so much), and then discovering that unfortunately, all the other girls in class have that same power. So girls learn that they cannot use their power freely, unless they are the only girl in a particular group. They are always constrained by the other girls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a social group perceives that &amp;quot;the women&amp;quot; as a collective are in some kind of need, this will be a &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/63m0z3/how_can_us_men_compete_with_this_gynocentrism/dfwgtus/?context=3\"&gt;powerful driving force for action&lt;/a&gt;. But when Angela says &amp;quot;we need men to open doors for us&amp;quot; and Betty says &amp;quot;we need men to stop opening doors for us&amp;quot;, then the social group dismisses it as female hysterics / an internal quarrel that is best left ignored.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the collective of women has an unspoken rule that any hint of overt disagreement should be avoided, as it weakens &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; woman&amp;#39;s influence. Instead, Angela will avoid direct contradiction of Betty by saying &amp;quot;men are not respecting women because they are not chivalrous&amp;quot; and Betty will say &amp;quot;men are not respecting women as independent equals&amp;quot;. Now they appear to agree (men are disrespecting women) and this gives both of them the leverage of apparent herd support when they need to invoke that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an individual woman, the battle is then to make the female herd push &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; agenda, but this must be achieved without overt conflict.

It's quite generalizing in multiple ways.\n\nBut the main problem is that you're not concrete about it. Have another look at what you wrote:\n\n* Define \"boys\" (what ages? back when I read your title, it still included \"men\") \n\n* Define \"not comfortable\" (when does something cross that territory? what exactly do they do that makes you conclude this? what evidence do you have that your conclusion is the right one?) \n\n* Define \"women\" (what ages? is it on purpose that you use the childlike word \"boys\" which contrasts strongly with the adult word \"women\", or did you not intentionally create that contrast?)\n\n* What do \"sexual tensions\" have to do with it, when I didn't even mention any such thing in my posts? (So why are you mentioning it in your replies to me? Where exactly is the connection in your mind?) \n\n* What do you mean with \"engaging\" concretely?\n\n* Which \"differences between the sexes\"? There are plenty, and not all are problematic, and they don't only go in one direction, and they always exist in some sort of context which you do not specify.\n\n* You say it \"might help\" - it might help accomplish what exactly? Solve some sort of problem? (If yes: define what that problem is about and who thinks it is a problem?) Is this \"help\" needed and/or wanted, by which parties exactly, and what for?\n\nAgain, I am not the only commenter to point out this vagueness.

I'm sure that's not really what you are trying to say...", "edited": 1455748234.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason I&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;flogged it to death&amp;quot; is because unfortunately, your point is just all over the place, so I feel the need to be very clear and spell everything out to make sure there is absolutely 0 potential for any miscommunication or ambiguity on my end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry, but that&amp;#39;s just what it is - you&amp;#39;re not being univocal about what it is that you want to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;yet the point still remains that a lot of boys aren&amp;#39;t comfortable with women, and not just for reasons of sexual tensions. Just engaging with the differences between the sexes might help. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once again, this is vague. I (and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/468lj3/can_men_or_boys_be_taught_how_to_socialise_with/d035wuf\"&gt;other commenters&lt;/a&gt; with me) do not necessarily agree with that blanket statement. It&amp;#39;s quite generalizing in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the main problem is that you&amp;#39;re not concrete about it. Have another look at what you wrote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; (what ages? back when I read your title, it still included &amp;quot;men&amp;quot;) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define &amp;quot;not comfortable&amp;quot; (when does something cross that territory? what exactly do they do that makes you conclude this? what evidence do you have that your conclusion is the right one?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define &amp;quot;women&amp;quot; (what ages? is it on purpose that you use the childlike word &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; which contrasts strongly with the adult word &amp;quot;women&amp;quot;, or did you not intentionally create that contrast?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do &amp;quot;sexual tensions&amp;quot; have to do with it, when I didn&amp;#39;t even mention any such thing in my posts? (So why are you mentioning it in your replies to me? Where exactly is the connection in your mind?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you mean with &amp;quot;engaging&amp;quot; concretely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which &amp;quot;differences between the sexes&amp;quot;? There are plenty, and not all are problematic, and they don&amp;#39;t only go in one direction, and they always exist in some sort of context which you do not specify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You say it &amp;quot;might help&amp;quot; - it might help accomplish what exactly? Solve some sort of problem? (If yes: define what that problem is about and who thinks it is a problem?) Is this &amp;quot;help&amp;quot; needed and/or wanted, by which parties exactly, and what for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I am not the only commenter to point out this vagueness. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/468lj3/can_men_or_boys_be_taught_how_to_socialise_with/d03d0ux\"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/468lj3/can_men_or_boys_be_taught_how_to_socialise_with/d036b2q\"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/468lj3/can_men_or_boys_be_taught_how_to_socialise_with/d039s1f\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; Do you at least recognize why we are asking you to be more concrete?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; You say &amp;quot;the point remains&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s really not clear what the point actually entails.
