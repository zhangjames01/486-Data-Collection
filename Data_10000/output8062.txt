I like the school and I am glad I decided on this one, even if it is a \"larger\" law school (about 1200 students total), it really doesn't feel like a large school. It is pricey, current tuition is $42,000 per year but I suggest you visit the campus and get a feel for it. I think the best school is the one where you are comfortable, law school takes up A LOT of your time and you will practically live in the library come finals. Visit all the schools you want to apply to and spend a day there while classes are in session, and if you're brave enough, talk to some of the students and ask about their experiences. Good luck with all your applications!

I like the school and I am glad I decided on this one, even if it is a &amp;quot;larger&amp;quot; law school (about 1200 students total), it really doesn&amp;#39;t feel like a large school. It is pricey, current tuition is $42,000 per year but I suggest you visit the campus and get a feel for it. I think the best school is the one where you are comfortable, law school takes up A LOT of your time and you will practically live in the library come finals.
