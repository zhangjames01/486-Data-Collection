Article 1 of the Chinese constitution under Mao explicitly stated \"China is a dictatorship of the proletariat,\" which, just like Khrushchev, was immediately taken down and removed when the revisionists took power (and now China promotes \"Common Prosperity\" which is the same is essence as the \"State of the Whole People\").  \n\n&gt;What's more likely, that every socialist revolution that liberalized parts of their economy has coincidentally gone revisionist, or that the material conditions of these countries forced them to abandon central planning as too inefficient until better technology for such planning has come along?\n\nThis is the real curse of revisionism -- neoliberalism supplants Marxism and even self-proclaimed \"Marxists\" utterly fail and abandon even defending the most fundamental and necessary components of Marxism and Marxist history.  Not only were the collective farms in China *more efficient!,* (as is all central planning under all circumstances, something Marxists are *required to defend,* but socialism was achievable over a hundred years ago, we don't need an even better excel spreadsheet before it can be implemented today) but this was also the era in history where [China actually began it's exponential growth and development,](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*Vjl8QW0eY9ONiy2I) and none of it's capitalist success would have been achieved if this era did not so rapidly advance one of the most backwards places on Earth.  Communists need to seek truth, not comfort, and actual socialism is in a very difficult position in the world system today, and socialists need to be honest about this instead of retreating to the delusion that China is still socialist and will save them.

Article 1 of the Chinese constitution under Mao explicitly stated &amp;quot;China is a dictatorship of the proletariat,&amp;quot; which, just like Khrushchev, was immediately taken down and removed when the revisionists took power (and now China promotes &amp;quot;Common Prosperity&amp;quot; which is the same is essence as the &amp;quot;State of the Whole People&amp;quot;).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more likely, that every socialist revolution that liberalized parts of their economy has coincidentally gone revisionist, or that the material conditions of these countries forced them to abandon central planning as too inefficient until better technology for such planning has come along?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the real curse of revisionism -- neoliberalism supplants Marxism and even self-proclaimed &amp;quot;Marxists&amp;quot; utterly fail and abandon even defending the most fundamental and necessary components of Marxism and Marxist history.  Not only were the collective farms in China &lt;em&gt;more efficient!,&lt;/em&gt; (as is all central planning under all circumstances, something Marxists are &lt;em&gt;required to defend,&lt;/em&gt; but socialism was achievable over a hundred years ago, we don&amp;#39;t need an even better excel spreadsheet before it can be implemented today) but this was also the era in history where &lt;a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*Vjl8QW0eY9ONiy2I\"&gt;China actually began it&amp;#39;s exponential growth and development,&lt;/a&gt; and none of it&amp;#39;s capitalist success would have been achieved if this era did not so rapidly advance one of the most backwards places on Earth.  Communists need to seek truth, not comfort, and actual socialism is in a very difficult position in the world system today, and socialists need to be honest about this instead of retreating to the delusion that China is still socialist and will save them.  This notion is what doomed the Indonesian and Brazilian communists (who trusted the revisionist Khrushchev telling them to participate in elections and wait for the USSR to develop more, while Mao was telling that they needed to arm themselves and fight).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11toej8", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DebateCommunism/comments/11toej8/peter_singer_marx_was_a_philosopher_of_freedom_he/jcvdogk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/11toej8/peter_singer_marx_was_a_philosopher_of_freedom_he/", "name": "t1_jcvdogk", "author_flair_template_id": "ec69fa5c-3912-11e2-8efc-12313d28169d", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DebateCommunism", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679260358.0, "created_utc": 1679260358.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/11toej8/peter_singer_marx_was_a_philosopher_of_freedom_he/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2vkao", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Peter Singer: \"Marx - was a philosopher of freedom.

That revisionists (who themselves are capable of \"improving conditions\" - that's never been flatly denied though the reasoning this occurs is more complicated) have taken this argument of \"improving conditions is socialism\" to its endpoint, is actually just another manifestation of the labour aristocracy, only the ones who feel betrayed by the West and now see China as the true champion of the class. \n\n&gt;Socialism and socialist revolutionary movements began in Europe, the seat of capitalist imperialism and colonialism.\n\nThey ended here too.  All of the best socialists of Europe, the most educated Marxists, etc. formed the Second International -- a class body representative of the labour aristocracy -- which lead them into supporting the First World War at the behest of the bourgeoisie (even despite their own analysis in Basil a few years prior where they correctly concluded that they must oppose it should it occur), and this was because WW1 was a bloody imperialist war over who gets to control the colonies and oppress the world (Germany, Austria, etc were late to the colonization game and upon arriving discovered there was no more world left to colonize, and the basis of the war was that England and France wouldn't share).  These colonies provided the extracted superprofits to the imperial cores, elevating their proletariat to labour aristocracy, and reducing any revolutionary potential (it was noted in this era how homeowners do not join revolutions), but all of this comes at the cost of having to increase the exploitation and extraction of the colonies and the Global South.  The Second International was fine with this, and ended up supporting the war because they wanted those superprofits to benefit their domestic workers more.   Lenin was brilliant, but the reason he recognized this in the Second International is because Russia was 'the prison house of nations,' and that most of Russia was not the empire-insider labour aristocracy, but they were de facto the same as the exploited Global South, and that the Second International was a traitor to international workers by placing white European workers interests ahead of the Global masses, and from that Lenin became their true representative, and the Third International comprised of the proletariat class formed in hostility to the Second International and their labour aristocracy.  Europe never has a communist revolution after the failed attempt in shattered Germany in 1919, yet the Global South was about to have many -- communists are tasked with explaining and understanding this.  Europe spent decades on *Eurocommunism* which achieved nothing and collapsed utterly despite having almost no pressure against it while Asia, Latin America, and Africa were erupting with revolution.\n\n\n&gt;And yet when met with the fairly reasonable takes \"hey maybe a socialist revolution shouldn't be indiscriminately murderous\"\n\nThis isn't a reasonable take, this is fascist propaganda, but white socialism actualizes as fascism when it is forced to defend itself, so this isn't surprising either.  No socialist \"indiscriminately\" murders, though the murder of class enemies is a necessity and again Marx made this clear.  Was John Brown \"indiscriminately murdering\" the slavers?  Were the Haitian rebels under Dessalines \"indiscriminately murdering\" their oppressors?  Revolution is a bloody affair, and when you clutch your pearls as the thought of the masses liberating themselves from you, you are simply revealing your class interests.  The correct course of action for communists is to rip off your white skin and join John Brown and join the Haitian rebels in defiance.  \n\n&gt;\"can't socialists in the West work together with socialists in the third world?\"\n\nThey absolutely can (and historically have -- see *Settlers* for some great examples of how Black, Indigenous, and Asian labour formations have worked together and supported each other, only to be collectively smashed by privileged white labour protecting their class benefits) but the problem you aren't grasping is that white \"\"\"socialism\"\"\" is not socialist, none of these people are socialists (in fact they are some of socialism's most dangerous enemies), and that the actual socialists existing in the West will be both a much smaller and weaker formation, and also need to take much more drastic and radical action as a result of that, and both of these realizations make white \"\"\"socialists\"\"\" even more uncomfortable.

That revisionists (who themselves are capable of &amp;quot;improving conditions&amp;quot; - that&amp;#39;s never been flatly denied though the reasoning this occurs is more complicated) have taken this argument of &amp;quot;improving conditions is socialism&amp;quot; to its endpoint, is actually just another manifestation of the labour aristocracy, only the ones who feel betrayed by the West and now see China as the true champion of the class. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Socialism and socialist revolutionary movements began in Europe, the seat of capitalist imperialism and colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They ended here too.  All of the best socialists of Europe, the most educated Marxists, etc. formed the Second International -- a class body representative of the labour aristocracy -- which lead them into supporting the First World War at the behest of the bourgeoisie (even despite their own analysis in Basil a few years prior where they correctly concluded that they must oppose it should it occur), and this was because WW1 was a bloody imperialist war over who gets to control the colonies and oppress the world (Germany, Austria, etc were late to the colonization game and upon arriving discovered there was no more world left to colonize, and the basis of the war was that England and France wouldn&amp;#39;t share).  These colonies provided the extracted superprofits to the imperial cores, elevating their proletariat to labour aristocracy, and reducing any revolutionary potential (it was noted in this era how homeowners do not join revolutions), but all of this comes at the cost of having to increase the exploitation and extraction of the colonies and the Global South.  The Second International was fine with this, and ended up supporting the war because they wanted those superprofits to benefit their domestic workers more.   Lenin was brilliant, but the reason he recognized this in the Second International is because Russia was &amp;#39;the prison house of nations,&amp;#39; and that most of Russia was not the empire-insider labour aristocracy, but they were de facto the same as the exploited Global South, and that the Second International was a traitor to international workers by placing white European workers interests ahead of the Global masses, and from that Lenin became their true representative, and the Third International comprised of the proletariat class formed in hostility to the Second International and their labour aristocracy.  Europe never has a communist revolution after the failed attempt in shattered Germany in 1919, yet the Global South was about to have many -- communists are tasked with explaining and understanding this.  Europe spent decades on &lt;em&gt;Eurocommunism&lt;/em&gt; which achieved nothing and collapsed utterly despite having almost no pressure against it while Asia, Latin America, and Africa were erupting with revolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And yet when met with the fairly reasonable takes &amp;quot;hey maybe a socialist revolution shouldn&amp;#39;t be indiscriminately murderous&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t a reasonable take, this is fascist propaganda, but white socialism actualizes as fascism when it is forced to defend itself, so this isn&amp;#39;t surprising either.  No socialist &amp;quot;indiscriminately&amp;quot; murders, though the murder of class enemies is a necessity and again Marx made this clear.  Was John Brown &amp;quot;indiscriminately murdering&amp;quot; the slavers?  Were the Haitian rebels under Dessalines &amp;quot;indiscriminately murdering&amp;quot; their oppressors?  Revolution is a bloody affair, and when you clutch your pearls as the thought of the masses liberating themselves from you, you are simply revealing your class interests.  The correct course of action for communists is to rip off your white skin and join John Brown and join the Haitian rebels in defiance.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t socialists in the West work together with socialists in the third world?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They absolutely can (and historically have -- see &lt;em&gt;Settlers&lt;/em&gt; for some great examples of how Black, Indigenous, and Asian labour formations have worked together and supported each other, only to be collectively smashed by privileged white labour protecting their class benefits) but the problem you aren&amp;#39;t grasping is that white &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;socialism&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; is not socialist, none of these people are socialists (in fact they are some of socialism&amp;#39;s most dangerous enemies), and that the actual socialists existing in the West will be both a much smaller and weaker formation, and also need to take much more drastic and radical action as a result of that, and both of these realizations make white &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;socialists&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; even more uncomfortable.  This is the same problem in essence as &amp;quot;why can&amp;#39;t the Second International and Third International just get along?&amp;quot;  It&amp;#39;s because they are representing different classes and class interests -- whose interests are each on the opposite, hostile side of the imperialist divide (the principle contradiction in capitalism around which all others orient themselves) and history has already shown white Settler Colonial &amp;quot;labour&amp;quot; to be among the most singularly reactionary, fascistic, racist, and genocidal in all of world history.
