The item you have to make (wrists in all four cases) is the first recipe you learn once you learn the top-level material, so the alternative is getting your main and two alts to 110 and doing a few hours of questing on each to unlock them all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since prices on beta are so insane, what&amp;#39;s become more common are people in Trade offering to swap a cloth item for leather/mail/plate, so as long as you have one crafter at max and supplies to spare it won&amp;#39;t be a big deal. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/item=127002/imbued-silkweave-bracers\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/item=123917/demonsteel-armguards\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; ones both require &lt;a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/item=124115/stormscale\"&gt;Stormscale&lt;/a&gt;, so LW may be the best one to start with.
