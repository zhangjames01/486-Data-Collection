The staff psychiatrist in charge of Monkey\u2019s case thought there was a better-than-even chance that Monkey could make it on the street, and they both knew that the longer a man is in an institution the more he comes to need that closed environment, like a junkie with his smack.

Tough old world, baby. If you\u2019re not bolted together tightly, you\u2019re gonna shake, rattle, and roll before you turn thirty. Jack could sympathize with Grimmer\u2019s problem.
