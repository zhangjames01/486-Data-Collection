You will be able to see him fairly easily. Perhaps your parents would be okay with his coming to visit you all there, so they can be sure he is not going to kidnap you? That is how my mother felt about it. \n\nLeave yourself open to what they say, and be as calm about it as possible. Let them know that you know this man, and you are interested in him. Do you think he would be willing to let them talk to him? Offer them the chance. If they turn it down, that is their choice, but it shows that you are being open. \n\nIf you must, tell them that you do not want to choose between them and him, and they should not be forcing you to do that anyway. Chances are, things will turn out better than you expect. You just need to stay calm and let them know that you're really trying to do something on your own here.\n\nOr you could throw all that out the window and take it slowly.
