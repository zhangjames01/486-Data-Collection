The GBA has a d-pad, A, B, Start, Select, and L and R shoulder buttons. You've got the d-pad, A, B, and Start mapped. L and R's functions depend on the game's settings, and aren't required for anything. Select is used to change the order of things in menus, and can activate a registered item in-world, so it's a nice button to have.\n\nIn terms of other \"commands,\" we at TPP found it was nice to have single-character inputs for the d-pad since it gets used so often. We use N S E W (for the cardinal directions North, South, East and West) since they don't conflict with the L and R buttons. These work in addition to the classic Up Down Right and Left.\n\nI see you also have RunUp, RunDown, RunLeft, and RunRight. I'm assuming these press B in addition to the direction selected. That works, but another solution to consider is letting people press any (valid) combination of buttons. At TPP, we allow up to 3 buttons to be pressed at the same time, separated by +. So, you could type B+Up to run up, but you could also spam A+Right to buy Pokeballs 11 at a time in a shop, for example. By \"valid,\" I mean that you wouldn't allow people to \"break\" the d-pad. TPP doesn't let you input Left+Right or Up+Down. Also A+A wouldn't make sense because you can't press the same button twice at the same time.\n\nWe also have \"held\" inputs. They last about twice as long as a normal input and can be used to walk 2 tiles (or bike 3 tiles) with one input. On TPP, you make an input \"held\" by adding - to the end of it. The TPP input system builds in a \"sleep\" period at the end of each input to make sure repeated button presses don't merge into a single held button press. \"Held\" inputs will eliminate the sleep frames if inputs are fast enough so that they _can_ merge into a single press. This can come in handy when using the Mach bike for example.\n\nIf you want to go really crazy with the commands, TPP has a \"[Commander Mode](https://github.com/m4-used-rollout/commander-mode)\" script specifically designed for FireRed and Emerald (using the BizHawk emulator) that can translate battle commands into context-aware button presses. The idea is that in a Pokemon battle, you could say Move1 and Commander Mode would check the state of the battle menus and translate that Move1 into whichever button needs to be pressed to move the cursor into the Fight menu and select the first move. You'd probably have to adapt your input script to work with Commander Mode, but the code is there in the repo if you want to give it a try. You could also modify it so that instead of adapting a command to a single button press, it could continue pressing buttons until the command's goal is achieved. It would give a single user a lot of power over the game, but it would make battles far less tedious for a slow chat.\n\nThat's about as fancy as TPP has gotten with commands in standard GBA games.
