Still, I'd say my current state is determined by the previous states and the outside stimuli I was confronted with. So, nothing like the atom.\n\n&gt;And depending on your state, certain decisions are more likely. (Like if you're angry, you're more likely to strike someone)\n\nMarginally, but yes. Again, I don't think I am nondeterministic. Atomic decay is, virtual particles are, I am not.\n\n&gt; On that note, if these events really were random, would outside factors be able to influence their probability?\n\nYes. Just because there is a spontaneous trigger doesn't mean an event cannot be triggered by external influences.\n\n&gt;Well that depends - after decay, wouldn't it reach a more stable state? (Like going from C14 to C12).\n\nNot necessarily. This depends entirely on the atom. But at the end of each chain, there's a stable atom, of course.\n\n&gt;And if its very likely to have decayed into that more stable state after a billion years, then it would be less likely for it to decay when it was a billion years old than it had been when it was only a few minutes old.\n\nI'm not sure if I got you right.
