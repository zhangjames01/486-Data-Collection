I myself struggle with making myself do things that I'm not going to be able to care about, or if I feel like it's a pointless task. Yet most of these things are such that I also cannot escape the responsibility of doing them. E.G. turning in reports at work, or cooking dinner, bleh. I love clean clothes but absolutely hate laundry, is another example.  \n\nI am also a bit of a germophobe. I took a lot of science classes in school and I can almost see the bacteria and viruses living on my skin or on door handles etc. Obviously I can't actually see them, but one thing my mind is always able to remember is that they exist and are now multiplying on my hands from the door handle, etc. My brain is really good at remembering some stuff I wish it wouldn't, and it forgets other stuff it shouldn't. I wish it wouldn't forget why I walked into this room, or what I stood up to retrieve 6 seconds ago. My brain also knows that BO smell, isn't some scent my body releases, but dead bacteria rotting away on my hair in my arm pit. That's what causes BO. Bleh!\n\nShowers, therefore, have become a bit of a mental reset for me. Showers usually make me feel clean, and fresh, and the physical sensations of my body being wet and soapy etc, have become a signal to my brain that \"we're washing off the madness and starting over on something fresh\". It's honestly kinda like that sensation you have after you take some tight shoes off after a few hours, or scratch a hard to reach itch, etc. Like \"ahhhhhhhh, fuck all that shit (germs, frustration, failures, dirt, tiredness, etc) it's going down the drain\". I typically feel better both mentally and physically when drying off after a shower. I then usually have a small moment or two of clarity in which I can hear the quiet voice inside my head who had been drown out by all the other voices. They're yelling at me what I should feel guilty about and what I should be doing instead of procrastinating, what I was trying to do etc. When I actually hear that still inner voice I can actually make decisions. \n\nSo what I learned is that a shower can trigger a state of mindfulness or meditation for me. When I attain that state of quiet mindfulness, even if fleeting, I feel finally for a few minutes that I can be in control OF rather than being controlled BY my thoughts. \n\nSo I have been trying to extrapolate that information out to other areas. It's not that I have this \"executive dysfunction\" so much as the voice that decides things... or \"the executive decider\", if you will, who lives in my brain SPEAKS SUPER QUIETLY. He is actually there making calls all the time, I am just not hearing them, or paying attention. If I can turn down all the other noise I can hear him and we can have a conversation and get things done. \n\nI challenge you to look at your situation in these terms I have described. Perhaps you feel silly saying \"voices in my head\" but that is just manner of speaking. I don't actually hear but one voice in my head, as I am not insane. Think about it this way... Who, in their right mind, would rather do laundry than surf digital heroin on their phone? Who would rather mow the lawn, than sip a cold beverage in the shade? What insane person would rather do their taxes than sleep in a couple in more hours? No one, except the super freaks that do shit like tuck their undershirt into their underpants, etc. \n\nBut how about rearranging these ideas a little? It would be easy to look at my lawn mowing situation above. My natural ADHD mind might look at this situation at first sight and say... \"I have to mow the lawn and I can't sit in the shade and sip this cool drink, whoe is me\". Now mowing the lawn is a chore to be avoided. I will avoid doing it for as long as possible. If however instead I listen to the inner voice that knows better, he might try to suggest \"how about we mow this lawn, which will be hard work, but then after we are going to sit in the shade and have a cool drink and it will be extra refreshing\". Now, I am not forcing myself to mow the lawn the entire time I am doing it. I am not thinking \"when will this end, this is bullshit\", but \"man, how much ice will fit in the glass I wonder, do I want caffeine in this drink?\". I'm getting the lawn mowed either way, but one method is sheer drudgery, and the other is like playing a game. \n\nI think if you can start to tune out some of the other voices, opinions, input, distractions, etc, you may be able to also hear and listen to that inner voice that's probably asking you politely and quietly to do things you need to do in life.

Come to find out, that living with undiagnosed and untreated ADHD, can lead to greater chances of anxiety and depression because we just can&amp;#39;t seem sometimes to force ourselves to do the things we need to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;#39;m finalizing a move out of a house I lived in for over 15 years. I am seeing every day the evidence that I had ADHD this entire time. I am not a hoarder, but I would get excited about a project. Collect all the knowledge and, materials I needed for this new hobby. Do it once or twice, and then put it on a shelf and I will &amp;quot;finish this later&amp;quot;. Then promptly get distracted by a new project. Rinse and repeat this for 15 years. Stuff this on the back of this shelf, etc. It&amp;#39;s deeply sickening how I, nor anyone around me, didn&amp;#39;t realize this decades ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway.... I wanted to share that you aren&amp;#39;t alone in this anger, and I feel for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_tvu3ey", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/tvu3ey/adhd_post_diagnosis_anger/i3enhju/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tvu3ey/adhd_post_diagnosis_anger/", "name": "t1_i3enhju", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1649107954.0, "created_utc": 1649107954.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tvu3ey/adhd_post_diagnosis_anger/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How do I explain to people that a thing I sometimes do is because of my ADHD, without making it sound like an excuse?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ADHD", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i3ektxu", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "SirBrutis", "num_comments": 50, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_tvxn0m", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_58y93", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think it's hard for people to rewrite the narrative in their head about something, especially when it implies they have had it wrong.

I care that she wants me to come back and see me again. Does this make me a &amp;quot;good guy&amp;quot; or just someone who isn&amp;#39;t a selfish asshole? That level of respect is what anyone wants and deserves. I&amp;#39;m not going to change who I am to be with someone, but I think I can at least deliver a baseline if respect to anyone I encounter in life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you just found some overly critical boy who still lives with his parents, and obviously hasn&amp;#39;t figured shit out yet. My advice is I think the sooner you can stop seeing things as &amp;quot;good guy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bad boy&amp;quot; as polar opposites like a light switch and realize that everyone alive is instead a different shade of grey, the better off you will be. Judge people for who they are, rather than what stereotype they fit into.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_q65oqx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/sex/comments/q65oqx/deleted_by_user/hg9yweu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/q65oqx/deleted_by_user/", "name": "t1_hg9yweu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/sex", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1633987274.0, "created_utc": 1633987274.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/q65oqx/deleted_by_user/"}}], "before": null}}
