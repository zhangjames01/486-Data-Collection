People in poorer neighborhoods usually commit more crime because there are less legal ways to make money. They&amp;#39;re not committing crimes for shits and giggles. The nunbers would probably spike in any race if you viewed how much crime was committed by those who lived in poorer neighborhoods. I don&amp;#39;t have the stats for it currently but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure black people in middle or upper class settings aren&amp;#39;t committing nearly as many crimes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this notion that black people are inherently more violent is still, in fact, just an excuse to justify ones prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cannot justify killing an innocent person. I don&amp;#39;t give a shit if every black person you&amp;#39;ve ever met beat the shit out of you. People cannot be regularly and consistently predicted because of the color of fheir skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3hpq4t", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/news/comments/3hpq4t/9yearold_shot_dead_in_ferguson_while_sitting_in/cuaequu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3hpq4t/9yearold_shot_dead_in_ferguson_while_sitting_in/", "name": "t1_cuaequu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1440139211.0, "created_utc": 1440139211.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.people.com/article/9-year-old-jamyla-bolden-shot-to-death-ferguson"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "9-Year-Old Shot Dead in Ferguson While Sitting in Bed Doing Her Homework", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "news", "link_author": "Stthads", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cua1db7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "LeftFootRightHand", "num_comments": 8345, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cua0sul", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_byscj", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not really. \n\n  Whites are disproportionately raping more often than blacks.
