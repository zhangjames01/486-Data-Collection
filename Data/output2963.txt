Compound movements with free weights MIGHT allow you to challenge more muscles/muscle groups within a given time period as well, but that depends on too many variables to discuss at length.\n\nOf course, this is all contingent on your ability to execute any of the movements in question with absolute control and without compromised body mechanics.\n\n\nTL:DR -- it ultimately depends on your goals and current capabilities.
