Importantly, it's a pretty modern HD game and has a semi-open world of interconnected zones, with a story that feels comparable to mainline DQ.  I don't really like button mashing games, but I enjoyed DQH2 enough to complete it.  As you've finished all the DQ (except 10) games, you'll also probably enjoy seeing the DQ characters in HD.  DQH1 is not necessary (at all) as the stories / worlds are completely different \\[even canonically, characters that met in DQH1 meet again in DQH2 but both times they act as if it was the first time they met each other\\].\n2. DQ Builders 2 -- It's a little more than minecraft, there's a fair amount of town management / city building aspect to it, and the quests + story do make it feel distinct from minecraft.  But there's a free demo available, and it lets you continue your progress if your purchase the game, so I'd recommend trying that before buying.  DQ Builders 1 is also a great title, but has less town management stuff, less quality of life improvements, etc.  Again, the stories don't really overlap so you can play DQB2 without 1.\n3. DQ Rocket Slime for Nintendo DS -- only caveat being that I bet it's hard to track down a copy, though I haven't looked recently.  (Reminder: the 3DS can also play DS games.)\n\nDQ Monsters is a strong spinoff series, and DQ Monsters 1 and 2 in particular made huge improvements at the time, especially the breeding of monsters which was not available in Pokemon at the time. I guess you could try digging out a copy for the GBC, but it also uses the old localization ('ye olde english') of Dragon Warrior days (1-4 for NES, 1-3 for GBC, and 7 for PS1).\n\nStill, much of the series is not available legally in English, and the most recent ones that are were tied to the Nintendo DS, so it's pretty dated visually.  (It was impressively trying to aim for full 3D quasi-open world on the DS, and more or less hit its target.  But it's still the DS so it was limited.)   \n\nThe most recent sub-series entry, DQ Treasures was localized and is a sort of DQ Monsters game, but honestly I haven't tried it yet.  The reviews were positive-ish, but I'd probably recommend trying the free demo (again, you can continue your demo save file on the main game).\n\nOther localized spinoffs include:\n\n* DQ Swords -- I mean, it's fine.  There's the bones of a good game there, but probably hampered by the original Wii Remote's sensors.  They later made a VR game available in Japan that I think uses some of the same concepts, if you ever make your way to Shinjuku.\n* DQ Builders 1 and Heroes 1 -- but I'd just play Builders 2 and Heroes 2 unless you know you want to complete all games and worry about the \"reduction\" in quality of life by playing 2 first and then 1.\n* Torneko : The Last Hope for PS1 -- I haven't honesty played this, but the Torneko games were the original \"Mystery Dungeon\" games, which are basically Japan's take on Rogue (the series / developer has now spawned stuff like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Shinen the wanderer).  Still, given it's on the PS1 and uses the old localization, I think you'd generally be better off playing a newer Mystery Dungeon game unless you really love Torneko and will do anything to get more Torneko.\n* Dragon Quest Wars for DSiware (hence also available on 3DS I believe, at least till the eshop shuts down).  Basically a forebearer of Dragon Quest Tact (the smartphone game), it's short and probably not necessary to play.  Though, if you are a completionist, it will soon no longer be able to purchase legally.\n* Fortune Street : Sort of like Monopoly, there's no canonical story here though.  Just cameos by DQ characters / monsters.\n* Theatrhythm Dragon Quest:  Technically not localized, but it's a rhythm game where only the menus and tutorials are japanese, pretty easy to get into if you wanted.  But note that the 3DS is region locked by default, requiring either unlocking yours or buying a Japanese region 3DS to play.

As it's a tactics game, slow animations can kill the game IMO.\n\nAlso just my subjective opinion, but I had to watch the trailer about 3 times before I understood that the treasure chest was unlocking the skill \"Push\" which is then shown in the next battle scene.  I think the initial battle scene does a decent job of showing the turn-based combat, but is probably a little \"boring\".  Consider switching out the first combat scene for a flashier attack, then going right to the upgrade stuff that currently appears at 0:30.\n\nI had my sound muted and your trailer might benefit from some subtitle / transition cards.\n\nRight now, the characters have a nice art style, but nothing in the trailer (when muted) tells me about their \"characterization\".  It's not necessary, but although I'm visually attracted to the characters, I don't know who they are / what they stand for / why they are together.\n\nMy last impression, from the title card, is that the game is kind of \"light and fluffy\", not to take things too seriously.  The enemies and PC are standing all together.  This is reinforced with the title having \"Whimsical\".\n\nSo overall, as a viewer, information I received from the trailer:\n\n* Story here will be minimal and light.  (And since it doesn't seem like a pure parody, that might be best given the direction the game is heading.)\n* Combat will be the majority of the game\n* Character upgrades exist, some received as rewards, other cost resources\n* Some Base-building aspects\n* (Based on Steam Description) a heavy focus on strategy / synergies\n\nBroadly speaking, this game direction seems somewhat similar to the Mario vs Rabbids Games.\n\nSpeaking personally, although I love turn-based Tactics RPGS (FFT, Tactics Ogre, Fire Emblem, Into The Breach) this game doesn't hit my interest areas at the moment.  First, there was no hook, such as something unique that only this game provides.  Secondly, I'm primarily interested in story-based games, but if I want to play a pure strategy game such as Into the Breach, then I need the strategy to be extremely engaging.  This is not currently being communicated clearly enough in the trailer IMO.  Some things are mildly interesting, such as the existence of positioning + traps, but nothing particularly noteworthy.\n\nIf I were trying to pivot from the current gameplay on display, I'd expand on the \"base-building\" stuff, maybe including farming as a core part of the narrative (as many characters are already food variants).  Perhaps farming resources can be used in-battle as well, or the battles can directly influence the farming -- for example, if I am fighting on my farm, enemies that bump into my corn may damage it.

Perhaps I can also summon crops from the field to fight alongside me, but lose those warriors as resources later (and they only last one battle).  In general, I think because the field of combat is quite \"static\" (same grid every time, with seemingly no territorial bonuses, and only traps / rocks) then letting the player directly influence the field of combat (e.g. through farming) would be critical.  The goal would be to achieve something like Harvest Moon TRPG, though it may be too difficult with current art resources.\n\nI'm no expert, but it seems like the focus on strategy as the selling-point may be running against the art direction / narrative / title, all of which seem more casual-focused.\n\nHowever, I'm a so-called \"core user\" for the genre, and my favorite titles like Tactics Ogre don't sell all that well.

As it&amp;#39;s a tactics game, slow animations can kill the game IMO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also just my subjective opinion, but I had to watch the trailer about 3 times before I understood that the treasure chest was unlocking the skill &amp;quot;Push&amp;quot; which is then shown in the next battle scene.  I think the initial battle scene does a decent job of showing the turn-based combat, but is probably a little &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot;.  Consider switching out the first combat scene for a flashier attack, then going right to the upgrade stuff that currently appears at 0:30.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had my sound muted and your trailer might benefit from some subtitle / transition cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, the characters have a nice art style, but nothing in the trailer (when muted) tells me about their &amp;quot;characterization&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s not necessary, but although I&amp;#39;m visually attracted to the characters, I don&amp;#39;t know who they are / what they stand for / why they are together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My last impression, from the title card, is that the game is kind of &amp;quot;light and fluffy&amp;quot;, not to take things too seriously.  The enemies and PC are standing all together.  This is reinforced with the title having &amp;quot;Whimsical&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So overall, as a viewer, information I received from the trailer:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Story here will be minimal and light.  (And since it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like a pure parody, that might be best given the direction the game is heading.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Combat will be the majority of the game&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Character upgrades exist, some received as rewards, other cost resources&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some Base-building aspects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(Based on Steam Description) a heavy focus on strategy / synergies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, this game direction seems somewhat similar to the Mario vs Rabbids Games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking personally, although I love turn-based Tactics RPGS (FFT, Tactics Ogre, Fire Emblem, Into The Breach) this game doesn&amp;#39;t hit my interest areas at the moment.  First, there was no hook, such as something unique that only this game provides.  Secondly, I&amp;#39;m primarily interested in story-based games, but if I want to play a pure strategy game such as Into the Breach, then I need the strategy to be extremely engaging.  This is not currently being communicated clearly enough in the trailer IMO.  Some things are mildly interesting, such as the existence of positioning + traps, but nothing particularly noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I were trying to pivot from the current gameplay on display, I&amp;#39;d expand on the &amp;quot;base-building&amp;quot; stuff, maybe including farming as a core part of the narrative (as many characters are already food variants).

The most obvious was Elite Beat Agents, the western version of Ouendan for DS.  But it was a commercial flop (Reggie laments it, there's an interview of him saying like \"why didn't you guys buy it \\*sad face\\*\") \n\nThe less obvious example is, I personally believe, Dragon Quest.  Reggie was a huge Dragon Quest fan.  DQ 8 on PS2 did pretty okay, but DQ 4 on DS bombed, and Nintendo of America stepped in a big way to support DQ 5 and especially DQ 6 (even publishing it and basically localizing it in house).  Despite 6 being a commercial failure, they got 9 to come over as well.\n\nDQ 7 3DS for west was one of the strangest announcements in my history of following gaming news.  Reggie just finished giving a HUGE presentation on what's coming to the 3DS, tons of titles, including a slide with a bunch of titles.  He sits down and someone from Kotaku (IIRC) asks him \"hey what about DQ 7\" (which had been officially announced in Japan) and apparently Reggie gave some sort of thumbs up or agreement (enough to run the story at least), but it was not mentioned again for a LONG time and then was delayed again and again, and almost released around the time of DQ 8 3DS right as Switch was releasing.

Reggie was a huge Dragon Quest fan.  DQ 8 on PS2 did pretty okay, but DQ 4 on DS bombed, and Nintendo of America stepped in a big way to support DQ 5 and especially DQ 6 (even publishing it and basically localizing it in house).  Despite 6 being a commercial failure, they got 9 to come over as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DQ 7 3DS for west was one of the strangest announcements in my history of following gaming news.
