If I can perceive I'm going against baby survivor(s), I'll lay off on 'em a bit.  I feel bad slaughtering puppies, even if they're trying.  All bets are off if somebody hides, goes AFK, and collects crows.  They're hurting their team and threw the match by giving me an advantage.\n\nHeck, once I turned a 4-squad Blendette match into fun.  They all had flashlights in the lobby.  I could've dodged outright, but brought party streamers.  In the trial, they had CoH and Exponential, plus sabo builds.  At first, it was **miserable** because getting hooks was near impossible.  Or I'd have to extinguish totems and hope they didn't recover constantly.  And avoid blinds.\n\nI ended up changing my mindset and would farm them instead.  Count my hooks, make sure to slug, know they would recover anyway, and purposely get blinded.  Eventually, it became \"not fun\" for them, so they finished gens and left.  I didn't care for sacrifices (just 2x hooks) and end-game-chat, they asked why I was farming.  Simple:  They didn't \\*expect\\* me to change motive, so I had no rationale to become 'sweaty'.  So lobbies are really a non-issue.\n\nAnyway, about chases.  Sometimes you might want to bait pallet drops in strong loops (e.g. Shack) to get it out of the way early.  But if you're spending ~2 minutes chasing somebody around shack, that's time being wasted.  Kind of like how survivors will run inside buildings on Haddonfield.  If there's no gen in that house (or it already popped), I (usually) have zero reason to follow.  \n\nHonestly it's situational.  You can (eventually) gain a sense of when you're being out-played.  But with some killers, it's worth it.  Like if I'm playing Clown, I **will** follow you to shack, because I know how to play those tiles.  While I'm chasing a survivor, I'll launch a bottle *through* the window and make it land at the upcoming door.  Either they have to hit the smoke (and risk getting an M1 hit) or abandon shack.  And if they're hugging the wall with the camera reversed at me, they're not going to see the smoke cloud ahead of them.  \n\nOtherwise, I'll break chase after I injured them.  Some players won't do objectives injured.  Or they may waste time with self-care, be forever-booners, or walk the perimeter of the wall.  Regardless of the situation, they are **not** doing gens.  Instead of you wasting time on an endless pursuit, they're wasting the team's time.  (In solo queue, I'm watching auras with Kindred/Empathy and see this every now and then.)\n\nThe 'correct' strategy is always going to be a gamble.  If you're near-100% certainty you can down them, then take the bet, especially if you can get at least one hit.  Other times?

Gens take 90 seconds for an individual.  If you're spending 90 seconds in one chase, you can lose 3 gens.

Sometimes I'll lose my interest killing people after two sacrifices.  Then I may just throw the match and let the others escape.  I don't aim to please the Entity, since sometimes the survivors can be more amusing.  \"Fun\" doesn't strictly mean 'winning'.  Some of the fun may also be knowing your opponent(s) are having fun.  That's why sometimes I like scaring survivors or playing with some killers.  It might break the fourth wall and I'll know the *person* holding the controller/mouse is just as amused/engaged.  Those moments make it worth re-lobbying.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "K15D", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "WHO STOLE MY SHOES?!?"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sometimes I&amp;#39;ll change my game style on the flip of a dime.  If I can perceive I&amp;#39;m going against baby survivor(s), I&amp;#39;ll lay off on &amp;#39;em a bit.  I feel bad slaughtering puppies, even if they&amp;#39;re trying.  All bets are off if somebody hides, goes AFK, and collects crows.  They&amp;#39;re hurting their team and threw the match by giving me an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heck, once I turned a 4-squad Blendette match into fun.  They all had flashlights in the lobby.  I could&amp;#39;ve dodged outright, but brought party streamers.  In the trial, they had CoH and Exponential, plus sabo builds.  At first, it was &lt;strong&gt;miserable&lt;/strong&gt; because getting hooks was near impossible.  Or I&amp;#39;d have to extinguish totems and hope they didn&amp;#39;t recover constantly.  And avoid blinds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up changing my mindset and would farm them instead.  Count my hooks, make sure to slug, know they would recover anyway, and purposely get blinded.  Eventually, it became &amp;quot;not fun&amp;quot; for them, so they finished gens and left.  I didn&amp;#39;t care for sacrifices (just 2x hooks) and end-game-chat, they asked why I was farming.  Simple:  They didn&amp;#39;t *expect* me to change motive, so I had no rationale to become &amp;#39;sweaty&amp;#39;.  So lobbies are really a non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, about chases.  Sometimes you might want to bait pallet drops in strong loops (e.g. Shack) to get it out of the way early.  But if you&amp;#39;re spending ~2 minutes chasing somebody around shack, that&amp;#39;s time being wasted.  Kind of like how survivors will run inside buildings on Haddonfield.  If there&amp;#39;s no gen in that house (or it already popped), I (usually) have zero reason to follow.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly it&amp;#39;s situational.  You can (eventually) gain a sense of when you&amp;#39;re being out-played.  But with some killers, it&amp;#39;s worth it.  Like if I&amp;#39;m playing Clown, I &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; follow you to shack, because I know how to play those tiles.  While I&amp;#39;m chasing a survivor, I&amp;#39;ll launch a bottle &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the window and make it land at the upcoming door.  Either they have to hit the smoke (and risk getting an M1 hit) or abandon shack.  And if they&amp;#39;re hugging the wall with the camera reversed at me, they&amp;#39;re not going to see the smoke cloud ahead of them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I&amp;#39;ll break chase after I injured them.  Some players won&amp;#39;t do objectives injured.  Or they may waste time with self-care, be forever-booners, or walk the perimeter of the wall.  Regardless of the situation, they are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; doing gens.  Instead of you wasting time on an endless pursuit, they&amp;#39;re wasting the team&amp;#39;s time.  (In solo queue, I&amp;#39;m watching auras with Kindred/Empathy and see this every now and then.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;correct&amp;#39; strategy is always going to be a gamble.

Activate easy killer challenges, such as \"Chase survivors for 360 seconds\", \"Damage 25 generators\", \"Hit survivors with your weapon 15 times\", etc.  Even with a loss, you should have progress (or completion) of those easy challenges.  Your brain will take that as a reward or consolation prize.  While not an outright win, that sense of accomplishment may invigorate you to persevere.\n\nBaby steps.  Later, you can graduate to other challenges.  \"Hook 8 survivors\", \"Sacrifice 257 survivors\", etc.  Save the ~~sweaty~~ *complex* or killer-specific challenges for later.  \"Hook 4 survivors in 60 seconds after grabbing them from a generator while Undetectable during a lunar eclipse.  Do this in one trial.\"  Some of those may drive one insane until they learn the ropes.\n\nAnyway, another piece of advice is achieving an early sense of the lobby.  Sometimes, off the bat, you can ascertain the composition of a lobby.  They may all be solo.  It may be a SWF.  It may be a mix.  While not necessary, you can get a basic understanding of potential playstyles.  Same/similar names, identical cosmetics, same items, etc.  Although it **can** be misleading (they're randomly doing challenges), it may help with expectations.  Toolboxes?

That might be a strategy at the expense of 1 or 2 perk slots.  Or that may be for laughs.  You can decide.  Nonetheless, do not be intimidated.  When picking up people, learn how to position yourself toward walls, lockers, etc.  Secondarily, check your surroundings if you get the tiniest inkling somebody may be behind a corner.  Also, know when to look up to avoid a potential blind.  Flashlights may be fun or annoying, and you may possibly mitigate their use.  Heck, sometimes it's a-okay to intentionally take the blind (e.g. while breaking a pallet).\n\nSpeaking of pallets, respecting them may vary.  As you're well aware, every player is different.  Some people play like bots and will pre-drop or panic.  Meanwhile, others (like myself), are terrible at looping.  Therefore, I won't drop pallets unless I'm 99.9% sure I can stun a killer.  Instead, as survivor, I'll save the pallets for others who can use them strategically.  As killer, what you may need to do is extract a sense of how well that survivor plays.

On some maps, you might have lopsided placement.  For example, one gen may appear in a far corner.  Feel free to let that one pop and avoid having to travel 1,000 miles to check on it.  Some players think \"no terror radius = do this gen\" and can become dunderheads who foolishly created a 3-gen.  Or they'll hop on the first gen they spawn at.  That's not always in their best interest.  Know which gen(s) are valuable and casually keep an eye while patrolling.  \n\nThat also folds into what I mentioned about knowing *when* to break chase.
