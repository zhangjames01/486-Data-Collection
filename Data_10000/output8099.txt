Not because there&amp;#39;s something you need to &amp;#39;fix&amp;#39; but because they can help you both build tools for these conflicts and help guide y&amp;#39;all towards, hopefully, building a better dynamic in the family or setting appropriate boundaries if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_au91jw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/au91jw/i_28f_have_accidentally_caused_drama_with_my/eh7wohx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/au91jw/i_28f_have_accidentally_caused_drama_with_my/", "name": "t1_eh7wohx", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1551062855.0, "created_utc": 1551062855.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/au91jw/i_28f_have_accidentally_caused_drama_with_my/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "My wife (31F) found my (37M) therapy notebook", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "relationships", "link_author": "everythingsperfect", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ea5wqoj", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ananci", "num_comments": 98, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_9yxtff", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_467ql", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "When I was a kid I wrote a nasty story about my step siblings.

Not because you can't do it, because you *are* doing it, but because it means those folks rarely get the leadership mentorship that's so vital to be an effective manager.

Not in a way that suggests they are uniquely qualified to manage others. Let's be clear, she was hired to be your secretary and when she failed at that he did some weird protiom demotion thing where she is training other trainers or something. Why is the founder so eager to have teenagers working for him I wonder? Why does this random 18 year old have a busy startup founder's ear? From the outside this is creepy.\n\nIgnoring that creepiness - you need to toughen up butter cup.

You seen to be afraid to find out who your boss will support. Clarify your role around employee expectations. Your employee told you she was harrassing him.

Not because you can&amp;#39;t do it, because you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; doing it, but because it means those folks rarely get the leadership mentorship that&amp;#39;s so vital to be an effective manager. All this means is that your going to have to learn these lessons on your own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An 18 year old does not have meaningful teaching experience. Not in a way that suggests they are uniquely qualified to manage others. Let&amp;#39;s be clear, she was hired to be your secretary and when she failed at that he did some weird protiom demotion thing where she is training other trainers or something.
