Long term stability- I was lucky enough to find a medication combination that worked fairly early (lamictal and ad hoc seroquel). I've held down a good job for three years, got married and kept a cat alive. I'm not perfect, and I will be on medication for the rest of my life. But I know I can be in a comparable position to a lot of other people having kids.\n\n2. Staying on lamictal is the best option for me, giving me the best chance at a healthy pregnancy - When my husband and I went to talk to my psych about having kids he gave a good rundown of a lot of the risks to getting off lamictal. From not taking care of myself and the baby, to increased risk of suicide and psychosis. Versus the fairly minor potential complications to the baby. And the increased risks for the most part are not much more than the general population. Eg (don't have it in front of me) chance of particular defects  in general population is 2%, for lamictal users 2.5%. While I get occasional pangs of guilt, I've made it through a fairly rough first trimester without major emotional problems and baby is so far developing normally. I've stopped taking seroquel however, but I've been told if things get dire later ad hoc use is an option.\n\n3. Even if his/her mother is sometimes sick, my baby will have an excellent father- even though I've been lucky so far, it would be stupid for me to think I'll definitely never relapse or have medication issues. It's a serious illness. But a good friend pointed out that lots of people have parents who go through tough times, and one thing I have that a lot of others don't is a wonderful man who will be a great father. He was with me through several years pre and post diagnosis. He already loves the baby. I feel better in taking this on knowing that my baby has one consistently great parent on lock- but feel optimistic I will be up there too most of the time.\n\nIt's really hard- and I have a long way to go.

I liked my friend's super mums, and could see the benefits, but it just isn't who she is. Instead, she was a role model for me- teaching me to identify the things you want to do, work hard for your goals, look after yourself and those you love, be the best person you can be so you come home fulfilled, but still keep your priorities in check. I never minded that she wasn't a cookie cutter mum, because the second I called or needed anything she was there. To help me learn, to talk about what I was doing, to share with me things that she loved and reminded me all the time that we were what mattered most.\n\nSo she was very far from the 'perfect mum' by a lot of those conventional standards, but she was the perfect mum for us. She used to stress out about it all the time- and still sometimes asks whether we really didn't resent her for it. She still tells the story of when I was about six and came home and asked her why she didn't bake cakes like the other mothers. She said she cried, and baked a cake that weekend :P The funny thing is that I don't remember that at all! I am sure that that did cross my mind as a kid, but it has done no lasting damage!In fact, it has inspired me to want to parent as much like her as possible.\n\nMy mum doesn't have bipolar. I do. But we are very alike in temperament, and a lot of the time she took out from our growing up to work on her own goals, I will need to take away from my kids to work on my own health, same as you. My only hope for my future kids, is that if I am to them (or to other parents) a slightly unconventional parent, who is rude enough to have to make my fulfilment and health a priority, that they understand later why I needed to do that, the same way as I understand now why my mum wasn't a PTA mum. I just hope to god that my children know how much I love them, and how important they are to me every day, the same way my mum instilled that in me, so that they will forgive me for the ways I am not like the 'other mums.'\n\nSo forget their standards. Don't try and measure yourself. If you do right by your kid 90% of the time- and sometimes that is knowing when to seek help, or outsourcing the things that you can't do at that time- then that is enough. No one is perfect. Just focus on making sure he knows how much you love him, how special he is, and that all the things you are doing are to make life better for you both. And I am sure you do. Even if he doesn't get it all now that is what he will remember- the love and the time you did take. That is what I remember, and that is why my mum is still one of my favourite people, and a great parent.\n\nSo while I can't advise you on parenting with bipolar, I hope you will at least take away that being a slightly less hands-on 'perfect' looking mother is not a bad thing at all, as long as your kid knows why and that you love him. I know that it is harder- I am terrified of parenting with bipolar in a few years- but thinking about my mum makes me a bit less scared. \n\nSorry for the long post, but my heart breaks for you. You are working hard- you need to be a good and well person to be a good mum, so don't worry about taking that time to do that because he will get it one day. Good luck!\n\nTL;DR 'Perfect' mothers are overrated! Just make sure your child knows that the time you take to take care of yourself is for him too, because that teaches him that he too will need to balance his own needs with that of others in the long run which is okay.
