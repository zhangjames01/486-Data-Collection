Usually with pain medication, you want to be more precise if u have to do high dosages. To achieve that precision, you need to do it via injection. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taken orally, there is a possibility for fluctuations in dosage due to some of the drug degradation in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the idea is that most likely gp2 did not need the same concentration that would need to be achieved from an injection.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is still not standard medication and is not over the counter. So its still bad, just not as bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_110pikx", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/nba/comments/110pikx/payton_according_to_sources_had_been_playing/j8b0gvp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/110pikx/payton_according_to_sources_had_been_playing/", "name": "t1_j8b0gvp", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/nba", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1676246427.0, "created_utc": 1676246427.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/110pikx/payton_according_to_sources_had_been_playing/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rtiv", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[The Athletic] Sources have clarified that GP2 was given the Toradol orally, not via injection, as initially reported.
