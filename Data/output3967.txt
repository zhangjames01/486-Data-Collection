Story time. I'm on my phone, so bare with me.\n\nI met her in the fall of 2002, we were both freshmen in marching band at our university. I was on the drumline and she was the hottest flag girl. Let's call her \"Stephanie\". Well, her name actually *is* Stephanie but I can trust you guys, right?\n\n\nAnyways. We were the couple that you all know. If you want to hang out with one of them they both are coming. We were always together. My fraternity brothers even gave her the same nickname I had, because we were inseparable, and we're pretty much the same person. We were together from nov '02 til may '05. We broke up mutually- I had made it clear to her I wasn't going anywhere in life at the time and she had grown so distant I barely knew her anymore and our lifestyles just didn't match anymore. She had new and different friends, so did I. But we continued to talk after we broke up....and continued to have sex.\n\n\nShe would show up at my apartment horny and ready to fuck, saying she can't stay long because her friends/family is waiting on her, has to be at work, etc.  I was starting to fall in love with her again. Well, at the end of July,  I found out that she had moved in with one of her new friends right after we broke up, her new friend that she was introducing to other people as her 'fiance'. I had met this guy before. He was a total fuckwit. It was agreed upon in the brief eye contact we made when I met him months before that I didn't like him, he didn't like me.  \n\n\nWhen I found out she was engaged and suppose to be married in September, I confronted her, she apologized for lying to me, and she got with him because she wanted 'stability' (he's in the army.... To this day i dont know If they were seeing eachother when we were together) but she also said that he has no idea what he's doing in the sack and she never enjoyed sex with him so when she craved more almost daily, she would show up at my house for a ride or two and go about he business, telling no one where she was.\n\n\nSo I said to her she needs to leave this guy if it's that bad, and she's cheating and blah blah blah, she wasn't having any of that. I asked what would her new friends think of what she's doing and she said they don't and will not know. She told me no one would believe me and to just stay quiet about it because our little thing won't last forever. \n\n\nWell, I still had the phone numbers of her old friends she use to hang with when we were a couple and started digging for more details.(this was 2005, text messages were expensive) One by one I talked to them and they were lip-sealed. Wouldn't tell me shit, they didn't believe a word I said about me and Stephanie still having sex either, sayin I'm 'just jealous'. Finally I was frustrated and said somethig along the lines of \"well I'm going to show up at the wedding, see what people think/say about what's going on\". Her reply was a vague form of \"we'll call the cops/forcibly remove you if you show up\". When the words left my mouth I wasn't sure if I really meant it, but if these people are so hell bent on ensuring she actually marries this guy, it was my only choice. So I started talking to a buddy of mine we'll call him 'Frank', he dated Stephanie's best friend (Megan) for quite a while the previous year and still talked to her. I laid out my plan to him and he said he'd be down to just do it himself so I didn't take a chance of being spotted...if I paid him (we we're drunk). So I offered him some cash to do it. \n\n\n The next day, I get a call from Stephanie's best friend pretty much saying it's a new low for me to try to pay a gullible person to do something that fucked up an he was really going to go as her date and do it, now they're going to move the date and venue, etc etc.... I was pretty pissed that frank told Megan everything. But my plan was foiled and every body who had knowledge of the wedding wasn't gonna tell anyone who asks about it. So I gave up. Realized she's 'happy' with this guy and just because I knew how to make her orgasm 2 or 3 times every time we fucked was NOT enough of a reason for her to take me back. She has a decent life now and I have an awesome life now. Things coulda been different, but doubt it would've turned out as well for either of us If I had gone through with it.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** broke up w/gf of 2+ years, continued to sex eachother while she had new bf/fianc\u00e9. I wanted her back but she just wanted sex, I was immature  and overreacting, threatened to ruin wedding. Then realized it wasn't worth it. I learned a good life lesson and moved on. \n\nEdit: spaces", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay.
