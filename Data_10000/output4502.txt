absolutely\".\n\nThird and lastly, your plug on how so many people don't understand how we could possibly end up with *that* winner. Leads straight into discussing the \"Political Skill\" traits found in ALL POSITIONS OF POWER **WINNERS**. They vary in number from study to study, but all winning candidates have a larger cumulative balance between:\n\n1. **Influence**: Favors&gt;money. Having a billion dollars of your own cash to put toward an election is idiotic and not nearly as powerful as having 1000 people investing a million dollars each of their own. You don't lose all your cash if you lose and you now have 1000 cutthroats making sure you win so they can collect their returns with interest in the form of shady policy (think original documents of the TPP that required votes to be cast on withheld sections that could contain anything).\n\n2. **Charisma**: The ability to convince people that they should listen to what you have to say before they go looking at what the others have to offer. Charisma isn't just the flare that catches peoples eyes though. It is contagious and addictive. Charisma makes people *want* to follow you instead of just being told to. Charisma creating the gateway to building support is historically seen to decline or grow due to many factors. An example may be presented as an aged man  naturally viewed as weaker and possibly not up to the stress of leadership in the last several years of unknown health, but this effect may be reversed to inspire by showing knowledge gained from years of passionate service in this field compared to other competition.\n\n3. **Social Coercion**: The ability to know what to say and how to say it to each group of people to elicit an emotional response of agreement, support, and finally action. The work of election support teams at each event extracts polling data from those attending so speech writers can tailor the verbiage just enough to keep smiles and cheers from the crowd while hopefully not contradicting previous statements. Simplified, the format usually goes in order of   **Anger+Hope+Fear=Loyalty**. *Anger* is the easiest and most effective rallying varied groups into one unified mass working for one common goal. *Hope* then comes advertised as being able to rely on the leaders genuine concern for every groups growing concerns with unflinching resolve. *Fear* finally keeps people loyal. Just saying you could do a better job suggests your opponent might do something positive at all. Ensuring fear that electing someone else is a dire threat to your supporters most fundamental beliefs, way's of life, and even safety keeps the uneducated and blindly bias loyal, dramatically aggressive to any opposition, and loudly promoting your brand.\n\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, AWESOME VIDEO &lt;sup&gt;and&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;#39;m sorry that the following is so lengthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, the more accurate version of the famous phrase &amp;quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely&amp;quot; should be &amp;quot;The quest to obtain and keep absolute power corrupts absolutely&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third and lastly, your plug on how so many people don&amp;#39;t understand how we could possibly end up with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; winner. Leads straight into discussing the &amp;quot;Political Skill&amp;quot; traits found in ALL POSITIONS OF POWER &lt;strong&gt;WINNERS&lt;/strong&gt;. They vary in number from study to study, but all winning candidates have a larger cumulative balance between:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence&lt;/strong&gt;: Favors&amp;gt;money. Having a billion dollars of your own cash to put toward an election is idiotic and not nearly as powerful as having 1000 people investing a million dollars each of their own. You don&amp;#39;t lose all your cash if you lose and you now have 1000 cutthroats making sure you win so they can collect their returns with interest in the form of shady policy (think original documents of the TPP that required votes to be cast on withheld sections that could contain anything).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability to convince people that they should listen to what you have to say before they go looking at what the others have to offer. Charisma isn&amp;#39;t just the flare that catches peoples eyes though. It is contagious and addictive. Charisma makes people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to follow you instead of just being told to. Charisma creating the gateway to building support is historically seen to decline or grow due to many factors. An example may be presented as an aged man  naturally viewed as weaker and possibly not up to the stress of leadership in the last several years of unknown health, but this effect may be reversed to inspire by showing knowledge gained from years of passionate service in this field compared to other competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Coercion&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability to know what to say and how to say it to each group of people to elicit an emotional response of agreement, support, and finally action. The work of election support teams at each event extracts polling data from those attending so speech writers can tailor the verbiage just enough to keep smiles and cheers from the crowd while hopefully not contradicting previous statements. Simplified, the format usually goes in order of   &lt;strong&gt;Anger+Hope+Fear=Loyalty&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Anger&lt;/em&gt; is the easiest and most effective rallying varied groups into one unified mass working for one common goal. &lt;em&gt;Hope&lt;/em&gt; then comes advertised as being able to rely on the leaders genuine concern for every groups growing concerns with unflinching resolve. &lt;em&gt;Fear&lt;/em&gt; finally keeps people loyal. Just saying you could do a better job suggests your opponent might do something positive at all. Ensuring fear that electing someone else is a dire threat to your supporters most fundamental beliefs, way&amp;#39;s of life, and even safety keeps the uneducated and blindly bias loyal, dramatically aggressive to any opposition, and loudly promoting your brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_594zow", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/videos/comments/594zow/3_rules_for_rulers/d96ivlm/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/594zow/3_rules_for_rulers/", "name": "t1_d96ivlm", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/videos", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1477362780.0, "created_utc": 1477362780.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What's the single greatest feeling?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d95blba", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ThePurpleNinjaTurtle", "num_comments": 2714, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d94o2vh", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_gykki", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Sleep is very much addicting to me for 2 reasons that I find few if anyone else seems to have.\n\n1.
