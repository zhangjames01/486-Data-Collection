And you are free to label yourself however you want... But in the meantime, I'm gonna continue to be polyamorous.\n\nBy the way, many newbies to polyamory like to have rules in their relationships about who can sleep with who. I tell these couples that either the rules go away or you go back to being monogamous, eventually. I don't know of a single long-term, successful polyamorous relationship in which a couple has to give permission to each other for sexual relationships, and I would never date someone who gave me rules- it is a big red flag. \n\nI've seen some of my friends date newbies with rules, and it never had ended well, in 20+ years.\n\nYou do you, but ENM does not thrive when your body and sexual choices are owned by your partners. \n \nIt also severely limits your dating pool to other people new at polyamory, since you are a red flag and experienced people won't date you, leaving you to date other people new to polyamory with rules, turning into a downward spiral of short, tumultuous relationships with people you never really trust. \n\nI've seen this play out, many times. \n\nI suggest sitting down and talking to people who have successful, long-term relationships, and maybe even starting your poly journey by dating someone in a successful long term relationship to anybody exploring polyamory. \n\nAlso, SIDE NOTE: what is up with young people trying to create definitions for things and labeling everyone and everything? I hope that any non-monogamous but-not-quite-poly people feel comfortable in polyamorous spaces- along with anyone curious about, investigating, or dipping their toe into any form of non-monogamy.
