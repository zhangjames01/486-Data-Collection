Wages would not have been steadily increasing.\n\nIf wages go up but buying power goes down, what's the point?\n\nEx: In the early to mid 1900s, min wage was 1.25/h. In those 5 quarters was the equivalent of 1oz of Silver. Today, 1oz of Silver isn't near minimum wage at all. \"Money is too expensive to print!

It's outsourcing. It's foreign goods. It's the lack of mom and pop businesses.

The reason families are so hard to do is because everything is so expensive, and there isn't enough time in a day for  raising children and working; effect - outsourcing of child raising.
