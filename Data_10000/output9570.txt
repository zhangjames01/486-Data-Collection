First they are in a desert, then in a playground during the wintertime, and then.... they stared at a match? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pictured it in my head as the main character lying in the desert, looking up at the sun, having the sun fill their vision.....and then the screen fades to white and zooms out after a bit and you see the white becomes a bit of snow and through the snow you can see a kid on the playground trying to light a match while everyone else is playing--i.e. scene transition to a flashback. How could I make this more obvious? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for your advice though :) It&amp;#39;s enormously helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_104jo6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/writesomething/comments/104jo6/first_part_of_a_story_was_requested_in_iama_but_i/c6gbd0z/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/writesomething/comments/104jo6/first_part_of_a_story_was_requested_in_iama_but_i/", "name": "t1_c6gbd0z", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/writesomething", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1349151135.0, "created_utc": 1349151135.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/writesomething/comments/104jo6/first_part_of_a_story_was_requested_in_iama_but_i/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2v2qh", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "First part of a story.

Other times\u2026I envied them for their companionship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reached back into a pocket on my coat. I still had several matches left, probably enough to last me until recess was over, if I manage to shield the fire from the wind well enough this time. I took out the matchbox and lit another match in a well-practiced gesture, automatically moving my icy gloveless hand to block the threatening winds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo what are YOU up to, dweeb?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The small flame moved along the stick delicately, making sure to corrupt and char every single fiber of the match before moving further towards my fingers. I put my face closer to the match, losing myself in its blinding glow, tuning out everything else besides the light and its distinctive, smoky smell\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_parwy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/tf2/comments/parwy/ooh_mister_pyro/c3o58gu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/parwy/ooh_mister_pyro/", "name": "t1_c3o58gu", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tf2", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1328464303.0, "created_utc": 1328464303.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://i.imgur.com/Qt5F3.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh61", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I've had a male roommate for one whole day....
