But drastic situations call for drastic actions. \n\n&gt;\tI have been arguing in other comments for a balance. But to me, the key is still a balance.\n\nBut it\u2019s not about balance. This isn\u2019t an analog scale where both sides need to be equal, it\u2019s a pyramid with fundamental skills (found in academics and socializing) at the bottom and sports built on top. Hell, it is basically just Mazlow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. Sport can help you self actualize, but it\u2019s all meaningless if you can\u2019t put a roof over your head and be able to eat.  \n\nI was a middle school teacher before. I\u2019ve lived the experience where too many kids at the age of 12 don\u2019t know basic ass math skills. And yet we\u2019re expected to let them pursue their dreams of playing football or wrestling or whatever sport when they can\u2019t even tell me what 9x7 is, or what 13 - 2 is?! No lie, it was really hard to keep a straight face sometimes\u2026\n\nAt a certain point, hard course correction is necessary. Trying to slowly make changes is just gonna leave kids at 18 years old and unable to even handle a cashier job cause they can\u2019t math. \n\n&gt;\tBut if they just force her to leave gymnastics behind, that sends the message that nothing is worth investing in unless you are the best of the best in that thing, and once you aren\u2019t you may as well give it up. \n\nWell that\u2019s just clearly and logically not true. To have that as the conclusion to all of this is then also basically saying that the girl will come to the conclusion that her parents are failures too because they\u2019re not top of the top, when I mean\u2026 clearly not. Just look at how much they care and how many resources the entire family (which can\u2019t all be at the top of the top) have to offer; most people are proof that being successful doesn\u2019t require being the best of the best. \n\nWhen I was a teacher one of my favorite lessons was demystifying the misunderstanding of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. Too many people assume that to be \u201conly the best of the best succeed\u201d when that only applies in the macro scale of species. But within a single species it\u2019s \u201csurvival of the good enough\u201d, and I always emphasized that point to my students. Hell, what do you call a med school student who earns all Cs? Doctor. And that should be a lesson that the daughter will learn at her exact age, IF she\u2019s paying attention in class to her academics. \n\nI don\u2019t think that in the long run that it will deliver the message, especially once she also starts to socialize with other kids who are not the top 0.01% in a certain subject exceptional, and she\u2019ll learn the value of hard work and accomplishment even if you\u2019re not the best through school and academic endeavors. \n\nConsidering that these are really important formative years for core academic and social skills when she\u2019s incredibly behind as it is means the efficiency of that time is of the utmost importance. Drastic situations require immediate and usually drastic action. \n\nIf someone is running a 107 degree fever and we need to bring it down, do we use 100 degree water to bring it down or do we bring the ice?\n\nIf you accept my addiction parallel from earlier, then why isn\u2019t cutting out the addiction not a good move (clearly not including those addictions like alcoholism that have physical dependencies, where gymnastics is not)? People who \u201cslowly wean themselves off their addiction\u201d generally relapse, you can\u2019t wean someone off gambling slowly they just one day stop gambling (either out of choice or out of necessity). \n\n&gt;\tForcing her to quit gymnastics is especially unhelpful because as other commenters more knowledgeable about gymnastics than I am have mentioned, there are legitimate futures available to her as a result of gymnastics because the skills may be easily transferable to other sports, careers, etc.\n\nSo like I\u2019ve said elsewhere, she can choose to pick it up regardless of her parents wishes when she becomes an adult. I pursue my athletic goals as an adult even with my parents original blatant disdain and now acceptance and tolerance of it. But they also only came around because I could show them that it didn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t prevent me from achieving in terms of career, personal life, etc etc. \n\nAlso, why does it become the parents job to have to consider all of that when they see the immediate importance of academics? Shouldn\u2019t that be part of the daughter\u2019s research and arguments to convince the parents? I\u2019ll address it later below, but that\u2019s part of what makes it a privilege and not a right. A right would mean that the onus is on the parents to find a way to make it work when it\u2019s not, a privilege means the one who wants it has to do the legwork. \n\nIf the daughter can do the research and show the parents that there are these other outlets for not D1/Olympics gymnastics and shows she can get her addiction under control and show that she\u2019s capable of keeping up with her academics and socializing properly, you really think the parents would be that concerned? Maybe some of those non-sport specific skills are transferable, but you really think those skills couldn\u2019t be learned through other means? \n\n&gt;\tFor this girl, it seems especially insidious that the parents would lecture her about the fact that chasing a dream is a privilege not a right because they were fine with supporting her dream until her body changed as she grew older.\n\nThere\u2019s gotta be a point where you suddenly have a wake up call. She showed potential until she didn\u2019t, and you have to evolve your expectations along with it. Granted they should have been doing a better job of tempering the daughters expectation earlier, but damage is already done. And there are moments where it becomes a very quick and abrupt slap to the face. \n\nIf she got into a car accident and broke her leg, you really think that it\u2019s be messed up of the doctor to tell her she would never be competitive again? It\u2019s harsh but it\u2019s reality. And this isn\u2019t anywhere as severe as a broken leg, the daughter will have outlets to continue gymnastics if she can \u201crecover\u201d, would prolly be the best word to parallel between example and this situation. \n\nAlso, \u201csports is a privilege, not a right\u201d is the first thing they repeat over and over to you when you start sports in school. Literally on the daily announcements in middle school. It\u2019s also why you need to maintain a minimum GPA and no Ds, because that\u2019s just it: sports is 100% a privilege and not a right. It\u2019s because we as a society have agreed that by no means is sports ever more important than making sure you have fundamental skills. \n\nIf the parents fucked up historically by not expressing that to her that sucks, but it doesn\u2019t make it not true. \n\nAlso as I addressed above (no idea how I woulda weaved these two together) it\u2019s absolutely a privilege because the onus for being able to play sports is on the individual who wants to do it. If it were a right then the parents would have no right to say no, but they absolutely do. It\u2019s on the one who wants it (daughter) to prove that she should be allowed to have this opportunity.

As long as the parents truly have their kids best interests in mind and not just trying to live vicariously though their kids (hey, I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that) then you just have to hope that when they get older that they realize that perhaps some of the decisions were wrong but that the parents were doing their best. \n\n&gt;\tand I have had an uphill battle to get to where I am today, working on my second Master\u2019s degree and struggling now with arthritis in my late-20s\n\nHey, early congratulations on your master\u2019s degree.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that the parents have more or less helped dig the hole as deep as it stands, and that this is their wake up call. But drastic situations call for drastic actions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have been arguing in other comments for a balance. But to me, the key is still a balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it\u2019s not about balance. This isn\u2019t an analog scale where both sides need to be equal, it\u2019s a pyramid with fundamental skills (found in academics and socializing) at the bottom and sports built on top. Hell, it is basically just Mazlow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. Sport can help you self actualize, but it\u2019s all meaningless if you can\u2019t put a roof over your head and be able to eat.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was a middle school teacher before. I\u2019ve lived the experience where too many kids at the age of 12 don\u2019t know basic ass math skills. And yet we\u2019re expected to let them pursue their dreams of playing football or wrestling or whatever sport when they can\u2019t even tell me what 9x7 is, or what 13 - 2 is?! No lie, it was really hard to keep a straight face sometimes\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, hard course correction is necessary. Trying to slowly make changes is just gonna leave kids at 18 years old and unable to even handle a cashier job cause they can\u2019t math. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if they just force her to leave gymnastics behind, that sends the message that nothing is worth investing in unless you are the best of the best in that thing, and once you aren\u2019t you may as well give it up. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well that\u2019s just clearly and logically not true. To have that as the conclusion to all of this is then also basically saying that the girl will come to the conclusion that her parents are failures too because they\u2019re not top of the top, when I mean\u2026 clearly not. Just look at how much they care and how many resources the entire family (which can\u2019t all be at the top of the top) have to offer; most people are proof that being successful doesn\u2019t require being the best of the best. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was a teacher one of my favorite lessons was demystifying the misunderstanding of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. Too many people assume that to be \u201conly the best of the best succeed\u201d when that only applies in the macro scale of species. But within a single species it\u2019s \u201csurvival of the good enough\u201d, and I always emphasized that point to my students. Hell, what do you call a med school student who earns all Cs? Doctor. And that should be a lesson that the daughter will learn at her exact age, IF she\u2019s paying attention in class to her academics. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t think that in the long run that it will deliver the message, especially once she also starts to socialize with other kids who are not the top 0.01% in a certain subject exceptional, and she\u2019ll learn the value of hard work and accomplishment even if you\u2019re not the best through school and academic endeavors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering that these are really important formative years for core academic and social skills when she\u2019s incredibly behind as it is means the efficiency of that time is of the utmost importance. Drastic situations require immediate and usually drastic action. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If someone is running a 107 degree fever and we need to bring it down, do we use 100 degree water to bring it down or do we bring the ice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you accept my addiction parallel from earlier, then why isn\u2019t cutting out the addiction not a good move (clearly not including those addictions like alcoholism that have physical dependencies, where gymnastics is not)? People who \u201cslowly wean themselves off their addiction\u201d generally relapse, you can\u2019t wean someone off gambling slowly they just one day stop gambling (either out of choice or out of necessity). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Forcing her to quit gymnastics is especially unhelpful because as other commenters more knowledgeable about gymnastics than I am have mentioned, there are legitimate futures available to her as a result of gymnastics because the skills may be easily transferable to other sports, careers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So like I\u2019ve said elsewhere, she can choose to pick it up regardless of her parents wishes when she becomes an adult. I pursue my athletic goals as an adult even with my parents original blatant disdain and now acceptance and tolerance of it. But they also only came around because I could show them that it didn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t prevent me from achieving in terms of career, personal life, etc etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, why does it become the parents job to have to consider all of that when they see the immediate importance of academics? Shouldn\u2019t that be part of the daughter\u2019s research and arguments to convince the parents? I\u2019ll address it later below, but that\u2019s part of what makes it a privilege and not a right. A right would mean that the onus is on the parents to find a way to make it work when it\u2019s not, a privilege means the one who wants it has to do the legwork. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the daughter can do the research and show the parents that there are these other outlets for not D1/Olympics gymnastics and shows she can get her addiction under control and show that she\u2019s capable of keeping up with her academics and socializing properly, you really think the parents would be that concerned? Maybe some of those non-sport specific skills are transferable, but you really think those skills couldn\u2019t be learned through other means? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For this girl, it seems especially insidious that the parents would lecture her about the fact that chasing a dream is a privilege not a right because they were fine with supporting her dream until her body changed as she grew older.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s gotta be a point where you suddenly have a wake up call. She showed potential until she didn\u2019t, and you have to evolve your expectations along with it. Granted they should have been doing a better job of tempering the daughters expectation earlier, but damage is already done. And there are moments where it becomes a very quick and abrupt slap to the face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she got into a car accident and broke her leg, you really think that it\u2019s be messed up of the doctor to tell her she would never be competitive again? It\u2019s harsh but it\u2019s reality. And this isn\u2019t anywhere as severe as a broken leg, the daughter will have outlets to continue gymnastics if she can \u201crecover\u201d, would prolly be the best word to parallel between example and this situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, \u201csports is a privilege, not a right\u201d is the first thing they repeat over and over to you when you start sports in school. Literally on the daily announcements in middle school. It\u2019s also why you need to maintain a minimum GPA and no Ds, because that\u2019s just it: sports is 100% a privilege and not a right. It\u2019s because we as a society have agreed that by no means is sports ever more important than making sure you have fundamental skills. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the parents fucked up historically by not expressing that to her that sucks, but it doesn\u2019t make it not true. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also as I addressed above (no idea how I woulda weaved these two together) it\u2019s absolutely a privilege because the onus for being able to play sports is on the individual who wants to do it. If it were a right then the parents would have no right to say no, but they absolutely do. It\u2019s on the one who wants it (daughter) to prove that she should be allowed to have this opportunity. The government doesn\u2019t just give me a driver\u2019s license because I turn 16, &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; am the one who has to prove it by passing the driver\u2019s test. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Making her give up the thing she loves won\u2019t automatically make her better at other things, but it will definitely make her resent her parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be fair, teenagers in general are going to resent their parents decisions and control over their lives no matter what.
