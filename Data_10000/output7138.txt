But often I&amp;#39;ll be nervous and mess up inputs during the beginning and possible end of the set when certain thoughts come in that ultimately don&amp;#39;t matter to the game, typical things like the score, how many stocks I have or what my stock/percent deficit it, or what my history with a specific player is. Obviously none of this matters during the game (percent/damage do matter because they change combos but they should only be viewed as that, not as &amp;quot;oh shit I have to make a huge comeback.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I guess what I&amp;#39;m really looking for isn&amp;#39;t so much for &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; state, but a little extra push/discipline in terms of focusing on things that matter in the game, like spacing, opponent&amp;#39;s habits, and percents (for combos, not to see how down I am), while ignoring other things like how much I&amp;#39;m losing by or what the set count is or what my history with this player is.
