Flowchart says Barclays AA Biz, but I value UR higher. Mainly looking for reassurance that Chase will even approve me and that the timing would work out. If things wouldn't work out, I'm looking for alternatives.\n\n**(2) Credit score**\n\n- CreditKarma: 744 TU / 744 EQ\n- Chase Credit Journey: 737\n- Experian FICO 8: 752\n\n**(3) Card history**\n\n- Local CU - 02/2017\n- CFU - 04/2020\n- (Auto Loan - 07/2020, seems relevant)\n- CFF - 10/23/2020\n  - This is already reflected in my scores\n\n**(4) How much natural spend in 3 months?**\n\n- Natural spend is normally ~$2.5k in 3mo.\n- P2 has tuition payments we can put on card for 3% fee:\n  - $6.5k in beginning of January\n  - $4k in May\n  - $6k in September\n  - $2.5k the following January\n- I believe I can put another ~$3k in 3mo. towards rent using PPK for 1% fee (without using Plastiq) or without PPK for 3%.\n- I've never prepaid taxes or done the GC-&gt;MO/BB/Serve dance. I'm hesitant to do either without trying out small amounts first, so I'm probably not doing either of those soon.\n\n**(5) Willing to MS?**\n\n   See above.\n\n**(6) Open to business cards?**\n\nYes, but it's more of a \"business\". I've worked full-time as a software developer for ~2.5yrs, part-time for ~1.5yrs before that. Have done a little moonlighting during those 4yrs, but revenue is inconsistent at best.\nThink I can claim 4 years in business and $2k in revenue. No previous business cards.\n\n**(7) Interested in several cards?**\n\nI'm willing to get several, but planning on staying under 5/24. Want CSR and/or CSP in time to cash out UR for a fun trip after P2's graduation in about a year and a half. Also considering a mortgage at about that time.\n\n**(8) What are you targeting?**   \n\nI guess points. SW Companion Pass is pretty worthless to me.\nI usually fly economy, but if it's a long flight, I could be persuaded to upgrade.\nReally whatever gets me the most value towards things I was already planning on buying.\nUR seem great for transferring to Hyatt hotels. It looks like MR transfers well to Delta.\n\n**(9) Existing points/miles?**\n\n60k UR, 8k Delta SkyMiles\n\n**(10) Which airport?**\n\nSLC, so I prioritize DL, then AA, then I guess UA or SW\n\n**(11) Where to?**\n\n- Cancun (Looking at the Hyatt Zilara Cancun ~1.5yr from now)\n- Hawaii\n- Other Caribbean destinations\n- Banff\n- Other domestic travel\n\n\n**As for why Chase may/may not approve me, I can see these being possible reasons:**\n\n- Velocity\n  - Planning on waiting until 12/23/2020 so that it's been 2mo., but then I don't have a lot of time to recon and get the card (expedited) before Jan. payment is due.
