It was really a game on training wheels, and the true predecessor to WoW.  \n\nBut it did 2 things VERY well, and deserves mention for it. First and foremost was the lore, which was really completely ahead of its time in every way. Second was injecting that lore into the game to create extremely compelling experiences.  \n\nCrushbone--at a very early level ( you could probably enter as early as level 8 - 10 which is roughly equivalent to ESO )--was sort of the pantheon of that design philosophy.  \n\nIt was an orcish lair nestled beneath the high wood elf tree village. When you entered, you were in a zone with a lumbering mountain right in the middle. The orcs surrounding this mountain would be the correct challenge for the least seasoned adventurers. With a group, you could make your way up the hill, gaining experience, and finally challenging the top dog of the hill. If you were able to take out this orcish general, he had a chance to drop the \"Shiny Brass Shield,\" an item that would cause your character to emit a glow.  \n\nAs you progressed through the zone gaining more experience you would fight harder and harder enemies. Eventually getting far enough in the zone would reveal a large castle-like orc fortress. Inside was Emporer Crush and his evil dark elf ambassador DVinn. A few nights spent in the zone with competent parties might mean finally besting that duo.  \n\nYou'd be around level 20 - 22 at that time, and most likely head over to the Estate of Unrest, a haunting hedge maze filled with ghastly hags, ghouls, and scarecrows.  \n\nNow, the funny thing about all of this is that over the years we've learned to COMPRESS all of this. ESO really succeeds at taking all of these factors and sort of giving you the \"tapas\" version if you will.  \n\nESO is kind of the bite-sized version of this experience.  \n\nCraglorn presumably will offer the main course version.  \n\nFor anyone who has played WoW recently, the new Scholomance is really the most evolved version of this design philosophy.  \n\nYou witness rich lore unfold as you progress the dungeon, in a group of peers, with dynamic and fun fights &amp; mechanics, and it can all be accomplished in 30 minutes or less.  \n\nI gather that ESO was shooting for this, but with their poor use (or lackthereof) of instancing, we don't witness a smooth and scripted event play out.  \n\nInstead we see a boss spawn, yell some profane utterings, and then before we are even out of the room he spawns again and reads the same exact script.  \n\nIn order to understand if you haven't played the NEW scholomance maybe try watching a YouTube video.  \n\n\n\n", "edited": 1400080093.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crushbone for me really epitomizes the contribution EQ made to the MMO genre.
