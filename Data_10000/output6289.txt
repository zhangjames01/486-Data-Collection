Linklater and Clifton said there are rural PCPs who are currently qualified to work as ACPs. \n\nThe Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service has its own training program for staff who want to become ACPs. Jobs in the private sector are scarce. \n\nRRC\u2019s ACP program costs about $15,000, and no one wants to spend that much money when jobs aren\u2019t available, said Clifton, an intermediate care paramedic based in the Interlake. \n\nA paramedic echoed that sentiment. \n\n\u201cWhy would people want to spend that money and time when there\u2019s no future?

Enrolment in RRC\u2019s current primary care paramedicine class is believed to be about 60 per cent, say paramedics who spoke to the Free Press.

Aside from career progression, Linklater said paramedicine would be more appealing if rural staff had a contract and high wages. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rural paramedics are among the allied health-care professionals who\u2019ve been without a contract for about five years. The MAHCP regularly receives calls from paramedics who are leaving the profession or taking jobs in Winnipeg, said Linklater.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The staff shortage is contributing to high levels of stress and burnout among staff, with ambulances being forced out of service and response times increasing, the union said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without real solutions, the crisis will continue for years, Clifton warned. She described the province\u2019s plan to hire 35 additional PCPs as a \u201cdrop in the bucket,\u201d arguing 150 to 200 more paramedics are needed in rural Manitoba alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shared Health, which oversees Manitoba\u2019s emergency medical services, is committed to addressing the staff shortage, boosting intake at RRC and offering career advancement opportunities, a spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe are working with RRC Polytechnic to promote the next advanced care paramedic program intake, to ensure the intake is posted on time and that applicants are aware of new prerequisites that were added when the winter semester ACP program was posted later than usual,\u201d the spokesman wrote in an email.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zhz5m0", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Winnipeg/comments/zhz5m0/no_applicants_for_advanced_paramedic_course_at/izoomd6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Winnipeg/comments/zhz5m0/no_applicants_for_advanced_paramedic_course_at/", "name": "t1_izoomd6", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Winnipeg", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1670696053.0, "created_utc": 1670696053.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/2022/12/09/no-applicants-for-advanced-paramedic-course-at-rrc"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ru32", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "GDT -
