Yes I have a decent amount experience with trademark law in my law practice.  Seems like Take-Two has picked up where Monster Cable left off in the late 1990s early 2000 (they went after everyone with monster in the name). \n\nNot sure why /r/GuyWithRealFakeFacts is being downvoted, he is correct.  Unlike with copyright law where you can be a bit more choosey in how you enforce, with trademark law every time you *don\u2019t* enforce your trademark, it chips away at your rights.  That said, some go overboard like Monster Cables did back in the day.\n\nA brief explanation on trademarks: when you file a trademark you are filing in a particular class of goods/services.  The point of a trademark is that just by looking at the mark you can immediately know who manufactured the goods or is providing the service.  A good example of a non-word mark trademark is the Nike swoosh.  If you see that on a product, you would assume it is a Nike product.\n\nThe Nice Agreement sets what goes into each class so that trademarks have the same classes when you register in multiple countries ([list of classes and their goods/services for the curious](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/trademark-updates-and-announcements/nice-agreement-current-edition-version-general-remarks)). Like Patents, you have to register a Trademark country by country.  They don\u2019t automatically cross boundaries like copyrights do (to the extent the country is a member of WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization).  Class 1-34 are for goods, 35-45 services.\n\nYou can have the same mark owned by different people if they have different classes or the goods/services are sufficiently different.  For instance DOVE Chocolate and DOVE soap can coexist even though they are owned by different companies.  You can even have multiple variations of the same mark registered in the same class of goods if the class is broad enough. This happens a lot in Class 35 that covers Advertising; business management, organization and administration; AND office functions services. Sidenote: that is advertising services for other people/companies, not your own advertising (common rejection for people trying to register an advertising service).\n\nMost stand alone software (i.e. not Software as a service), including video games, falls under Class 9 which covers scientific equipment, computer equipment, and software.  Class 9 is another class that you can end up with similar marks with very different goods in the same class, though not quite as much as 35.\n\nA very common reason a trademark filing is rejected, and how you can end up with trademark infringement between a registered mark and a non-registered mark, is if a mark would be confusingly similar to a consumer and therefore misidentify where the goods are coming from.  A mark of NIKE\u00c9 for shoes would be confusingly similar with NIKE for instance.  \n\nYou can also have two marks be confusingly similar even if they aren\u2019t in the same class of goods/services if one of the marks is so strong that any use of it would be thought to be made by the first company.  COCA-COLA is an example of a mark that is so strong that even if you are trying to register the mark in a class not already used by the beverage company, say musical instruments, your average consumer would assume a COCA-COLA branded violin was made by the Coca-Cola beverage company.\n\nAs Take-Two seems to be going after more than just video game companies, they seem to believe their mark is strong enough to transcend classes.  That said, both Take-Two and the video game It Takes Two are within the same class (company that produces video games and a video game, both class 9) so this isn\u2019t a stretch like some of their other suits.  As they are in the same class and even the same industry, Take-Two honestly has to go after It Takes Two in order to preserve their trademark.  It is a terrible outcome but that is how the law is written.\n\nHow successful this will all be, that I can\u2019t say as I do trademarks on the transactional side of things. I file trademarks and respond to office actions with the USPTO (and trademarks are maybe 10-15% of what I do).  I don\u2019t deal with litigation.\n\nLong winded explanation, but hopefully that all helps.  That is however the short explanation.  There is a reason why some attorneys do only trademarks.\n\nEdit: typos and clarification", "edited": 1638654963.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "62", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah trademark law.
