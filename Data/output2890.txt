Without oxygen the physical body you die.  \n\nThe mind body could be considered your thoughts and what give you personal characteristics. What foods you like, what activities you like. Without the mind we wouldn't know the difference between north east south west or what time you need to get to your hair appointment by. \n\nThe emotional body or instinctual body is doing all the things in your body without you having to control them. Like beating your heart, telling you when you need to eat or poop or pee. This could be considered the body that feels things like love, hate, happiness, trust, boredom, fear, surprise, ect. \n\nThe last body is very subjective and the definition may vary from person to person. So this is my spin on it. Bliss body could be considered the **relationship** body. So like when emotions are transmuted between two humans. Being in sync; sharing the exact same emotion with another human.\n\nSo my suggestion for starting out would be to start practicing connecting the first two bodies. Your physical body and the Breath body. \n\nHow do you do this?\n\nSimply connect your breath with the movement of your physical body.\n\nStand up, start to feel all four corners of your feet pressing into the floor, allow the fingers to hang heavy by your sides, feel the crown of you head floating toward the ceiling. \nTake a deep breath in and exhale all the air out of your lungs. Slowly start to inhale the arms out to the sides and up overhead. The fingers should be pointing toward the ceiling as you finish fully inhaling. Exhale slowly lowering the arms to the sides. Sync the movement of your arms with the breath, fully exhaling all the air in your lungs and and lowering the arms to your sides simultaneously. \n\nThats basically all there is to it. When in a yoga class *focus on your breath* with more attention than you give the instructor. Flow in and out of poses according to your breath and if the instructor is going faster than your flow **do not** speed up for them. Yoga instructors are there to guide you, and are not there to tell you want to do. \n\nTL;DR Connect your movement with your breath. Fully inhaling and fully exhaling and inhaling in and out of each pose. Intuitively your body already knows how to move. Simply concentrate on the breath with movement and your body will eventually take care of the rest.\n\nEdit: misspelling and such\n", "edited": 1417476637.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey buddy =) \nWelcome to the world of yoga. \nThere is a lot to yoga than stretching. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider this: The human body is made up of 5 separate bodies all working together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Physical body\n2) Breath body\n3) Thinking body\n4) Emotional body\n5) Bliss body (this one goes so deep it cannot be described with words)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Physical body is your flesh, bones, blood, muscles, ect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Breath body is the air that circulates throughout the body.

So this is my spin on it. Bliss body could be considered the &lt;strong&gt;relationship&lt;/strong&gt; body. So like when emotions are transmuted between two humans. Being in sync; sharing the exact same emotion with another human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my suggestion for starting out would be to start practicing connecting the first two bodies. Your physical body and the Breath body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you do this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simply connect your breath with the movement of your physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stand up, start to feel all four corners of your feet pressing into the floor, allow the fingers to hang heavy by your sides, feel the crown of you head floating toward the ceiling. \nTake a deep breath in and exhale all the air out of your lungs. Slowly start to inhale the arms out to the sides and up overhead. The fingers should be pointing toward the ceiling as you finish fully inhaling. Exhale slowly lowering the arms to the sides. Sync the movement of your arms with the breath, fully exhaling all the air in your lungs and and lowering the arms to your sides simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thats basically all there is to it. When in a yoga class &lt;em&gt;focus on your breath&lt;/em&gt; with more attention than you give the instructor. Flow in and out of poses according to your breath and if the instructor is going faster than your flow &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; speed up for them. Yoga instructors are there to guide you, and are not there to tell you want to do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Connect your movement with your breath. Fully inhaling and fully exhaling and inhaling in and out of each pose. Intuitively your body already knows how to move. Simply concentrate on the breath with movement and your body will eventually take care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: misspelling and such&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2nyno6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/yoga/comments/2nyno6/just_starting_out/cmic1ja/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/2nyno6/just_starting_out/", "name": "t1_cmic1ja", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/yoga", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1417476291.0, "created_utc": 1417476291.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/2nyno6/just_starting_out/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhq6", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How many of you quit lifting and took up only Yoga?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 12, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "yoga", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cmias62", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Bewildered_vagabond", "num_comments": 41, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_2nxsta", "score": 12, "author_fullname": "t2_71esk", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Consider this: Craving can be prevalent in the weight lifting community.
