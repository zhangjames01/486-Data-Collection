Seriously. It has answers to all of your questions.\n\nBut tl;dr:\n\n1. Set a goal. either fat loss or strength or cardio gain. Make it [smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).\n2. Weight loss happens through calorie deficit. That is it. Estimate your daily calories burned, track how many you take it, and adjust by -500 to lose weight. It doesn't matter when you eat in relation to your workout. Eat enough protein (~.75g per lb of body weight)\n3. Do your exercises. Don't lose the forest for the trees. Ultimately what matters when starting is that you actually build the habit. Whether this workout is 5% more efficient than that workout, or eating at this time burns more fat than at this time (protip: no it doesn't), doesn't matter at all when you start.\n4. Yes, you can build muscle and burn fat.
