The one that makes the most visible difference is weight loss, so I'll explain that first. My diet changes were very slow, first I started focusing on eating more vegetables, then choosing healthier meals in general (grilled chicken instead of fried, not getting french fries as a side, eating pizza 1-2 times a month instead of twice a week), finally I started cutting down on desserts. Now I eat dessert a couple times a month. I also make exceptions for special occasions (at Christmas and Thanksgiving I didn't really worry about calories but I made sure to eat lots of protein and veggies).\n\nThe first 10 pounds I lost just because I was eating healthier and moving more, but after that when I decided to get serious, I cut my calories to 1200-1400 a day. My BMR was about 1400, and my TDEE was around 1900 at that point, so that was a deficit of about 500-700 which is on the steeper side but I didn't really know what I was doing. [If you don't know your BMR, here's a calculator!](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/) I'd say aim for a deficit of around 500 but there's some debate on the topic. I ate lots of broccoli and spinach since I was worried about getting enough vitamins. Also chicken. And I drank a TON of water. Repeat until you are the desired weight :) Like I said to someone else, I think it's important not to deny yourself everything, but treats should be small! Like, under 100 calories. A piece of chocolate, not a whole chocolate bar. Stuff like that.\n\nThe other part of it was working out, to try and keep as much muscle mass as possible while cutting my body fat percentage. Also it's really cool to be stronger than I was before, even if that's only reflected in small ways. I tried a bunch of different things for exercise, but what I liked best was playing tennis with my boyfriend for cardio (because it's fun, not work) and the /r/bodyweightfitness workouts (because the progressions were a way to quantify my progress). Also someone on that sub made this [awesome website](http://www.fitloop.co/), which makes it really easy to do the workouts because they have videos demonstrating everything. And it's a great community in general.\n\nThis is just what worked for me! I think the key is to find stuff you already like, or goals you have, and focus on that. If you hate spinach, don't force yourself to eat it, since you'll just be miserable. Find healthy food you like and learn to make it. Find a style or type of workout that you love, and everything will flow that much easier. And don't be afraid to keep trying new things! Finally, loving your body and having the goal of making it even better is a preferable mental place to hating your body. Cause I mean, bodies are pretty spectacular, and the things they can do are amazing!\n\nI hope this novel-length response answered your question :) Feel free to ask me anything else!
