I get the feeling this question shows up there a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of debate surrounding linguistic freedom versus political correctness. Some people see the use of &amp;quot;nigger&amp;quot; as a way for black people to retake or &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; the word that was used against their people for centuries, some would argue that it&amp;#39;s too hateful for anyone to say, and some people would prefer complete freedom of speech over anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m too white and suburban to have experience with the issue, which is why I suggest you expand your search for an answer to a group that&amp;#39;s as diverse as possible. Every opinion seems to have a valid basis, but none of them ever really make headway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1s0m8d", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1s0m8d/eli5_why_is_it_racist_to_use_the_word_nigger_if/cdsv6lb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1s0m8d/eli5_why_is_it_racist_to_use_the_word_nigger_if/", "name": "t1_cdsv6lb", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/explainlikeimfive", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1386111377.0, "created_utc": 1386111377.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1s0m8d/eli5_why_is_it_racist_to_use_the_word_nigger_if/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "ELI5: If digital things are coded in binary, is it possible to code in binary to create something?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "link_author": "AngelMCMXCIV", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cdsuwiq", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "MrDerpleton", "num_comments": 13, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cdstaa1", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4khwx", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes.
