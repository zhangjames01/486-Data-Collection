I think what has happened is that as marketing has become digital, employers are focused on only hiring those who have the hard experience in these digital skills regardless if they know or care about marketing.

That is a tool. \n\nMarketing at its basic level is figuring out who your buyer is, what sorts of products they'd appreciate and how you can communicate value to them. Of course if you want to go further it's about building a brand and creating a long term relationship with your consumers and your brand. Stuff like that is the reason I studied marketing in college.
