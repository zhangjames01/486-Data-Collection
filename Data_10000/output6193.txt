When you&amp;#39;re broke enough to be on SNAP and fully subsidized healthcare, it&amp;#39;s really easy to be put in a situation where getting a raise means losing those, but the raise is absolutely not enough to cover what you were receiving in benefits from the government. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, in my state, you can have an income up to $1396 a month as an individual and receive SNAP, and you get $194 per month for groceries. At minimum wage here, that&amp;#39;s about 29 hours per week, so any raise that&amp;#39;s less than $1.50 per hour, or $2,328 per year will put you over the limit without being enough compensation to make up the difference. Most places, you&amp;#39;d be lucky to get a $0.50 raise as a CoL adjustment, so you&amp;#39;re realistically looking at not taking that raise this year (and it won&amp;#39;t increase next year) or losing $1 per hour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;#39;s how you&amp;#39;ve seen your parents and family members have to treat getting a raise for your entire life, or you&amp;#39;ve had to live through it, it can definitely leave the impression that &amp;quot;Making more money actually means making less money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zy5kmq", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/zy5kmq/what_fact_are_you_just_tired_of_explaining_to/j276jl6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zy5kmq/what_fact_are_you_just_tired_of_explaining_to/", "name": "t1_j276jl6", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1672370752.0, "created_utc": 1672370752.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zy5kmq/what_fact_are_you_just_tired_of_explaining_to/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3v", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "U/lumenphosphor describes how \u201ctimelessness\u201d and \u201ctaste\u201d in fashion are often marketing ploys steeped in classism", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "bestof", "link_author": "OldHagFashion", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j26cn68", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Sat-AM", "num_comments": 106, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j264z5s", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_f4fea", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Growing up in the south, Levi's had about the same (or higher) status as Wrangler in the good ole boy circles.
