It's possible, but it's not going to be very easy. I would wait until you have more money for starters. I'm happy to continue discussing if you want, but I have a couple questions for you. \n\nWhat is your plan for distribution? Will you be pick-up only? If you're delivering, will it be just you? Many customers won't want to help you deliver their mattress, especially if they pay for delivery. \n\nWhat location will you use to sell? How prominent is it? Will you have to pay rent?  \n\nHow do you plan to advertise? The online box mattresses are rapidly grabbing market share and I suspect they have a decent foothold in your community.  \n\nWhat is your inventory strategy? It doesn't seem like you have enough capital to keep much of anything on hand (I would think that most of the $8k would go towards furnishing your showroom, not including possible rent.). \n\nHow do you plan on paying yourself? With such little starting capital, you're going to be funneling a lot of your money back into the business for a couple months at least. Can you survive the next 6 months with zero (or possibly negative) personal income?   \n\nWho is going to manage your books? Do you have accounting experience? I doubt you'll be able to get a loan, so you won't have to deal with that, but you'll still have to deal with managing COGS, inventory, taxes, and a bunch of other things you're not going to want to figure out on the fly while selling mattresses during the day and delivering at night. If you think you can hire an accountant, where is that money going to come from? You can't just manage that stuff at tax time, you'll have to deal with collecting tax on an ongoing basis, etc. \n\nHow are you going to accept payment? Are you going to be able to take cards? If so, you'll need to be prepared to go through the process of getting a terminal. Are you going to offer credit? Either you'll need to somehow have cash reserves on hand to be able to self-finance or you'll need to partner with a financing company. If you're only going to take cash, be prepared to be audited, so you better have everything buttoned up.  \n\nAre you prepared to incorporate and apply for a business license? To get business accounts set up at a bank? There are a lot of steps to go through depending on your state and municipality, and it usually has to happen before you even sell your first mattress. \n\nMost importantly, are you prepared to work your fingers to the bone? Are you ready for long days where angry people come into your store and push you to the edge all day long, and then you have to spend 3 hours delivering beds that night. Are you prepared for days where no one steps foot in your store and you're bored and terrified that you're going to fail because you haven't had a sale in three days and rent is due?  \n\nYou say you know about the industry, but what is your experience? Can you sell? Can you run a business? You've gotta be EVERYTHING when you start a mattress store. And having $15k doesn't seem like anywhere near enough cushion to have time to learn from mistakes.  \n\nI'm also concerned about the opportunity in your area. The fact that there is a retailer in the area that sells mattresses, but they haven't expanded their offering begs the question as to why? They already have things set up. Are they just stupid? And if they are somehow oblivious to this opportunity, how hard would it be for them to pivot and sell more once you prove the concept?  \n\nI love that you have drive and interest in the mattress business. It's great to be a self starter and to work for yourself. You're in a great position as an 18 year old with $15k. But don't throw it away on a pipe dream without thinking through all the variables. It's tough to run a business. It's even tougher as a young person. I started as a 22 year old with a business degree and I still had a hard time getting people to take me seriously because of my age. I'd recommend saving your money. Another opportunity will come along when you're better prepared to deal with it.  \n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions. \n\n", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend this, especially without knowing you better. It&amp;#39;s possible, but it&amp;#39;s not going to be very easy. I would wait until you have more money for starters. I&amp;#39;m happy to continue discussing if you want, but I have a couple questions for you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is your plan for distribution? Will you be pick-up only? If you&amp;#39;re delivering, will it be just you? Many customers won&amp;#39;t want to help you deliver their mattress, especially if they pay for delivery. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What location will you use to sell? How prominent is it? Will you have to pay rent?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you plan to advertise? The online box mattresses are rapidly grabbing market share and I suspect they have a decent foothold in your community.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is your inventory strategy? It doesn&amp;#39;t seem like you have enough capital to keep much of anything on hand (I would think that most of the $8k would go towards furnishing your showroom, not including possible rent.). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How do you plan on paying yourself? With such little starting capital, you&amp;#39;re going to be funneling a lot of your money back into the business for a couple months at least. Can you survive the next 6 months with zero (or possibly negative) personal income?   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Who is going to manage your books? Do you have accounting experience? I doubt you&amp;#39;ll be able to get a loan, so you won&amp;#39;t have to deal with that, but you&amp;#39;ll still have to deal with managing COGS, inventory, taxes, and a bunch of other things you&amp;#39;re not going to want to figure out on the fly while selling mattresses during the day and delivering at night. If you think you can hire an accountant, where is that money going to come from? You can&amp;#39;t just manage that stuff at tax time, you&amp;#39;ll have to deal with collecting tax on an ongoing basis, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How are you going to accept payment? Are you going to be able to take cards? If so, you&amp;#39;ll need to be prepared to go through the process of getting a terminal. Are you going to offer credit? Either you&amp;#39;ll need to somehow have cash reserves on hand to be able to self-finance or you&amp;#39;ll need to partner with a financing company. If you&amp;#39;re only going to take cash, be prepared to be audited, so you better have everything buttoned up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are you prepared to incorporate and apply for a business license? To get business accounts set up at a bank? There are a lot of steps to go through depending on your state and municipality, and it usually has to happen before you even sell your first mattress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, are you prepared to work your fingers to the bone? Are you ready for long days where angry people come into your store and push you to the edge all day long, and then you have to spend 3 hours delivering beds that night. Are you prepared for days where no one steps foot in your store and you&amp;#39;re bored and terrified that you&amp;#39;re going to fail because you haven&amp;#39;t had a sale in three days and rent is due?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You say you know about the industry, but what is your experience? Can you sell? Can you run a business? You&amp;#39;ve gotta be EVERYTHING when you start a mattress store. And having $15k doesn&amp;#39;t seem like anywhere near enough cushion to have time to learn from mistakes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also concerned about the opportunity in your area. The fact that there is a retailer in the area that sells mattresses, but they haven&amp;#39;t expanded their offering begs the question as to why? They already have things set up. Are they just stupid? And if they are somehow oblivious to this opportunity, how hard would it be for them to pivot and sell more once you prove the concept?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love that you have drive and interest in the mattress business. It&amp;#39;s great to be a self starter and to work for yourself. You&amp;#39;re in a great position as an 18 year old with $15k. But don&amp;#39;t throw it away on a pipe dream without thinking through all the variables. It&amp;#39;s tough to run a business. It&amp;#39;s even tougher as a young person. I started as a 22 year old with a business degree and I still had a hard time getting people to take me seriously because of my age. I&amp;#39;d recommend saving your money.
