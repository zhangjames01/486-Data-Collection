I am also a fit man, I have been skinny all my life and for a long time I had no idea how truly hard it is for my girlfriend. In our first year of dating I always let her know how beautiful she is(she truly is) and how happy she makes me, but one day when I was telling her how beautiful she is. She cut me off and told me to stop calling her beautiful and that it's a lie and I am too blind to see so I don't really know what I am talking about. Even though its true my eyesight is really bad to the point where glasses no longer help me. I quickly replied and told her that even though my eyesight is not at 20/20 I can see things clearly when they are close to my face and since I am usually on your face half the time I can see you clearly, but she begged me to stop and almost started to cry. It dawned on me that she is self-conscience of her body and not once she never saw her self beautiful. I just assumed that she was fine with her body, and being skinny all my life I have no idea what is like to be fat in western society, especially what women go through. After she pleaded she began to tell me that she was once skinny in high school and even joined her high school varsity baseball and volleyball and she was insanely good. However she started to gain weight and continued to gain weight throughout college and yet despite all her efforts of dieting and exercise she was barely losing weight so she gave up. She continued ever since the weight gain she never saw herself pretty and the last time she did was over nine years ago. She hate it how people sometime give her these looks when she buys fast food for me, the look that says \"She is too fat. She needs to eat something else\". They assumed it was hers and she doesn't even eat fast food. She cringes at the idea of shopping for clothes because whenever she goes out to buy clothes to look nice for me for our date, she can only find the perfect dress at size 10 or less, and she begins to feel ugly again and feels she doesn't deserve to be with a guy like me and I deserve someone that is not a size 16. It also doesn't help that her mom always tells her dieting tips and that she looked like she gained more weight from time to time, and to make matters worse a random guy passed by us while walking to Publix and said to me \"Hey buddy you can do so much better then her\" I got pissed and quickly snapped at him \"How dare you disrespect my girl like that, she is hot and if you dare to rebuttal I will put you in your place.\" After my girlfriend reminded me what happened at Publix she told me she felt the most ugliest person in the world and these are just the few examples of many. At that point she started to break down and I hugged her and held unto her. I was in shock that I had no idea that she was going through this and I should have done more to help her. I told her I am not going to stop calling her beautiful and I will be with you. You mean to me more than anyone and anything in this world and I don't see anyone else but you and you alone. I will always be here for you and I am really sorry that I wasn't aware you were going through this.\n\nWe have been together to two years now and I plan to propose to her soon, and it took my girlfriend awhile to believe that I actually see her beautiful but some doubts remain however. To all the guys who are with plus size girls, You just have to be there for your girl when the low self esteem gets to her, and you have to let her vent all whats on her mind and have it off her chest. Once she sees that you are still listening, supportive, and showing her you really love her through your actions. It will help open her eyes that she really is sexy and shouldn't be ashamed by a simple look from judgmental eyes. \n\nFor all the plus size girls you really are beautiful. Don't let society tell you that fat is ugly and you are inferior. You are far from it, you are strong. Stop underestimating yourself you mean more to those around you than some skinny chick you see passing by. If your boyfriend say that you are beautiful, sexy and hot. It is really the truth and words only fail to truly express the emphasis of the purity in the truth of your beauty. \n\nEDIT: Fix grammar errors, sorry about that I got caught with the stingy memories \n\nTL:DR\nIf you care for your girlfriend who are on the plus size you should really read this.", "edited": 1312732773.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am madly in love with a woman who weighs over 220lbs and her height is 5&amp;#39;5&amp;quot;, and too make things more difficult she has very low self-esteem.
