Djinn are real\n2. Black magic is real\n3. Amals are real attempts derived from a long history of experiment/trial/error of using halal sources to undo black magic or the action of djinns, most of which came from prophetic medicine as experimented with by those who later left followers in the form of sufi-type tariqas and some of which came from Muslims learning how black magic was done (usually by people who engaged in these things then later converted to Islam and then used what they understood to try and undo the effects of it). To them it's the same as using science or modern medicine, in that they experiment with something until it works (and use something of the disease to design a cure), they just need 'ilm to make sure they are not crossing any lines into shirk or disbelief. For some of these people, these things aren't taken on faith, they literally have perception of djinns. This makes it all the more important to stick with rightly guided people, because I've met tons of people like this in Pakistan, including some who were not 'ulema, but sometimes worked with or for 'ulema, but then who would also on the side take money to do black magic as well (playing both sides, whoever could pay them, because what they were offering was in demand).\n4. We don't know what is or isn't a real amal, unless you know it yourself or personally know these people. You're definitely unlikely to find out anything meaningful over public/anonymous postings online.\n\nThe most basic things are reading Al-Falaq/An-Nas/Ayat al-Kursi, etc. Even if these people may qualify as \"experts\" because of their knowledge/training, you're still technically under no obligation to listen to them, just as how you're under no obligation to listen to a doctor or a scientist. There's no \"taqleed\" in medicine beyond what is common sense in everyday usage.\n\nAnother way I would describe it is that it uses Islamic things but is no more Islamic than getting a prescription for medicine from a medical doctor. The deen only demands you use your sense to the best of your ability and have sincere intentions. If you have reason to suspect anything, you have to follow your conscience. If you want to use Islamic methods that are undisputed, we all already know the basics as I mentioned above (and as Salafi critics often mention, and they're right).\n\nOne last thing, black magic can be used to generally refer to everything within the orbit of black magic but also very specifically to something that is actually and literally black magic. And black magic usually means something that is done with someone in mind or by name (sometimes using a possession of theirs, or their hair or whatever, you've probably heard of it). Most of the stuff that happens within the orbit of black magic is not like that. But those things which are like that are often extraordinarily difficult to remove or undo and part of the blame for that lies on ourselves being less religious than ever before, which is why people increasingly resort to these esoteric practices which probably were rarely needed or sought out in the old days.\n\nEven now, 'ulema resort to amals like these very rarely. Most things they just literally offer prayer for you or do the wazifa (usually simple dhikr) for you. The only difference being, they're more religious and probably believe more in what they're doing than you do, so it may seem more effective when they do it.\n\nAnd in my experience, the knowledge of these \"esoteric practices\" is also dying out. There's fewer and fewer people left who know as much or as well with each passing decade.\n\nEDIT: This definitely qualifies as gray area to avoid for many, since there is no prohibition on medicine, but there is prohibition on black magic and if you cannot distinguish between the two, then avoid it.

Something has to cause an event to happen, to weigh the scales of odds/chance in favor of it happening for it to happen (in other words, not just have the power to cause/create, but also a will to *choose* for the event to happen). So a multiverse tries to fill both holes. For one thing, now there is no nothing. There's some kind of vague matrix of universes. Where did that come from? Well, it was always there. What if you don't believe in an actually existing infinite? Well, they've taken the infinite regress out of our realm, which seems to contradict the idea of an infinite actually existing, into a fantasy/fictional realm where there's a sea of universes and it's easier for someone to fathom/accept that there may be an infinite here. An infinite sea of universes. There's no more proof for it now, it just seems an easier idea to swallow now. It's just the same old infinite regress. Moreover, this also fills the hole left by the question of choice/will. Because now you don't need a Will to \"choose\". There's no choice to make. *All* possibilities are actualized. The choice is simply taken away as an answer to the conundrum. This is not science or physics, it's philosophy and science-fiction.

If that were true, then even the Greeks, Mu'tazilah, Ash'aris, etc would have all done that. But they didn't. It is a pretty forward thinking interpretation of human knowledge because modern epistemological thinking (or at least in the last 100-200 years) informed by modern developments in science also treat the nature of human communication as a separate source, or a \"sub-source\" of knowledge. It behaves differently from reason, even if it is operating through the rational thinking of man. And yes, trusting reports is a leap in logic (or even, a leap of faith) but a necessary and human thing that all people must do. So it does make sense to treat it separately from raw rational thinking (e.g, logic).\n\nBecause Islam is not the only religion, and even the acknowledged religions (Judaism, Christianity, etc) are not the only religions and \"religious thinking\" is a real thing. Humans are hardwired for it, and plenty of things can fall under that. They also distinguish true narratives (khabar sadiq) from other kinds of narratives as well as from taqleed within discussion of that. This whole discussion on transmitted reports or narratives is *very different* from the discussion on how the human mind normally rationally operates (i.e, deductive/inductive reasoning and all that). It's like comparing sociology to psychology.\n\nIn any case it's also a very clever/convenient way of classifying knowledge because it axiomatically refutes other arguments because the proofs for Islam's supremacy when it comes to authentication of our transmitted reports (mutawatir, etc) are basically baked into the first principles. It's like defeating an opponent with just one hit, because a contest/debate was had, and it was won, but with the most simplest/quickest move possible. You have to argue *for* Islam before arguing *against* the opposition in the more traditional view. This way, the argument for Islam is almost automatic. The opponent would have to spend all their time shoring up their own creeds before even inviting you to debate/contest anything.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with that view from a religious perspective. To even assert as much is to delve headfirst into philosophy. If your view on theology is that it should be devoid of philosophy then even going there is compromising on your 'aqeedah. But islamqa.info is not a book of theology, it's just a question and answer site that is repeating answers assembled from other sources and that is a tricky endeavor so I do not blame them for what I consider an incorrect reading.\n\n&gt; This led them to force reason into fields where it has no place, so they came up with false rulings which contradicted sharee\u2019ah, and that led them to say that they did not know what the texts mean and that only Allaah knows their meaning, or to misinterpret them altogether.\n\nSounds suspiciously like a defense of anthropomorphic readings of certain verses of the Qur'an to be honest, but they're not being specific so I don't know. Where else do the actual Ahlus Sunnah, the majority of whom follow Imams Ash'ari and Maturidi, say \"only Allah knows\"?\n\nAs for what they *really* think of one another (Salafis and Deobandis), look at how they treat each other and not just at what they write about one another. If they're willing to engage in jihad with the Deobandis, to pray alongside with (or even behind) Deobandis, then clearly they don't think their 'aqeedah is that suspect. Likewise, Deobandis are usually pretty content to accept aid/funds/help from Salafis, even intermarry, etc. So I'm personally not invested in becoming an internet debate warrior over two schools who only seem to pretend to not get along on paper. Besides, Salafis are going through some schisms at the moment and have their hands full because of political events in the Arab world. I don't think they are concerned about Deobandis anymore, or if they ever really were.", "edited": 1647984330.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a word on the islamqa.info page:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is in addition to their bid\u2019ah (innovation) of dividing the sources of religion into rational matters vs. transmitted reports, which was based on the false notion of the philosophers who assumed that the religious texts contradict reason, so they tried to mediate between reason and the transmitted reports&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not why they treat transmitted reports separately from reason in their epistemology. If that were true, then even the Greeks, Mu&amp;#39;tazilah, Ash&amp;#39;aris, etc would have all done that. But they didn&amp;#39;t. It is a pretty forward thinking interpretation of human knowledge because modern epistemological thinking (or at least in the last 100-200 years) informed by modern developments in science also treat the nature of human communication as a separate source, or a &amp;quot;sub-source&amp;quot; of knowledge. It behaves differently from reason, even if it is operating through the rational thinking of man. And yes, trusting reports is a leap in logic (or even, a leap of faith) but a necessary and human thing that all people must do. So it does make sense to treat it separately from raw rational thinking (e.g, logic).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because Islam is not the only religion, and even the acknowledged religions (Judaism, Christianity, etc) are not the only religions and &amp;quot;religious thinking&amp;quot; is a real thing. Humans are hardwired for it, and plenty of things can fall under that. They also distinguish true narratives (khabar sadiq) from other kinds of narratives as well as from taqleed within discussion of that. This whole discussion on transmitted reports or narratives is &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; from the discussion on how the human mind normally rationally operates (i.e, deductive/inductive reasoning and all that). It&amp;#39;s like comparing sociology to psychology.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any case it&amp;#39;s also a very clever/convenient way of classifying knowledge because it axiomatically refutes other arguments because the proofs for Islam&amp;#39;s supremacy when it comes to authentication of our transmitted reports (mutawatir, etc) are basically baked into the first principles. It&amp;#39;s like defeating an opponent with just one hit, because a contest/debate was had, and it was won, but with the most simplest/quickest move possible. You have to argue &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; Islam before arguing &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; the opposition in the more traditional view. This way, the argument for Islam is almost automatic. The opponent would have to spend all their time shoring up their own creeds before even inviting you to debate/contest anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with that view from a religious perspective. To even assert as much is to delve headfirst into philosophy. If your view on theology is that it should be devoid of philosophy then even going there is compromising on your &amp;#39;aqeedah. But islamqa.info is not a book of theology, it&amp;#39;s just a question and answer site that is repeating answers assembled from other sources and that is a tricky endeavor so I do not blame them for what I consider an incorrect reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This led them to force reason into fields where it has no place, so they came up with false rulings which contradicted sharee\u2019ah, and that led them to say that they did not know what the texts mean and that only Allaah knows their meaning, or to misinterpret them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds suspiciously like a defense of anthropomorphic readings of certain verses of the Qur&amp;#39;an to be honest, but they&amp;#39;re not being specific so I don&amp;#39;t know. Where else do the actual Ahlus Sunnah, the majority of whom follow Imams Ash&amp;#39;ari and Maturidi, say &amp;quot;only Allah knows&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for what they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; think of one another (Salafis and Deobandis), look at how they treat each other and not just at what they write about one another. If they&amp;#39;re willing to engage in jihad with the Deobandis, to pray alongside with (or even behind) Deobandis, then clearly they don&amp;#39;t think their &amp;#39;aqeedah is that suspect. Likewise, Deobandis are usually pretty content to accept aid/funds/help from Salafis, even intermarry, etc. So I&amp;#39;m personally not invested in becoming an internet debate warrior over two schools who only seem to pretend to not get along on paper.
