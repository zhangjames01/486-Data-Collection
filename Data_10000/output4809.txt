Even printed, congratulatory letters, to the Eastern European leaders, expressing the USSR's great apreciation for their victory, in their respective sectors of the European war-theatre.\n\nThe initiation of theese plans where always thought to be a, genuine, Western provocation. It is important to remember how the two sides entered the Cold War. USA entered victorius and with the A-bomb, while the USSR entered devastated and with a very real paranoia, that the Western powers would turn on the USSR at any given moment. British plans to use German POWs against the USSR where later revealed, and during the time of American, atomic hegemony, a nuclear-backed invasion was discussed among the military leadership of the USA. The Soviet anexation of Eastern Europe, as well as their paranioa-filled military planning, has to be seen in this light.   \n\nAn asymetric measure of force, compared to what NATO was planning, was evident in the plans of the USSR. If a conflict erupted, NATO planned to fire a nuclear warning shot over the Atlantic, hopefully followed by negosiations. \nWhere as the USSR planned to nuke the Danish town of Esbjerg, followed by a full occupation of Western Europe, Yugoslavia and Sweden excluded, as their warning shot. Theese shots would have been fired two to three days into a conventional conflict on the European continent.  \nBoth the USA and the USSR knew that an invasion of Europe was a conflict senario that might have escalated into an all out nuclear war, but didn't have to. The USSR planned on using tactical nukes on every Western European port during an invasion. In such a senario, the USA was considered, even by it's NATO allies, to be most likely to abandon Western Europe all togheter. That was one of the greatest driving factors behind Frances' and the UKs' acquisition of their own nuclear devices.\n\nEveryone expected the Atlantic sea to be a barier that would weight stronger than NATO. If no nukes crossed it, World War III would have been short. The USA, accepting the loss of Western Europe. There where no such buffer-zone between the Eastern European SSR's and Russia. Had anyone provoced the territorial integrity of the USSR as a whole, the whole of Europe, excluding Sweden and Yugoslavia (possibly Albania to?) would have become SSRs.\n\nMy sources are primarily a lecture by a former Danish general, who was in service during the eighties and early nineties.

Even printed, congratulatory letters, to the Eastern European leaders, expressing the USSR&amp;#39;s great apreciation for their victory, in their respective sectors of the European war-theatre.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The initiation of theese plans where always thought to be a, genuine, Western provocation. It is important to remember how the two sides entered the Cold War. USA entered victorius and with the A-bomb, while the USSR entered devastated and with a very real paranoia, that the Western powers would turn on the USSR at any given moment. British plans to use German POWs against the USSR where later revealed, and during the time of American, atomic hegemony, a nuclear-backed invasion was discussed among the military leadership of the USA. The Soviet anexation of Eastern Europe, as well as their paranioa-filled military planning, has to be seen in this light.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An asymetric measure of force, compared to what NATO was planning, was evident in the plans of the USSR. If a conflict erupted, NATO planned to fire a nuclear warning shot over the Atlantic, hopefully followed by negosiations. \nWhere as the USSR planned to nuke the Danish town of Esbjerg, followed by a full occupation of Western Europe, Yugoslavia and Sweden excluded, as their warning shot. Theese shots would have been fired two to three days into a conventional conflict on the European continent.&lt;br/&gt;\nBoth the USA and the USSR knew that an invasion of Europe was a conflict senario that might have escalated into an all out nuclear war, but didn&amp;#39;t have to. The USSR planned on using tactical nukes on every Western European port during an invasion. In such a senario, the USA was considered, even by it&amp;#39;s NATO allies, to be most likely to abandon Western Europe all togheter. That was one of the greatest driving factors behind Frances&amp;#39; and the UKs&amp;#39; acquisition of their own nuclear devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone expected the Atlantic sea to be a barier that would weight stronger than NATO.
