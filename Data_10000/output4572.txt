Don't create an entire world right off the bat. It's easier to create a town and some surrounding areas and then continue creating as your players explore. You can add some basic notes about what else is out there to flesh out conversations, but leave details sparse until they get closer to said locations.\n\n2. Consider where your town is located, what resources are available, how old the town is, what is the population, etc. This will all help guide you in filling out what exists in your town. For example a town near the sea will likely have amenities for sailors, probably a market place where the sailors can resupply or sell their wares, a shipwright, etc.\n\n3. You don't have to name everyone if it gets hard to keep track of names. A common tactic is to pull a list of names and assign them as you go. That way you don't have to name the blacksmith if your players never visit them.\n\n4. Don't be afraid of taking an existing adventure and forcing it into your setting.\n\n5. **STEAL, STEAL, STEAL** from other sources. You'll be amazed with how much content theft you can get away with and how easy it is to mold other works into yours. For example: *An evil wizard steals the life force of powerful warriors to unleash a world destroying terror created by his deceased father* - which is straight out from dragon ball's buu saga, but if you don't mention that you can easily drop it into a D&amp;D setting.\n\n6. Have the world react to your players, but don't actively harm their fun. Basically saying \"Dwarves are a rare sight in these parts of the world\" = fun, but \"People will actively try to kill you because you are a Dwarf\" = not fun.\n\n7. If you want your world to be more unique then you should explore non-eurocentric fantasies. For example you can have a setting based in an alternate India.
