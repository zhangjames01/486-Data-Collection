This is basically welfare, whether you voluntarily assist them, or they have to acquire it through other means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, when your top gets too much money, the economy slows as that money only travels through the limited channels those few wealthy individuals choose to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best scenario is when everyone has a good amount of money to spend, and time to spend it.  Because everyone is a much larger group than the wealthy few, money travels through more avenues, which creates a healthy economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;free market&amp;quot; is a myth.  Every market is influenced by the very needs of survival, and by those who have the most leverage over the mechanisms needed for survival and/or success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The poorer population often takes jobs just to make ends meet, while the wealthy population pushes for policies and trends that support their retention of wealth.  This means the poorer population have very little leverage over the market (unless they can form something like a union), and the wealthy have a large amount of leverage over the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This disparity will always exist, as long as there is a real or artificial lack of the means of survival and/or success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t mean &amp;quot;take from the rich and give to the poor&amp;quot;.  The problem can be solved by any of a large number of means.  Closing all the loopholes that allow the wealthy to avoid taxes legally, and taking money out of politics, will help.  Changing to Universal Healthcare will help.  Making education and childcare cheap or free will help.  All of these solutions give the poorer population tools and means to survive, while also holding the wealthy accountable to their impact on society, and diminishing the increased leverage their bank accounts give them over our government and laws.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But these are just a few ideas, and its mostly just our imagination that limits how many solutions we can come up with to resolve these issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11kbfl6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/economy/comments/11kbfl6/50000000000000/jbbs9v9/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/11kbfl6/50000000000000/", "name": "t1_jbbs9v9", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/economy", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678227522.0, "created_utc": 1678227522.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/acr0k484q7ma1.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhpn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "$50,000,000,000,000", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "economy", "link_author": "sillychillly", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbar2ml", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "MonkeyFu", "num_comments": 486, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbaiq8a", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_521ni", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Ah.
