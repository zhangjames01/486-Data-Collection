Slaves, women, children, insane persons -- it is unlikely to the extreme that the writers of this amendment meant to allow these persons to &amp;#39;keep and bear&amp;#39; arms! So if &amp;quot;the people&amp;quot; demonstrably does NOT meal &amp;quot;all of the people&amp;quot;, what does it mean! Clearly only &amp;#39;some&amp;#39; of the people have the &amp;#39;right&amp;#39; to keep and bear arms. Does the amendment itself give any hint as to who these select persons may be?  YES it does: the members of the &amp;#39;well regulated&amp;#39; militia defending a free state! \nI&amp;#39;m not trying to troll you or f&lt;em&gt;ck with you- I truly believe based on my readings of constitutional law that the original meaning of the 2nd amendment was as I&amp;#39;ve described -- any bullsh&lt;/em&gt;t that &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; people&amp;#39; are permitted to arm themselves and shoot innocent civilians is modern judicial bullsh&lt;em&gt;t and over-reach.
