But so you know, I have been *nearly doored* twice since then, an both times I stopped and gave them shit, might have loooked threatening (not as threatening as swinging steel into my path) but I didn't punch them, or vandalize their vehicles.  \n\nSo what vandalism? Are you talking about a bike lane that we painted as a protest? Painting lines on a street? **Which now has a bikelane** and where, sadly, my gf was not the first person killed? Is that the \"vandalism\" that has your panties in a bunch? Do you know what kind of paint it was (we were greenies, what kind of paint do you think it was?) do you know if it was a long lasting paint job, or just a symbolic thing to rally people to push for more bike lanes? \n\nDo when people would do this? When people took over a lane a half block away (a lane that was killing people) and \"vandalized\" it, and turned it into a park that's still there to this day? You call it vandalism I call it activism.  Up in Mile End they did the same thing a few years ago and are being treated like heros.  It's certainly not like some little thug tagging his stupid name on windows, or breaking car windshields or a Canadiens riot.... we temporarily painted a bike lane to make people aware of the fact that it's needed. You can hate the theatre, you don't have to participate, but don't tell me you're morally and intellectually superior (while offering me your sympathies)\n\n\n&gt;To be reasonable opening your door while parked is by legal standards not an automotive related offense.\n\n\nLaws change. And it's becoming an offense in many places.\nBut yes, laws change. In fact for a few years after she died I stopped biking and was rollerblading. This was a long time ago (1995?), I actually got a job at Hour Magazine to rollerblade around and shoot pictures for them, and one day I got stopped by the cops. They showed me the law \"No skiing or skating on the streets\" which is probably from the 50's or 40's, and I showed the cops how much safer they are, how there's no braking distance, how I basically have the same precision I'd have on the ice....\n\n\nlastly i told them about my GF and made them open the door while I went back about 30m and then barreled towards the door. When I got to the door he opened it, and i pivoted away from the door, did a 180 button-hook turn and look him right in the eyes asking if this wasn't safer than a bike. He admitted it was, then gave me the ticket anyway.... The no skating on the street law has since changed ....not before I lost in court, and then got picked up by 5 squad cars with headlights blaring at 4am (they let me go, because by 1997 they were embarrassed that they just sent 10 men to arrest a rollerblader).\n\n\nit takes time sometimes but laws change.\n\n\n&gt;What you're suggesting is that a child sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked car, not running is punishable as driving without a license.\n\n\nUm, you're really extrapolating. And I said nothing about kids. There are rules against children operating vehicles. It's arguable that a child opening the drivers side door would fall into that... But is this a real issue with the dooring of cyclists? What percentage of people getting injured by driver side doors happens by children? ...What about kittens? Would I also extol violence on a kitten who doesn't look in the mirror before opening the door? Let's talk about the real situation, it's not kids in cars parked on the street (am pretty sure there are laws about leaving your kids in the car alone), it's adults opening the doors. And there are going to be a fuckton of laws about this--- they have no dooring laws in Virginia now ffs, Ontario is making a pretty serious dooring law now, apparently there are between 40 and 45 US states that have dooring laws. We have nothing here.\n\n\n&gt;Of course considering your last effort towards change was vandalism as opposed to legal or social pressure through the correct channels I\u2019m assuming this may be over your head a bit.\n\n\nYou think MY LAST EFFORT was in 1995? You have no idea what I do, who I am, or anything about me aside form one post I wrote about a very emotional issue. that KILLED MY GIRLFRIEND. None, You have no idea what or how I have spent my past 20 years making the world a safer and better place. This is not the place for it a dick measuring contest, but i have worked with high level politicians, with media, I have won awards for my efforts, and been highly active in my daily existence making this world a better place. I've dedicated more than half my life to it, have seen some successes, and have great peers. What the fuck have you done to merit such a haughty attitude? \n\n\nSo you be over my head. You go pressure the way you see fit. You take the high road, and paint me or whoever else you want with the broadest stroke possible... yes I have been reeling since 1995 and the only thing I've done about it is to help a team of activists paint a bike lane (which is now a freaking bike lane, so suck it) if that's what you think , I don't really care. I know who I am and what I've done.\n\n\nWhat, aside from reaming out some stranger online -- in a massively self righteous way-- have you done??", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First: Thanks.

This was a long time ago (1995?), I actually got a job at Hour Magazine to rollerblade around and shoot pictures for them, and one day I got stopped by the cops. They showed me the law &amp;quot;No skiing or skating on the streets&amp;quot; which is probably from the 50&amp;#39;s or 40&amp;#39;s, and I showed the cops how much safer they are, how there&amp;#39;s no braking distance, how I basically have the same precision I&amp;#39;d have on the ice....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;lastly i told them about my GF and made them open the door while I went back about 30m and then barreled towards the door. When I got to the door he opened it, and i pivoted away from the door, did a 180 button-hook turn and look him right in the eyes asking if this wasn&amp;#39;t safer than a bike. He admitted it was, then gave me the ticket anyway.... The no skating on the street law has since changed ....not before I lost in court, and then got picked up by 5 squad cars with headlights blaring at 4am (they let me go, because by 1997 they were embarrassed that they just sent 10 men to arrest a rollerblader).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;it takes time sometimes but laws change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What you&amp;#39;re suggesting is that a child sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked car, not running is punishable as driving without a license.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Um, you&amp;#39;re really extrapolating. And I said nothing about kids. There are rules against children operating vehicles. It&amp;#39;s arguable that a child opening the drivers side door would fall into that... But is this a real issue with the dooring of cyclists? What percentage of people getting injured by driver side doors happens by children? ...What about kittens? Would I also extol violence on a kitten who doesn&amp;#39;t look in the mirror before opening the door? Let&amp;#39;s talk about the real situation, it&amp;#39;s not kids in cars parked on the street (am pretty sure there are laws about leaving your kids in the car alone), it&amp;#39;s adults opening the doors. And there are going to be a fuckton of laws about this--- they have no dooring laws in Virginia now ffs, Ontario is making a pretty serious dooring law now, apparently there are between 40 and 45 US states that have dooring laws. We have nothing here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course considering your last effort towards change was vandalism as opposed to legal or social pressure through the correct channels I\u2019m assuming this may be over your head a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think MY LAST EFFORT was in 1995? You have no idea what I do, who I am, or anything about me aside form one post I wrote about a very emotional issue. that KILLED MY GIRLFRIEND. None, You have no idea what or how I have spent my past 20 years making the world a safer and better place. This is not the place for it a dick measuring contest, but i have worked with high level politicians, with media, I have won awards for my efforts, and been highly active in my daily existence making this world a better place. I&amp;#39;ve dedicated more than half my life to it, have seen some successes, and have great peers. What the fuck have you done to merit such a haughty attitude? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you be over my head. You go pressure the way you see fit. You take the high road, and paint me or whoever else you want with the broadest stroke possible... yes I have been reeling since 1995 and the only thing I&amp;#39;ve done about it is to help a team of activists paint a bike lane (which is now a freaking bike lane, so suck it) if that&amp;#39;s what you think , I don&amp;#39;t really care. I know who I am and what I&amp;#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What, aside from reaming out some stranger online -- in a massively self righteous way-- have you done??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {"gid_2": 1}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1okj9e", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/montreal/comments/1okj9e/parked_drivers_who_door_cyclists_cant_be_ticketed/ccth7cy/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1okj9e/parked_drivers_who_door_cyclists_cant_be_ticketed/", "name": "t1_ccth7cy", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/montreal", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1382000320.0, "created_utc": 1382000320.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 500, "id": "gid_2", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 100, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png", "days_of_premium": 7, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 512, "static_icon_width": 512, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Gives 100 Reddit Coins and a week of r/lounge access and ad-free browsing.", "end_date": null, "sticky_duration_seconds": null, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "static_icon_height": 512, "name": "Gold", "resized_static_icons": [{"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_16.png", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_32.png", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_48.png", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_64.png", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_128.png", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "penny_price": null, "award_type": "global", "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/gold_512.png"}], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/parked-drivers-who-door-cyclists-can-t-be-ticketed-police-say-1.2074231?cmp=rss"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnmr", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Parked drivers who 'door' cyclists can't be ticketed, police say", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 0, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "montreal", "link_author": "drukq", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cctgttf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "nothingbutthrowaways", "num_comments": 119, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cct8e11", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_c9jql", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks\n\n&gt; But what bothers me the most is why do cyclist LOVE to take the busiest road.
