Based on the sattelite view the Deerfield Beach intercoastal looks very narrow and far more developed so there are fewer areas where you can get out of the main channel and away from heavy boat traffic. If you can go out on weekdays you&amp;#39;ll have less boat traffic. Also look for days with wind below 10mph but these have been rare recently. The winds (and boat traffic) will be lowest early in the morning and increase as the sun rises and sea breeze builds. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/u/esaleme\"&gt;/u/esaleme&lt;/a&gt; suggested some spots out of the main intercoastal waterway. Those will probably have less boat traffic and boat wake to deal with. But the farther you get from the inlets the more murky and &amp;quot;gatorey&amp;quot; the water will get. Closer to the inlets, especially at high tide, you&amp;#39;ll have clear water and be able to see more underwater nature. However, you&amp;#39;ll also have stronger tidal currents in between high and low tide, more boat traffic, and generally stronger winds being closer to the coast. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based solely on satellite views I&amp;#39;d look at these spots:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchange Club Park &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alsdorf Park Public Boat Launch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harbor&amp;#39;s Edge Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boca has some nice looking areas that are less developed and wider so you can get away from traffic:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gumbo Limbo Nature Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver Palm Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanish River Park Kayak Launch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver Palm Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null,
