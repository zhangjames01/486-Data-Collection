Ie. does the pressure that lifts water to your rooftop heater, and to each of your plumbing fixtures come from outside the home?\n\nIf the pressure is coming from a municipal water service connection (I'm guessing that's the case), or even from a separate stand-alone well pump &amp; pressure tank, the pressure tank on your solar water heater is to protect your pipes from fluctuations in pressure resulting from heating the water, especially in recognition of the fact that the sun could boil the water in the solar collector.  It should be checked annually, because it's a safety device.  As others have stated, check the diaphragm by knocking on the side of the tank, which is half full of water and half of air, and checking the pressure at the access port, which is probably a schroeder valve like on a bike/car tire.  The setting is specific to your system, a good manufacturer will have listed it on the tank or in a manual, but if it's not there, call them, it's not a good thing to make guesses about.\n\nYou said the pressure starts declining, and is not sufficient to take a shower.  Can you confirm that you don't mean the temperature is declining?  Not meaning to be condescending, after all you're working in a 2nd-language, and it's important to confirm.  In a shower, there is a mixing valve for hot &amp; cold water, and typical domestic hot water temperatures don't allow for a 100% hot water shower, so I'm curious that you would have loss of pressure, more likely that the hot water pressure would decrease and you'd be left with a cold shower.\n\nIf it is indeed a loss of pressure, that implies a control valve that closes at the outlet of the water heater when the water heater temperature is below set-point.  That's possible, but pretty unusual.  I would suggest you inspect the piping leaving your water heater to head to your fixtures, does it have any electrically-wired devices tied back to the control board or to another wired device on the tank?  If yes, the valve I am speculating about likely exists and needs attention.\n\nThe reason the 12V pump seems random, is it is responding to your tank temperature.  As the tank temperature drops, the pump will energize and start circulating water through the solar collector to heat it up.  Once it is hot enough, the pump stops, avoiding overheating your water.\n\nThe dripping tubes are likely from pressure-relief valves.  The sun is trying to boil the water in the solar collector, and the pressure tank will absorb shocks from this, but after a certain point there's just too much, and if we don't give it somewhere to go we have a very scary bomb.  So we install pressure relief valves, which have a pre-set spring holding them closed, and opens when the water pressure rises above the set-point.  The reason you've been seeing consistent drip from them is you have a really good spot for collecting solar energy, and more solar energy than you need for your domestic hot water heating load.  They can get stuck open, because minerals in your water will deposit in the valve, preventing it from closing.  A steady drip is likely due to minerals holding your valve open, whereas over-pressure events will usually be big releases of water.  Usually for a system of this size they can't be cleaned, they just have to be replaced.  Find them, read the label on them, and replace them with the exact same pressure rating (psi/Bar). (Or have a plumber do it, again, it's a safety device, nothing wrong with looking to a professional if you're not confident.)\n\nOpening the system, disconnecting pipes, you can do it, but why do you want to?  Yes, you should relieve the pressure first, by closing the inlet ball valve (where the cold water is entering the solar heater system), then draining the pressure from a tap that is lower in elevation than the system.  It doesn't sound like you have plumbing experience, so do keep in mind you'll need tools and materials to reconnect the fittings you disassemble and not have them leak, and any plastic pipe and fittings that are getting as much sun exposure as you have will be very prone to breaking.  A broken plastic fitting on the solar collector could cost you a lot of money to fix.  \n\nGetting the air out of the system isn't dangerous to the equipment, but it's tricky, because air wants to rise to the high point, which is likely your solar collector, therefore you have to let it escape there.  There should actually be a fitting to relieve air at the top of your solar collector, and I have a feeling air in the solar collector may be the cause of the problem you're experiencing.  So let's discuss that:\n\nLook for a valve at the top of the collector.  We want to open it to bleed air out, but we have to be careful.  There's extremely hot water, possibly steam that will scald you behind it, and there's a small possibility that your system pressure is too low, and air will want to pull-in, making the problem worse not better.  So wear gloves suitable for steam, and stand where the steam won't scald you if there is steam.  You want to open the valve a tiny bit.  It will be stiff, and if you start to get a sense you're going to break it, don't force it, because again it could be a costly part to replace.  You're hoping to hear air being pushed-out.  If air is being sucked-in, close it immediately, and get help from a plumber.  If air is pushing out, allow it to push out until eventually it's all out, and water comes out.\n\nThis was fun, I hope my post is helpful to you, and my english is not too technical for your use.
