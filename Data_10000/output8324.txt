When you're working with precision sensing it's really, really beneficial to have dedicated GND and power plane layers. I know you said you want to do 2 layer (for cost I take it) but you'll have cleaner signals if your power delivery and ground return paths are solid planes. I notice there are a lot of places where GND has to neck down really small to move around the board, which isn't great for your return paths on a precision device. Seriously consider a 4 layer board.\n2. There are poorly connected fingers of GND copper between IN7P and IN6N, IN5P and IN4N, IN3P and IN2N. These do more harm than good in terms of isolating/shielding when they don't have a short, solid GND connection. Consider removing them.\n3. I'm not sure what your SCLK frequency is but it is best practice to route SPI lines as 50 ohm single ended. Necessary? Probably not, but it is best practice.\n4. There's a decent amount of capacitance on your power rails at various points so this may power on rather slowly. You said you're powering this from an rPi 5V pin? Make sure and add up all your max current draws for every chip (max draw = worst case scenario) to make sure you won't overcurrent wherever your power is coming from.\n5. Use batteries or a medical power supply of some kind like another commenter said. Please don't wire a human body up to non-isolated wall power.\n6. It appears you're using some sort of differential sensing probes? I'm not familiar with EEG sensors but I will say, while you probably don't need differential impedance control it's still beneficial to route your P/N lines as if they were diff pairs and get the P/N lengths the same so that you aren't getting slightly different IR drops on each trace. It sounds like precision here is key and you have plenty of board space, so might as well.\n7. The best place for a clock is the same layer as the device receiving the clock, as close to the clock input pin as possible. Keep the clock trace short and away from other signals. Don't run any other traces under it or near it and make sure the GND pin has a good solid connection.\n8. It wouldn't hurt to put a 0.1uF decoupling cap on the clock's VDD pin.\n9. Why are there 2 caps on the output of the clock? Wouldn't this create a sort of low pass filter and mess up your clock signal? I didn't see anything about required load cap in the clock's datasheet.\n10. Don't forget your pullup/pulldown resistors on the ADC's nCS, nRESET, and nPWDN pins if any of them need one for your application. Even if there's an internal pullup/down it's better to throw an external 10K on there just in case.\n11. You might consider separating your AGND from your DGND. It'll help your signal integrity to some degree, though it might not be possible to do with 2 layers.\n\nI referred to TI's eval board design for that ADC to check your design against: [https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau443b/slau443b.pdf?ts=1661811118753&amp;ref\\_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Ftool%252FADS1299EEGFE-PDK](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau443b/slau443b.pdf?ts=1661811118753&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Ftool%252FADS1299EEGFE-PDK)\n\nEval board designs are always a great starting point to help get an idea of the required periphreals and passives for any more complex IC.\n\nSource: professional EE &amp; PCB designer", "edited": 1661812072.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking over this really quickly on my break so bear with me if I missed some design intent or I&amp;#39;m misinterpreting anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;#39;re working with precision sensing it&amp;#39;s really, really beneficial to have dedicated GND and power plane layers.
