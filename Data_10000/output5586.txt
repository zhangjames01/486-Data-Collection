Imitation is an excellent learning technique.

For instance, how do they represent the coasts? Or the boundaries between states, or how do they model terrain?  What kind of colors are they using, and what do they represent?  Do they use subtle gradients that give emphasis to some shapes above others?  The more maps you study, I think you'll see that it's often the small things that make a map great.  \n\nDiving into maps made by experts can be intimidating though, and make sure not to wholesale copy; remember, unity is important.  All things should look like they belong together.  A good technique used to avoid confusing clutter is to treat everything in your map like a finite resource, allocating them only for necessity.  Color is beautiful but the human eye can only deal with a few hues at a time.  Likewise, patterns and lines can add clarity to your map but they can also make a page utterly incomprehensible (the spaghetti on a page effect).  \n\nLooking back at the color map you made, I can offer some critique that I feel will turn your map into something sexy.  The landforms you have imagined are terrific, but if you could balance your color choice (specifically in value and saturation) then you could immediately impress upon your audience the awesomeness you have created.  A primary issue cartographers deal with is the figure/ground effect, that is, the audience's tendency to see some things as \"in front\" of the rest.  This depth is normally achieved through use of color and position.  By centering over and zooming in on an area (i.e. making it as large as possible on the page) you accomplish much of the effect.  The rest is achieved through balancing color resources in accordance with your intent.  \n\nIf we use the HSV model, color is composed of three resources:\nHue - the principle color itself (e.g. blue, pink, green, etc)\nSaturation - the degree of hue richness (i.e. is it a pale grey-green or a vibrant neon-lime)\nValue - the brightness of the color (deep blood red or fire-engine red)\n\nSorry to have gone and written a chapter, but essentially you want to distribute the resources of value and saturation between figure and ground elements in order to both visually separate the elements, and to create a viewing hierarchy.  On your color map I think that you could desaturate the blue water so it's not so high-keyed.  I would also think of what you are trying to say by varying the greens in your land form.  They look to be two different hues of green (true green and yellow-green) while there are two different value variations of the true green (dark forest and lime).\n\nNow, having competing hues of the same class (i.e. different greens) is generally frowned upon as it breeds friction when viewing.  Also, varying a color by value as you have done with dark forest green, implies a likeness in type but also a hierarchy of them.  If you are representing countries then I would consider using colors with the same saturation and value but with different hues (e.g light green, light orange, light brown, light pink).  If you were trying to represent vegetation then I would recommend looking into patterns or texture to do so.\n\nHere are a few good color resources:\nhttp://colorbrewer2.org/     - has some predefined color schemes \nhttp://www.pixelfor.me/crc/    - allows you to create some pretty rad and custom color ramps for basically any need\nhttp://imagecolorpicker.com/en     - a way of finding out the exact color of something in an image (good for copying nice maps or constructing a color palette around themes like 'wine' or 'medieval'.

The ideal map looks like it has just sprang forth from the ground, indeed that is what it is attempting to represent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3404qu", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/mapmaking/comments/3404qu/complete_novice_looking_for_tips_on_adding_details/cqq1p1o/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mapmaking/comments/3404qu/complete_novice_looking_for_tips_on_adding_details/", "name": "t1_cqq1p1o", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/mapmaking", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1430120578.0, "created_utc": 1430120578.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mapmaking/comments/3404qu/complete_novice_looking_for_tips_on_adding_details/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2si92", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The Island of Madagascar [2550 x 3300] OC", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "MapPorn", "link_author": "godismad", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cqlgdt7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "godismad", "num_comments": 2, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_33jdty", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_inua6", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Here is the link to the full image - http://i.imgur.com/GRe0GvV.jpg\n\nedit: I forgot to link directly to the image.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": true, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the link to the full image - &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/GRe0GvV.jpg\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/GRe0GvV.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: I forgot to link directly to the image.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_33jdty", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/MapPorn/comments/33jdty/the_island_of_madagascar_2550_x_3300_oc/cqlgdt7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/33jdty/the_island_of_madagascar_2550_x_3300_oc/", "name": "t1_cqlgdt7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/MapPorn", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1429748720.0, "created_utc": 1429748720.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://imgur.com/gallery/GRe0GvV/new"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2sfsa", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Update: I went with a fantasy style.

In fact, if any single event can be said to have been CRITICAL in &amp;#39;starting&amp;#39; the Renaissance I would say that it was the fall of the western Roman Empire nearly a thousand years before Petrarch (the first to put forth the notion of a &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; emerging from the &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; ages).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_31kjhh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskHistorians/comments/31kjhh/black_death_caused_the_european_renaissance/cq3on0s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/31kjhh/black_death_caused_the_european_renaissance/", "name": "t1_cq3on0s", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1428373352.0, "created_utc": 1428373352.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/31kjhh/black_death_caused_the_european_renaissance/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Black Death caused the European Renaissance?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskHistorians", "link_author": "Bustractor", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cq2rhnw", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "godismad", "num_comments": 5, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_31kjhh", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_inua6", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Hmm, I'm not too certain what you are looking for in terms of answers; but I would caution against broad conclusions such as this.
