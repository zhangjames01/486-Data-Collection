I guess if I brewed during a hurricane I&amp;#39;d put a brick or two on top before going inside. \ud83d\ude42&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_118ymhv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Homebrewing/comments/118ymhv/wort_chiller_hoses/j9le281/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/118ymhv/wort_chiller_hoses/", "name": "t1_j9le281", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Homebrewing", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1677098336.0, "created_utc": 1677098336.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/118ymhv/wort_chiller_hoses/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qj8u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Wort Chiller Hoses?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Homebrewing", "link_author": "collinnator5", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j9krder", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "bri-an", "num_comments": 58, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j9ked1d", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_bjdql", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "My lid has a small hole on the top (by design) to allow steam to escape, and I also don't bother with painters tape or anything.
