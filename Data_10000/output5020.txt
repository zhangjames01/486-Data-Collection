Then around 605pm (or whatever their late pickup leeway is), they asked kid's dad where he was. He probably said someone was on their way (then when he/his girlfriend couldn't come he texted you). If they've already talked to dad, who told them someone was coming, they wouldn't also call you.     \n   \nDefinitely talk to the program and ask what happened, and be sure to let them know your kid is always to be picked up at 4 and to call YOU if it's past 4 without anyone there.
