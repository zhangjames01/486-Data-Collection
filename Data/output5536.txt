Again, if you compare the capital ratios of SVB to other financial institutions and adjust these based on marked-to-market values of their holdings, &lt;em&gt;they are a significant outlier relative to their cohorts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How does a bank hedge for both the possibility that easy money will keep flowing and for the possibility that the fed will drastically go in the opposite direction?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They trade a little passive interest income by holding their capital reserves in cash or other instruments with shorter maturities; or, they make sure to allocate more of these capital reserves as \u201cavailable to sell\u201d vs. \u201chold to maturity\u201d (i.e. they give up bigger interest payments to make sure more of their portfolio is available to be liquidated at or near par).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: remember, they are not the only bank out there. JPM operates in the same macro environment and still have a solid capitalization ratio even with marked-to-marked losses in their portfolio. And while JPM isn\u2019t a peer, FRC is and their marked-to-market reserve ratios are at least 300-400 bps higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11pffw9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/news/comments/11pffw9/yellen_says_no_federal_bailout_for_silicon_valley/jbyb9mc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/11pffw9/yellen_says_no_federal_bailout_for_silicon_valley/", "name": "t1_jbyb9mc", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/news", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678643070.0, "created_utc": 1678643070.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://apnews.com/article/silicon-valley-bank-bailout-yellen-deposits-failure-94f2185742981daf337c4691bbb9ec1e?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_04"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3l", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Yellen says no federal bailout for Silicon Valley Bank", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 6, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "news", "link_author": "cgmcnama", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jby5s1s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "mauxfaux", "num_comments": 4611, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jby5jcd", "score": 6, "author_fullname": "t2_38p1x", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You are correct.
