But where that lands vs... say zaitan before power absorption (who is lackluster because he was earliest introduced ED), it's hard to say. Because they never get into a fight and there's never really any mention of them getting into a fight with one another. I would imagine balthazar, being the god of war is the strongest among the other 5 in fighting.\n\nDhuum fought with Grenth, but Grenth brought 7 reapers with him. So, despite being a challenge, wasn't exactly fair. Regardless, this is at least still sorta 1v1 unlike 5v1 with abaddon.\n\nFor dragons, because they absorb the power of the previous dead elder dragon, whoever survives could be said to be stronger. (inser: there can be only one!!! highlander.gif)\n\nWhere Kormir and Lyssa goes is also kind of questionable. If Kormir absorbed the power of the strongest ex-god, she should be strongest. But it's never mentioned. Perhaps because she's new...? Also abaddon is god of knowledge and water. Kormir became god of knowledge. And the power over water went to Lyssa.

Kormir (post-ascension)) \u2013 I\u2019m placing the human gods above the rest of the dragons because it\u2019s implied that they could defeat the elder dragons. It\u2019s just that the aftermath would be worse than not having fought at all. So the powers should be very similar, but slightly in adv for gods.\n* [Rest of Elder Dragons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elder_Dragon)\n\n**Almost God Tier**\n\n* Abaddon (post-seal) \u2013 While he had large amount of his powers sealed, he was still swallowing Elona and had power over the realm of torment. And he continued to be a threat to the gods.\n* The [Mursaat](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Mursaat) \u2013 It\u2019s a bit weird to put an entire race here while rest are more of individuals. [Lazarus](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lazarus_the_Dire) isn\u2019t particularly stronger than the other mursaat, just the only one that managed to survive the [flameseeker prophecies](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Flameseeker_Prophecies). They\u2019re the core enemy of guildwars prophecies and were going to take over the world, unless the flameseeker prophecies by Glint were to come true. They were worshiped as gods by the [white mantle](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/White_Mantle).\n* [Titans](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Titan) \u2013 They killed the mursaat, so, they should be above it. But, we killed the titans, so it\u2019s a strange rock-paper-scissors relationship here. They were worshipped by the charr Shamans. They provided the [cauldron of cataclysm](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cauldron_of_Cataclysm) to the charr, under the orders of Abaddon, which brought [the searing](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Searing).\n* [Dhuum](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dhuum) (post-fall), Grenth (pre-ascension \u2013 he was the half-god son of Dwayna)\n\n**A Tier**\n\n* [Leviathan](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leviathan) \u2013 It\u2019s uncertain if this and the \u201cdeep sea monster\u201d mentioned in the lore are the same thing. While they do seem to have somewhat finite lifespan and not an immortal being like the some others in the list, their massive size and strength seems clear. We only ever fought with adolescent leviathans in GW2 and there are some skeletal remains of the previous. It\u2019s also implied this may be our next boss in the continuation of the series. Though, hate for underwater combat might force this to never be a thing.\n* [Palawa Ignacious Joko](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Palawa_Joko) \u2013 Immortal unless consumed. Takes over most of elona with the undying race that he raises.\n* [Shiro Tagachi](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shiro_Tagachi) (Envoy) \u2013 the villain of GW Factions. He got tempted by a servant of Abaddon and became who he is. His death by [Archemorus](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Archemorus) and [Viktor](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Saint_Viktor) caused the [Jade Wind](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Jade_Wind). He only managed to get even stronger after becoming the envoy by using the envoy powers to create the [afflicted](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Afflicted).\n* [The Great Destroyer](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Great_Destroyer) \u2013 main villain of GW Eye of the North. He is a spawn of Primordus.

Her powers in prophecies is what drives the entire series from the beginning.\n* [Vizier Khilbron](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vizier_Khilbron) \u2013 A strong follower of Abaddon. Though he has caused the [Cataclysm](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Cataclysm), became the [Undead Lich](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Undead_Lich), and tried to take over flameseeker prophecies, but I\u2019m placing him this far below the list because he\u2019s a schemer. Not really a powerhouse, similar to Glint.\n\n**B Tier**\n\n* [Asgeir Dragonrender](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Asgeir_Dragonrender) - grandfather of Knut Whitebear. Said to have defeated Frostfang with a single blow. Knocked out the tooth of Jormag. And founded Hoelbrak.

Said to be strongest champion of Kralk.\n* [Frostfang](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frostfang_\\(dragon_champion\\)) - Literally said to be the strongest of the Jormag's champions. \n* [Drakkar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Drakkar) - In fairness of jormag and primordus being equal, I should place some of Jormag's champion on same spot as the great destroyer as they're one of, if not the, first champion of these dragons. Perhaps it's just because of the way story is told, but I just don't see them doing anywhere as much damage as the great destroyer did, or the story's response to their threat.\n* Tequatl the Sunless, along with Fafnarin the Heartslayer and Blightghast the Plaguebringer. All zaitan's dragon champs.\n* Pale Tree \u2013 though no specific strong power of her own. The fact that she can birth all these sylvari gotta count for something, like a queen in a beehive.\n* Trahearne \u2013 Though not the crowd favorite, he does lead the pact into killing an elder dragon.\n* Faolain \u2013 Leader of the nightmare court. Firstborn sylvari.\n* Zommoros (the magic toilet), Qadim, and other named exceptionally strong djinn.\n* Scarlet Briar \u2013 LW1 boss\n* Shadow of the Dragon \u2013 Boss of LW2, and champion of Mordremoth\n* Ryland Steelcatcher (post-Jormag) \u2013 Boss of LW5\n* Raid Bosses \u2013 I\u2019m just going to lump most of the raid bosses here. They\u2019re mostly servants of elder dragons, gods, or mursaat, so this rank seems fitting.\n* Queen Jennah \u2013 She is surprisingly strong. I\u2019m not quite sure how it makes sense that she became so strong, but she is. She single handedly ended the Ogre Revolt with a mesmer clone of Kralk and brand minions\u2014which kind of makes her the strongest mesmer we ever see. But she appears to be a strong mesmer only, as there seem to be times where she shows physical weakness like during the Closing Ceremony.\n* Livia (gw2) \u2013 She doesn\u2019t really seem to die.\n* [Svanir](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Nornbear) - aka nornbear. He is the one revered by the sons of svanir and where the name comes from. He's the first to be turned champion of Jormag. Though not particularly strong by itself, he does hold a significant story value.\n* Destiny\u2019s Edge \u2013 I\u2019m just going to put the whole crew here. Caithe, Logan Thackeray, Rytlock Brimstone, Eir Stegalkin (and Garm!), Snaff and Zojja.\n\n**C Tier**\n\n* Dragon's Watch \u2013 they just don\u2019t seem to have as much kick to them as the Destiny\u2019s Edge counter part.\n* Zaitan's many many named champions - So many like the Eye of Zaitan, but I feel like none of them are particularly worthy of mention besides the dragon ones listed in B Tier. Large part of Zaitan was that he had an extremely, ridiculously--nay, ludicrously large army. Not that individuals were super strong.\n* [GW1 \u201cHero\u201d](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Hero) \u2013 Like Koss, Ogden, Gwen, Jora, Miku, etc. except Livia. Though Livia at the time would also be in C tier.\n\n**F- Tier**\n\n* [Kormir](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kormir) (pre-ascension) \u2013 Dammit Kormir! Stop stealing my credits and godhood!\n\n**Honorary mention but can't quite place anywhere**\n\n* Aurene - She's probably *the* strongest by the end of everything. She did absorb all the ED's energy afterall. But we don't really seem to do anything with it because it makes it too easy I guess.\n* You - The pact commander. You have the power of plot armor and infinite respawns. Again, weird to place it anywhere. Arguable that individually you aren't as strong as some as you always get help to beat strong targets. But ability to gather an army is power too, same reason I placed Pale Tree, Trahearne, etc that high up.\n\nI probably missed a ton.
