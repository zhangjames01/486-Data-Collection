The post has an album of all the photos.\n\n  \nBreakfast was a short stack of griddle cakes, melted butter, maple syrup, lightly heated, slice of ham at the [Great Northern hotel](https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Great\\_Northern\\_Hotel). [Nothing beats the taste sensation when maple syrup collides with ham.](https://youtu.be/qP6ZowsV4GI) I used the opportunity to try out Mark Bittman's [everyday pancakes](https://mytherapistcooks.com/everyday-pancakes/) from NYT cooking. They were pretty good and very fluffy.\n\n  \nLunch was $6.31 at the [Lamplighter Inn](https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Lamplighter\\_Inn). That's on Highway 2 near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna fish sandwich on whole wheat, slice of cherry pie, and a cup of coffee. [Damn good food](https://youtu.be/w-h9HeIThQk). No real recipe for the tuna salad: tuna, red onions, pickles, and mayo on toasted bread. The cherry pie recipe is listed at the end.  \n\n\nStopped back at the Great Northern for snacks with Ben and Jerry Horne. I had the [best damn sandwich](https://youtu.be/N6A7VXqveC8) Jerry ever ate. A baguette with brie and butter. No real recipe other than to pop a demi baguette in the oven until toasted and let the heat melt the brie and butter. I've made this many times before and it's really tasty. I also made Jerry's [smoked cheese pig](https://imgur.com/a/hQ62kym). I used u/homicidalhomemaker 's [smoked cheeseball pig](https://youtu.be/XtAA4\\_\\_2pk0) recipe. Her website also has a [text version of the recipe](https://www.thehomicidalhomemaker.com/twin-peaks-smoked-cheese-pig/), but I loved the video too much not to post it. This far exceeded my expectations and my kids loved it. It was super cute and [stood on its own](https://imgur.com/tjSYLuE).  \n\n\nDinner was at the [\"Haywood Supper Club\"](https://youtu.be/3JMdhRspUSQ) with the Haywoods and Palmers for dinner. I served [roast beef](https://kitskitchen.com/how-to-cook-melt-in-your-mouth-roast-beef-easy-recipe/#recipe), pan gravy, [buttered carrots](https://www.thespruceeats.com/buttered-baby-carrots-482781), peas, green beans, and mashed cauliflower. I deliberately chose really bland veggie recipes because I'm pretty sure that no spices were harmed in the making of this scene. I'd never made a full roast beef before, but [the\u00a0roast was beautiful](https://imgur.com/v0zjBLI) and tasted fantastic.  \n\n\nLastly, the [Double R Diner](https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Double\\_R\\_Diner) provided cherry pie and coffee for dessert. I used the supposed [official recipe for Twin Peaks cherry pie](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/twin-peaks-cherry-pie-recipe/). NYT Cooking has an [identical recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018759-twin-peaks-cherry-pie) posted but uses American units. Cherry pie is my absolute favorite thing to eat and I'm still learning how to make it right. My favorite recipe uses an oil-based crust and this was my first time working with a butter crust. Butter crust is a fussy baby and got a little too warm. It was a little more crispy than flaky but was overall okay. If you want the real Twin Peaks pie, head over to [Twede's Cafe](https://www.twedescafe.com/) in North Bend, Washington where filming took place.\n\n  \nThis is one of my favorite weeks ever on r/52weekofcooking.
