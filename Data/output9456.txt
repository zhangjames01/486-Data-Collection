That kind of post belongs immediately after the race, when everyone is excited by Williams being back and wants to talk about it.  If you wanted to post that after the race it would have to be *\"Can we take a moment to celebrate something?\"*. It wouldn't be able to mention \"return, greatest F1 teams, top step of the podium, 8 years, Williams\" or \"back\".

To most people that's a spoiler, as there are only a few possible reasons for a post race grid penalty, the most obvious one being that he was the cause of a crash.
