Even Southern Baptist followers believe Pentecostals are crazy!  These people have some OLD SCHOOL beliefs.  Women are not allowed to run the house, they cook and clean and make babies.  No birth control at all.  Women cannot cut their hair or wear pants because it, \"means they're taking on the likeness of a man\" and cannot wear makeup because \"you cannot taint or cover up the perfection that God created in your face.\" Very culty shit.  Don't even get me started on the men of the church.  They make Trump look like he's on the left, politically speaking. \n\nThe biggest thing about them is that people will \"get the holy ghost\" and start speaking in tongues, puke exorcist style, and the rest of  the congregation has to pray it out of said person.  Most of their churches have buckets on each aisle to prevent them from puking on the floor.  I went to one service as a child and have had nightmares ever since.  There was a little old lady recovering from a hip replacement \"catch the holy ghost\" and she started screaming and doing cartwheels down the aisle. Needless to say I got the hell out of there FAST.  If your MIL takes your kids to church, they WILL see something like that.  It happens pretty much every week.\n\nAnything that is not the form of a white male Jesus who believes that women are subservient, men are on top, and the only poor people are those who sit in the back you don't talk to is not ok in my book.  And it is unfortunately the basis of the Pentecostal religion, but doesn't even hold a candle to their actual beliefs.\n\nIf you were to actually skip church for one reason or another that isn't a life or death situation, or previously approved by the preacher, then they turn on you. Plus, its like a cult.  People who are all in on the Pentecostal religion need church like a drug.  Morning and nightly sermons on Sunday, Wednesday night sermon as well, and lets not forget the gossip hour before each.  This is one of those churches that can and will get the entire congregation to show up to your house to have an \"intervention\" and force you to come back.  I've seen it happen, and it wasn't pretty.\n\nThere were a lot of people correctly speaking when saying that these people are the insane end of religion, and are dead set on converting anyone.  It is God's way (AKA: their way) or hell.  And unfortunately, I've never met a mother or father in that religion that was a Just Yes.  If anything, your MIL is on the mild spectrum, because she didn't completely cut her son out of her life when he didn't marry a Pentecostal woman.  Yes, that's happened in my hometown.  Yes, it was the MIL's fault.  \n\nI cannot tell you HOW to talk to your MIL, but I did want you to know that its going to be a fight and the outcome will probably be a very pissed off MIL.  This is also something you cannot back down on or even give an inch, or else it won't be just your MIL stepping over you.  It will be the entire church, because they want to convert your entire family, once they have your kids converted.  \n\nI also wouldn't let her alone in your house, or else she WILL throw away anything that she believes is \"evil spirits\" or will plant crucifixes or bibles/biblical sayings around your house \"to protect you\" or something.  Continue to watch her like a hawk, because she proved that she will not respect your beliefs with the magnets.  My cousin's wife would babysit one of my friend's kids and they would have to search the diaper bag before they left because cousin's wife would either put a bible, biblical saying, or religious figurine in there to \"protect the baby from being pulled from the righteous path of God by her heathen mother\" as she would say.  Cousin's wife was the only daycare around, or else friend would have taken the baby out so fast it's head would spin.\n\nYou definitely have a lot of great advice from people here.  But please tread carefully, and don't expect rational rebuttals or artuments.  These people are psychotic and wouldn't know a boundary if it hit them in the face screaming.  Good luck, and protect your kids momma bear!  You've got this!\n\nSorry for the giant wall of text.  This religion is just one of the big reasons I had to leave town once I graduated high school.  I couldn't take their prejudice and crazy anymore. I knew not all people were good.
