The point I was making is that having the bag freed me from a lot of the pain and restrictions of my illness. Also if your doctors are recommending it, then it prob is for the best. I have lost 4/5 years having surgeries and trying medications to try get rid of the bag, I suppose this is why they don't recommend pouch surgery for most crohn's patients!\n\nNow onto your questions..\n\n*I had to empty the bag about 5 or 6 times a day, probably comparable to how often you need to piss. The colon absorbs moisture and slows the transit of your crap so when you lose it things are a bit more loose and more frequent (than a healthy person, it could be an improvement from your current state). I've had a few different stomas- the 1st one was an end ileostomy where they remove the colon and pop the last bit of the ileum (small intestine) out your abdomen. This one was the least active for me and I only had to change the bag every 2-3 days before the skin got irritated. After this i've had a few different loop ileostomys once my pouch was formed, which is taken from higher up in the small intestine. These ones I had to empty about the same as before but found I had to change the bag daily to avoid skin irritation round the stoma. This is because the waste is less processed and more acidic higher up in the gut. Depending on how much of your colon they remove you will prob be more like my 1st stoma, or maybe even better than that.\n\n* I got used to it quite fast. When I had my surgery there wasn't really many options as I was really ill and wasting away so there was no real time to mull it over. You will be surprised at how quickly you adapt to a new toilet/showering routine. It just became the new norm. It still is weird sometimes to look down and see this bag stuck to your stomach but think of it as a good thing - the thing that gave you your life back.\n\n* On the sleeping, I usually had to get up during the night to empty and my body got very well adapted to waking me up when I needed to. Not gonna lie either, I had a few leaks when I slept on longer than I should but you just gotta deal with them. Before the bag and now I have the pouch I have to get up at night anyway so it's not that much different. I'm not sure what your crohn's symptoms are or how often you go at the minute so it's hard to compare.\nAs for love life, I didn't have a girlfriend at the time of surgery and because having the bag for me was only meant to be temporary I kind of shut myself off from the possibility of romance until I had it reversed. I did have a few not-quite-girlfriends in this time and they were fine with it, it really was just me feeling unconfident about exposing myself. Now that I know after this surgery I will have the bag for life I will be much more open about it to girls and if they don't like it, then they are not worth it anyway. Because you are already on a relationship and your girlfriend can be there for you every step of the way it will prob make you much stronger as a couple.\n\n* I've always worn kinda baggy clothes/hoodies and stuff. Tight fitting plain coloured t-shirts were out for me, I tended to go for more patterend t-shirts in the summer so that if some creases appear where it shows the outline of the bag then it can be hidden by the pattern. It will be something you are aware of but not a lot of others will be. I have some really good friends who never knew I had the bag until I told them recently and they were shocked that they never saw or suspected anything different in me.\n\nAs for your mental battle, just stay positive. Having a bag for me was definitely better than having a badly performing colon, and a bad pouch for that matter. Regarding the surgery, you will be really sore but the way i've dealt with it in the past is just not even think about it until you wake up post-op. Take whatever pain meds you can get and get on with it. I find it almost like a cathartic experience, once you come through it you'll know what really matters in life and all the rest will just seem trivial.\n\nAny more questions, ask away..\n\nAll the best.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey no probs Bryyce, just re-read my last post and hope it doesn&amp;#39;t come across too doom and gloom.
