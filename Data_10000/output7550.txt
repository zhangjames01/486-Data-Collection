However, you want to keep your puppy safe from parvovirus and distemper, so make sure that you check with your vet to get on an appropriate vaccine schedule.

From 3-6 months, they should not be left longer than their age in months (for example, 3-month-old puppies cannot be alone for longer than 3 hours).

Being confined to one room can lead to separation anxiety when you leave if you aren't careful, and that can lead to excessive barking. Start with short periods of separation (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase your absences to show your dog that you will come back. To avoid the puppy getting bored and destructive, get lots of interactive toys. Crate training is also an option, but lacks the social and environmental stimulation. \n\n**In Short...**\n\nI don't want to be a downer, but I think a puppy is a less than ideal choice for a first pet. They need a lot of time and energy, similar to having a baby or a toddler. You being in uni adds to the difficulty.

Did you see the puppy's parents in person? Did you see where the dogs are bred and housed? Is there paperwork, vet records, etc. to verify the actual age of the puppy? Many people buy a puppy sight-unseen via email/text and upon delivery discover the dog is much younger than the breeder stated. Is there any kind of health guarantee? Did the puppies have a wellness visit after birth to check for birth defects or genetic abnormalities? Is there a reason you went with this breeder rather than a shelter or breed-specific rescue?\n2. Do you have money for vet bills? If your puppy picks up parvovirus and spends days or more in the veterinary hospital, do you have emergency funds for such an expense? Can you afford pet insurance now, before your puppy develops a pre-existing condition that may  not be covered by insurance in the future? \n3. Do you understand that a puppy is a huge commitment of time and energy? Puppies may not chill out for \\*years\\*. Puppies destroy things, puppies have accidents in the house, puppies bark. If your lifestyle and living arrangement make this undesirable, please reconsider. \n4. Are apartments in your area typically pet-friendly? Many places do not allow dogs, so consider that you may have fewer options for accommodations if you have a dog.
