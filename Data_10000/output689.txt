He dies, and you realize that you spent the first half of your life living for someone who's not even around to appreciate the effort you put in.\n\nTL;DR: Be your own person. You are worthwhile. \n\nAlso, I have my learner's permit and I'm 25. I fucked my life up pretty bad, but in the last few years, I've been a manager at two companies.

Neither does anybody else. The beauty of this life is that we're all equally insignificant. I mean, I don't even remember the *names* of my great grandparents, let alone what they looked like, what they did, what kind of legacy they left behind. So where does that leave us? Right here, right now. You don't have to build a fucking pyramid, just make it through today without blowing your head off.\n\nYou are very good at communicating your thoughts, something that becomes a necessity when living with a mood disorder, unless you want to spend the rest of your life in a psych ward. But you know, even that isn't so bad. They feed you, exercise you, try to give you some semblance of normalcy.\n\nNobody know the perfect way to live. Everyone, from the richest person in the world to the people trying to scrape together enough heroin to not shit their pants, is just doing the best they can, figuring it out as they go, or using someone else's idea of how life should be. \n\nYou don't have to save the world. You don't even have to save yourself. You don't *have* to do anything. You are free to do anything within the laws of physics. If that's going to the middle east, go for it. If that's becoming a doctor, go for it. If that's masturbating 4 times a day, go for it. Nobody is the boss of you but *you*. \n\nIf you're tired, quit doing the bullshit to just keep up appearances. Stop doing the things that other people expect you to do. Why should their expectations matter more than yours? As long as you aren't infringing on anyone else's freedom, I think you should be able to do whatever you want.\n\nI find that as far as drugs go, benzos, opiates/oids, weed and booze all have a tendency to make me satisfied with my current situation regardless of whether or not said situation is actually one that sober me would be satisfied with. This is useful for \"breaks\", days where I lower expectations of myself. It is not useful for every day use, as I end up not cleaning, not giving a fuck about anything, and not trying to change things.\n\nPsychedelics, dissociatives, and stimulants tend to give me a little more motivation to change my situation. I like to write down my ideas, then work on them sober.

Neither does anybody else. The beauty of this life is that we&amp;#39;re all equally insignificant. I mean, I don&amp;#39;t even remember the &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt; of my great grandparents, let alone what they looked like, what they did, what kind of legacy they left behind. So where does that leave us? Right here, right now. You don&amp;#39;t have to build a fucking pyramid, just make it through today without blowing your head off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are very good at communicating your thoughts, something that becomes a necessity when living with a mood disorder, unless you want to spend the rest of your life in a psych ward. But you know, even that isn&amp;#39;t so bad. They feed you, exercise you, try to give you some semblance of normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nobody know the perfect way to live. Everyone, from the richest person in the world to the people trying to scrape together enough heroin to not shit their pants, is just doing the best they can, figuring it out as they go, or using someone else&amp;#39;s idea of how life should be. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to save the world. You don&amp;#39;t even have to save yourself. You don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do anything. You are free to do anything within the laws of physics. If that&amp;#39;s going to the middle east, go for it. If that&amp;#39;s becoming a doctor, go for it. If that&amp;#39;s masturbating 4 times a day, go for it. Nobody is the boss of you but &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re tired, quit doing the bullshit to just keep up appearances. Stop doing the things that other people expect you to do. Why should their expectations matter more than yours?

Here are my thoughts:\n\n**TL;DR: do what you gotta do, man**\n\nRunning out of venlafaxine is potentially lethal for me, even for a couple days. I just made a post about ordering anti-d's online, and I'll update once I get more info about where the best/cheapest places to get them are once I find out. I also have dropped a great deal of my savings on meds/therapy, and I'd like to cut down on that. Having money is a great stress reliever. \n\nAs far as booze goes, or any GABAergic depressant, the key to quitting is to taper off. Immediate cessation can cause seizures, and that's a pretty shitty time, I'm told.\n\nI only drank daily for a period of a couple months in high school. After I moved out, I went from cannabis to dextromethorphan to a plethora of other drugs. You're right, it is very dangerous. I don't recommend it, particularly in cases of schizophrenia, but it is less dangerous than suicide.\n\nDo what you have to do in order to survive. It may not be glamorous, it may not be socially acceptable, but every day you manage to not kill yourself is a success. I try to look at the kind of life I'd actually want to live, find the differences between that ideal and my current life, and then see what I can do about making it a reality.\n\nIf your grades are shitty, so what? Maybe it will take you an \"extra\" year to finish, or maybe you don't finish at all. That is okay. You don't have to feel guilty about feeling shitty, or you'll just feel shittier. Guilt, shame, embarrassment, all these \"negative\" emotions are just motivators to change our situations, to right our wrongs. But in mood disorders, we experience these emotions to an exaggerated degree. We easily become so overwhelmed by the emotions that we must blindly reach for anything that will give us a bit of breathing room.\n\nWe cannot control our emotions, but we can look at their causes, and their purpose. We can control how we logically react to illogical impulses. We don't have to be perfect. If you need a drink, you need a drink. Before you slam it back, though, think about why. Do you feel shitty? What is the cause of this feeling? Is is how other people treat you? How you treat yourself? Is it just a bad day?\n\nI try to use drugs as a constructive tool to help me get past the worst of it and reframe my thoughts in such a way that once I'm sober, I'll be able to at least *try* something new. I don't put any pressure on myself to figure out my life, just to keep changing selected parts of it until they don't suck so much.\n\nSchool made me feel like garbage. Because I'm actually not an idiot, but I kept wasting my potential. But you know, I also have the potential to injure myself or others, and I haven't tried to do that in quite some time. I gave up formal education because it makes me want to kill myself. It doesn't make sense, and I'm still working on figuring that one out, but in the meantime, I had to remove myself from that situation lest it overwhelm me.\n\nI function a little \"lower\" than most people. I haven't left my apartment in two days, I don't have job, and the NEET life is getting old. *BUT* I am still here, I was able to hold down a job long enough to save 10 grand, I'm out of my parents' basement, and I don't even have to use recreational drugs on a daily basis in order to postpone my inevitable doom.\n\nDealing with depression isn't just getting your life on track, it is learning to accept that you will get \"off track\". No matter. Try to get back on. If you fail, so what? Nobody knows the Right, True and Best Way to Live Your Life ^TM , we just do the best we can, or borrow someone else's idea. Maybe the best you can do is completing your education. Maybe the best you can do is staying alive while you get failing grades. This may not fit into your idea of the Right, True and Best Way to Live Your Life ^TM , but ideas are malleable. And looking at it logically, a degree means nothing if you're dead.\n\nBest of luck, internet pal.
