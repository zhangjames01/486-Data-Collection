I found out that this dosage form has apparently been backordered with no supply received for over a month now at both my home store &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; at a different local chain that is supplied by a completely different wholesaler (they actually can&amp;#39;t get their hands on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the different generics normally available to them &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; even on the &lt;em&gt;brand name&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, my regular location had some generic 10 mg Adderall IR in stock, and after checking with them to confirm they actually had enough to fill my full RX and would be okay with me wiping out a quarter of a stock bottle in one go, I had my provider cancel the scripts on file and replace them with scripts for 2x 10 mg per dose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My insurer only paid for 1/4 of the total dispensed instead of the usual 3/4 because of their annoyingly-miserly quantity limits. As a result I ended up paying roughly $100 total out of pocket instead of the usual ~$26 total OOP (in both cases after running the non-covered portion through a savings card for access to PBM discounts). But at least I was able to get another month of meds without further undue delays, and it was still &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; cheaper than paying $600\u2013$900 for the (potentially not even available) brand name either...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m already dreading next month though, as the stock situation has just been getting worse and worse every month and the outlook for when production might start catching back up with demand keeps getting grimmer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10u0u6y", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/10u0u6y/i_just_googled_adderall_shortage_and_got_a/j7dueu7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/10u0u6y/i_just_googled_adderall_shortage_and_got_a/", "name": "t1_j7dueu7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "author_flair_text": "ADHD-PI", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675647713.0, "created_utc": 1675647713.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/10u0u6y/i_just_googled_adderall_shortage_and_got_a/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I just googled adderall shortage and got a sponsored ad from Done (who contributed to the shortage) promoting how they can help with the adderall shortage \ud83d\ude44", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ADHD", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7dqwmx", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "mesalocar", "num_comments": 260, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7dlsxw", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_cdr98", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "FYI it's the DEA that sets, manages, and controls the production quotas, not the FDA.

Some pharmacists may not give a shit, so it&amp;#39;s not foolproof, but many pharmacists would be quite willing to lay into your parents over this, which enforces the message quite well. If you go to the doctor, they should react similarly, but there is a chance that your doctor may not react appropriately to this. Unfortunately this is a risk in general with doctors (and less so but still present with psychiatrists) due to flaws with training and specialization, and your odds are worsened by your doctor&amp;#39;s relationship with your family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If after all this they continue their behavior, you&amp;#39;re likely going to need to involve the authorities. &lt;em&gt;Keep in mind that if your parents decide to take you off your prescription entirely (meaning you stop the meds entirely and no more RXs are filled), you are pretty much screwed.&lt;/em&gt; So this could backfire if that happens. But if it doesn&amp;#39;t, well, you can try your luck with child protection services. If they&amp;#39;re taking or selling the pills, you need to seriously consider getting the police involved, because CPS can&amp;#39;t do much at this point. Yes, it can get nasty, but it may be the best thing to do, especially if they&amp;#39;re taking the pills.

I&amp;#39;ve seen numerous examples of back-to-back patients being the reason for late appointments at the campus clinics, and I&amp;#39;m not surprised that a private practitioner would prefer to just completely refuse to screw up things like that if you&amp;#39;re late. It&amp;#39;s worth considering how things look from the doctor&amp;#39;s perspective before jumping to conclusions about anything. (but of course you should know as a therapist how that is -- I know you say you take clients late, but well, it&amp;#39;s different in therapy, wider windows is one big difference, but there&amp;#39;s lots, and it can always come down to what they prefer for their practice, and how they view delaying other patients or compromising an already-rushed appointment to shorten it to fit)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3ez7gw", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/3ez7gw/psych_offices_suck/ctk78ts/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3ez7gw/psych_offices_suck/", "name": "t1_ctk78ts", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ADHD", "author_flair_text": "ADHD-PI", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1438175551.0, "created_utc": 1438175551.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3ez7gw/psych_offices_suck/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Denied Visits with child due to my adderall", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ADHD", "link_author": "Onestoptekshop", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ctik2k9", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "mesalocar", "num_comments": 16, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cti6i0v", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_cdr98", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/7/563.abstract\n\nTl;dr: Your levels actually make sense if this is the technique used, you appear to be loosely similar to subject 1 in that trial in terms of serum levels if you convert the dose, so the increased serum levels vs \"normal\" aren't of concern.
