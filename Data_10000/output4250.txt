The most it\u2019s ever offset from my e max bill was about $50, and that\u2019s because it was a particularly sunny July and we were barely home so we used very little electricity. When people ask me about it I emphatically say it\u2019s not an investment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, what I like about doing it now is that the infrastructure like wiring and stuff gets done now, and in the future when there is better tech you can swap out the panels and inverters a fairly easily. I have 11 panels, and if the tech evolves to the point where I can fit 11 1,000W panels then it\u2019ll be in good shape in terms of returns. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ROI for me is 25+ years at current production and the cost of electricity, and all that is variable so an ROI estimate is more like an educated guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_113c8r7", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Calgary/comments/113c8r7/skyfire_energy_for_solar/j8poa0h/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/113c8r7/skyfire_energy_for_solar/", "name": "t1_j8poa0h", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Calgary", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1676510776.0, "created_utc": 1676510776.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/113c8r7/skyfire_energy_for_solar/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qn40", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Shaw cell service sucks!", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Calgary", "link_author": "Eastcoastwobbler", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j8plfcp", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "cornfedpig", "num_comments": 75, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_113aqjt", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_467ot", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree but you can\u2019t really beat the price. $25/month if you have home internet. \n\nI don\u2019t have a ton of issues inside the city but outside city limits is a nightmare.
