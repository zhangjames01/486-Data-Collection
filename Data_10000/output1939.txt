Grew up playing tennis, love watching it still, but switched over to Pickleball for the social aspect. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fortunate to live in a county with ample public access to both tennis and Pickleball courts. Separate courts, not the same courts marked for both sports, but right next to each other. I&amp;#39;m seeing the opposite of what OP describes. The tennis courts are frequently empty, while the Pickleball courts are alive with people waiting to rotate in. As someone whose first love is tennis, it&amp;#39;s sad to see the empty tennis courts. Also sad to see the occasional guy who shows up with a bucket of balls to practice serves, and then they just stand and watch us all playing Pickleball having fun, and I remember being that guy who showed up to practice serves one day because I couldn&amp;#39;t find someone to play tennis with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To those of you saying Pickleball takes no skill: hilarious. I mean, I know what you&amp;#39;re talking about. A tennis background gives you a huge head start, and yeah, you&amp;#39;ll feel like a god the first time you play, even against players who consider themselves good. But if your community has a strong Pickleball contingent, you will eventually run into the people who were better at tennis than you, and they&amp;#39;ve been fully committed to Pickleball for years, and what they&amp;#39;re doing doesn&amp;#39;t look any different than what you&amp;#39;re doing, but they nevertheless kick your ass, repeatedly and easily. They will have you on a string. Yeah, you&amp;#39;ll get in a few good shots, a winner here and there, but you will get schooled. Your heart rate will go up, and you&amp;#39;ll wonder if you&amp;#39;ve ever really used your quads before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_w1edue", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/tennis/comments/w1edue/the_spread_of_pickleball_on_american_public_courts/igmtg3y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/w1edue/the_spread_of_pickleball_on_american_public_courts/", "name": "t1_igmtg3y", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/tennis", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1658146550.0, "created_utc": 1658146550.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/w1edue/the_spread_of_pickleball_on_american_public_courts/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3mcl5", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Demon sculpture 'Scrotum in Absurdum'", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ImaginaryNecronomicon", "link_author": "Mykhorrhiza", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iflwh8s", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "yourdungeonmaster", "num_comments": 6, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vvccmm", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_5qzsm", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You cast Find Familiar and this is what you get.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cast Find Familiar and this is what you get.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_vvccmm", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ImaginaryNecronomicon/comments/vvccmm/demon_sculpture_scrotum_in_absurdum/iflwh8s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNecronomicon/comments/vvccmm/demon_sculpture_scrotum_in_absurdum/", "name": "t1_iflwh8s", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ImaginaryNecronomicon", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1657468277.0, "created_utc": 1657468277.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/npuxukc88ma91.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2u6ne", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Unpopular opinion: Excellent technique is not crucial at 4.5 and below", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Pickleball", "link_author": "flabman1969", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ie3800t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "yourdungeonmaster", "num_comments": 32, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_vmtbvb", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_5qzsm", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Results trump form anyway, regardless of sport.
