Even when I met her in our 30s, my wife wasn't much of a thrill-ride person, and that has only increased over time. Therefore, your real customer base (especially for rides) starts, essentially, at birth increases to its peak demand age-range \u2014 which I would guess between 10-25 \u2014 and then begins to taper off. If you aren't targeting primarily that age range for a theme park (_any_ theme park), then you're a fool. I would guess that parents aren't the primary drivers of the decisions to go to theme parks and buy season passes, etc. Its kids _bugging_ parents that drive those decisions. Not catering/marketing to teenagers \u2014 whether they are spending their own money, or mom and dad's \u2014 is like an auto mechanic that only services cars that are under 10,000 miles. \n\n#4\nThey are trying to target families with events, but their events have _kept us away from going_. As a parent of younger children, one of whom still gets easily scared, we skipped a couple of opportunities to go during Mardis Gras \u2014 too much emphasis on drinking, Voodoo/skeleton crap, and we feared (don't know if this is the case, but we weren't going to risk it) exposure to a bunch of lewd/over-sexualized stuff. Oktoberfest Polka bands would be fun, but the holiday is primarily geared around drinking. Fright fest stuff (which absolutely can give my youngest nightmares) has been up all around the park since _mid-August_ at least \u2014 _really, SF?! Come on!_ All these events are _adult_ oriented and largely inappropriate for kids. If they're ramping this stuff up to attract families then they're idiots because it's having the exact opposite effect.\n\n#3, 5\nThe shows, food, setting, decor, etc. _are_ a big part of what will get older parents, grandparents, and non-thrill-seekers of any age to be willing to come to the park which, in turn, _does_ affect your total customer draw, e.g., if grandma and grandpa don't want to come (and help wrangle the kids while they're there), then maybe the parents are going to pick somewhere else to go that _everyone_ can enjoy a bit more. Case-in-point, my wife wanted to get passes to Sea World (but got outvoted). If I had been just a little less into roller coasters, then we would have gone the other way. If they _really_ want to attract more families, then they need to keep the shows going, add more variety, etc., but I think the shows were all completely gone the last couple of times we were there.\n\n#6\nHonestly, I think that SF needs to spend some serious effort in streamlining its offerings. This has been a bloated, confusing, convoluted mess through our entire experience with it. It took _hours_ over multiple days to figure out which membership/annual pass we should get when we bought a year ago, and it hasn't gotten any better. When I was purchasing, I could still find older pages live on the SF site (through the search) that had outdated info which really didn't aid in the confusion.

There should be, at most, 3 options clearly spelled out on the page: Single day ticket, gold pass, diamond pass. That's it.
