I highly recommend it for anyone, but in particular if you like the Chronicles of Narnia I think there's even more to recommend about it.\n\nWithout spoiling some of the big surprises, it's a science fiction series, but for the majority of the series it reads more like it's fantasy. It also (very very minor spoiler here) &gt;!connects to our world like the Narnia books, though in very different, more subtle ways!&lt;\n\nAlso I'm not sure if you're religious, but Wolfe's writing was heavily influenced by his faith just like Lewis' was, though again in very different ways. While Narnia is pure, straightforward allegory, Book of the New Sun has the fingerprints of his faith all over it, but if you try to take it as allegory you're going to have a bad time. Certain elements might make you think you're in for allegory, but the pieces don't fit together in that way. And actually my first time reading the book I left puzzled by people's insistence that it was so influenced by his faith. But on my second reading I started to see the ways it came out and I wondered how I missed it.\n\nWhich is a good segue into the other things I'll say about the series (and about Wolfe in general). His writing is very layered. If you just breeze through the book it's a solid but unremarkable story. What makes it great is the story between the pages, when you connect the dots and see what's there implicitly rather than explicitly. What Wolfe communicates by what he *doesn't* say rather than what he does. I keep going back to the story and each subsequent read is better than the one before it as I discover more and more hidden within the text. The world building is also done this way primarily, and it's incredibly rich and fully realized, but again he's not going to come out and tell you everything about the world, you have to take what he gives you and discover the rest. If that sound exhausting and not worth it, he might not be for you, but if you're intrigued by that I can't recommend it highly enough.\n\nAlso for what it's worth, the narration of the audiobook is excellent. It's Jonathan Davis, if you're familiar with him, and he's excellent. Also the prose itself is wonderful.
