I've had two short term relationships in that period, neither of which even approached 6 months.\n\nI have had boundaries around misogyny and alcoholism for a long time, and the tripwire for that is extremely sensitive. I also won't date people with opposite worldviews from me, which closed nearly all possibilities in the last state I lived in. I have managed to avoid being in physically or financially abusive relationships (I'm assuming), which were very common in the last community I lived in because of these boundaries. None of my boundaries have been around finances or cosmetics, though now that I am career track I have new expectations for a partner to be on career track. I am not the kind of person who bases my sense of self worth on whether I'm in a relationship anymore, and I've been cognizant that I'm better off single while working on myself for years now. The point is that there are tangible benefits for me at this stage at my life to be with a partner, and I deserve the fullness of those benefits and the rewards of investing in another person deeply. I love myself and want to be loved for it. I *haven't* settled, but now I'm questioning whether I will ever get there *unless* I settle. I am struggling with loneliness in general (living in a new community, haven't made a ton of friends, haven't explored much or gone out socially a lot) but the 15 year lack of emotional support is also starting to weigh on me. \n\nIn the original text I shared, I mentioned one person pressing my buttons about abandonment because he left me on read for days before replying. I broached the subject as diplomatically as I could without disclosing that it was really getting under my skin, and he sensitively took responsibility and apologized (promising reaction there!), but then did it again soon after. After waiting like 4 days again for a response, I just closed the match because I knew this was a boundary I used to be really horrible about upholding: while the guy is off being busy, I am spending all this time fretting and waiting by the phone, so to speak, desperate for validation through engagement. He's not thinking of me, while I'm obsessing over his next outreach. Then I end up blowing up about it later. This was a cycle I put to bed several years ago, before I started ACA, so I just couldn't fathom resuscitating it again, now. I'm also aware it sets an unsustainable precedent in how I'm willing to be treated, so I just dipped out after those 4 days of radio silence because he couldn't be bothered to even throw a bone of acknowledgement. He seemed a good enough guy - didn't spark my interest as keenly, but could have been a decent person if I hadn't withdrawn so early. \"Maybe I should have been more patient or open-minded?\" is what the part of me that believes I'm going to have to compromise on *something* in order to find a good partner says.\n\nI'm not worried about getting married later than counterparts in my family, so fortunately I'm not also beset by the plague of comparison in this. But I did want to have children of my own, and it really hurts my heart to think that could never be a possibility because I never got married or got married too late for a safe pregnancy. Truthfully, I probably am already out of the safe pregnancy window by leaps and bounds because of my age and weight. I debated having a child alone several years ago and ultimately didn't do it because I knew my life wasn't stable enough. I know in the next five years, I want to undertake more ambitions for myself that will mean if I do have children, I will need help. I just don't think it's feasible for me to be a single parent, which is the only reason I'm placing any importance on being married before starting a family.\n\nI know in the most logical part of my brain that if I had met someone 10 years ago, all my priorities in what to look for in a boyfriend would have been way off from what is healthy for me today. A sliver of me is grateful I'm not entrenched in a problematic relationship that I either have to be part of the solution of fixing, or extricating myself from right now to start over. I would like to think that now, I have my head on straight and would be able to attract the right kind of partner for myself. But I can't overlook how lonely of a stretch it has been, that there are absolutely some difficult trade-offs by having boundaries (if I ever have kids, I would be retiring when they go to/graduate from college), and that it isn't a daunting experience to slog through all the disappointments like this one along the way for those guys who are near-misses.",

               "body":"I am not a long timer (second birthday is 1/1/20), but I got deep enough into learning about the ACA structure and history to understand why what you've identified is the way it is. For example, I have really struggled to find sponsors. The two sponsors I did find, the relationships dissolved quickly because they had decades experience in AA or NA and brought that style of sponsorship into ACA and I got triggered. The sponsor from NA would also make a lot of critical statements comparing ACA and NA, favoring how NA phrases things, but I was on my end trying to make sense of what I'm supposed to do with that knowledge because ACA is/was my first and only 12-step. I don't belong to NA, so what am I supposed to do about it if ACA is weaker on whatever front?\n\nSo here's some of the history. I present this neutrally and with a sense of just to explain, not to provide excuses. You mentioned you've been in ACA a few years, but sounds like you've been in physical rooms. This is going to cover in-person rooms but also online meeting spaces. \n\nACA was created in 1978 by Tony A as an extension of Alateen. Bill W founded AA in 1935. The two knew each other, but Bill W is ~30 years older than Tony A. Point being that AA as an organization has had 40+ years of time to iron out the kinks, so to speak. I'm sure if you did a deep dive on AA, you could find a historical point where even AA was on the verge of collapse before they really figured it out.\n\nIn fact, from 1978-1984, ACA had a different 12 steps than what is now codified in the BRB, known as Tony A's original 12 steps. I don't know the thought process behind changing over to the current form, but the current steps much more closely mirror AA's language. Personally, I better identify with the original 12 steps as an ACA who has not been an alcoholic.\n\nI have heard from very long-timers in ACA (20+ years) that the '90s were super rough for the program and it nearly collapsed. In fact, ACA did not even have a core fellowship text until 2006. In the late '90s/early 2000s, the organization finally got together and solicited anecdotes and testimonials pertaining to the 12 steps, but I think prior to that, all new groups had a list of the steps and just freeform shared about their experience with the step. I hold that in contrast with the format of most meetings  today, where we read aloud some of the BRB and share about what we just read. Anyhow, fellowship text published in 2006, and then the yellow workbook was published a year later. \n\nFast forward 15 years and although ACA had grown, it was still in the low 1000s across the US (though had many groups across the globe). Then the pandemic struck and everyone's sense of self agency coincided with just the right level of convenience provided by a software app taking the whole country by storm called Zoom. Now, group numbers are going through the roof; many people dealing with the difficulties of self-isolation are starting to see the issues festering and turn to the internet for support; many newcomers who feel as you do that the warmth isn't there but believe that maybe they could do better if they strike out on their own; and now we have hundreds of fledgling online groups being organized and run by people who are totally winging it, have not spent years in another group to watch the organic growth and challenges, and do not have the spiritual maturity to sponsor.\n\nBut on top of all that, a huge number of people who started ACA in Zoom meetings are willing to transition into in-person meetings. So ACA had this exponential growth of newcomers who would attend in-person meetings as soon as those opened up again, and now that a lot of physical meetings are resuming, the balance between experienced and inexperienced is really out of whack. The lack of longevity and of enough people to sponsor was already endemic to ACA, but now let's throw on top of that an outnumbering amount of newcomers. On top of that, newcomers who started during Zoom are coming into the rooms with one set of expectations about the etiquette around sharing that maybe isn't translating into the kind of warmth of fellowship that in-person meetings are known for creating. Zoom members are really much more likely to immediately log out and not stay to build community as soon as meeting time ends, because they were squeezing in this meeting into their other time demands that day. They're not coming for fellowship, just for the text and being able to share or hear other shares. \n\nThat gets us caught up to today. It is a challenge that I think the ACA World Org needs to address, but it's a large body that moves slowly. I don't have direct suggestions for solutions, but this may help you understand why if you were seeing ACA as not as robust when you first joined, this is why it will struggle to become robust for a handful more years. Maybe it's a challenge for us who participate to step up and address it in our business meetings?",

I don&amp;#39;t belong to NA, so what am I supposed to do about it if ACA is weaker on whatever front?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s some of the history. I present this neutrally and with a sense of just to explain, not to provide excuses. You mentioned you&amp;#39;ve been in ACA a few years, but sounds like you&amp;#39;ve been in physical rooms. This is going to cover in-person rooms but also online meeting spaces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ACA was created in 1978 by Tony A as an extension of Alateen. Bill W founded AA in 1935. The two knew each other, but Bill W is ~30 years older than Tony A. Point being that AA as an organization has had 40+ years of time to iron out the kinks, so to speak. I&amp;#39;m sure if you did a deep dive on AA, you could find a historical point where even AA was on the verge of collapse before they really figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, from 1978-1984, ACA had a different 12 steps than what is now codified in the BRB, known as Tony A&amp;#39;s original 12 steps. I don&amp;#39;t know the thought process behind changing over to the current form, but the current steps much more closely mirror AA&amp;#39;s language. Personally, I better identify with the original 12 steps as an ACA who has not been an alcoholic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have heard from very long-timers in ACA (20+ years) that the &amp;#39;90s were super rough for the program and it nearly collapsed. In fact, ACA did not even have a core fellowship text until 2006. In the late &amp;#39;90s/early 2000s, the organization finally got together and solicited anecdotes and testimonials pertaining to the 12 steps, but I think prior to that, all new groups had a list of the steps and just freeform shared about their experience with the step. I hold that in contrast with the format of most meetings  today, where we read aloud some of the BRB and share about what we just read. Anyhow, fellowship text published in 2006, and then the yellow workbook was published a year later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 15 years and although ACA had grown, it was still in the low 1000s across the US (though had many groups across the globe). Then the pandemic struck and everyone&amp;#39;s sense of self agency coincided with just the right level of convenience provided by a software app taking the whole country by storm called Zoom. Now, group numbers are going through the roof; many people dealing with the difficulties of self-isolation are starting to see the issues festering and turn to the internet for support; many newcomers who feel as you do that the warmth isn&amp;#39;t there but believe that maybe they could do better if they strike out on their own; and now we have hundreds of fledgling online groups being organized and run by people who are totally winging it, have not spent years in another group to watch the organic growth and challenges, and do not have the spiritual maturity to sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But on top of all that, a huge number of people who started ACA in Zoom meetings are willing to transition into in-person meetings. So ACA had this exponential growth of newcomers who would attend in-person meetings as soon as those opened up again, and now that a lot of physical meetings are resuming, the balance between experienced and inexperienced is really out of whack. The lack of longevity and of enough people to sponsor was already endemic to ACA, but now let&amp;#39;s throw on top of that an outnumbering amount of newcomers. On top of that, newcomers who started during Zoom are coming into the rooms with one set of expectations about the etiquette around sharing that maybe isn&amp;#39;t translating into the kind of warmth of fellowship that in-person meetings are known for creating. Zoom members are really much more likely to immediately log out and not stay to build community as soon as meeting time ends, because they were squeezing in this meeting into their other time demands that day. They&amp;#39;re not coming for fellowship, just for the text and being able to share or hear other shares. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That gets us caught up to today. It is a challenge that I think the ACA World Org needs to address, but it&amp;#39;s a large body that moves slowly. I don&amp;#39;t have direct suggestions for solutions, but this may help you understand why if you were seeing ACA as not as robust when you first joined, this is why it will struggle to become robust for a handful more years. Maybe it&amp;#39;s a challenge for us who participate to step up and address it in our business meetings?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I don't know about you, but this realization has helped me tremendously to stop putting the burden of lovability on myself and put it back on the critical or neglectful members of my family. It's helped me realize I don't have to try to be worthy when either their worth meter is broken, or when they don't make it worthy to be worthy of them! Like awesome, I got my hypercritical and decrepit grandmother's approval -- WHAT A PRIZE.\n\nIt also means that people who don't know you well or don't know you at all aren't slighting you because of *you*, but that they have their own issues they're not dealing with with the most grace. In this second sense, you don't have to spend time wondering, \"Why does this always happen *to me*?\" and can shake things off to get back to your day.\n\nI completely understand feeling a sense of injustice when this is brought up because I think western media has taught us that there's always a resolution and comeuppance that follows conflict, so if we really do embrace the advice to not take things personally, it's like we are admitting that we don't deserve the resolution.\n\nBut in my experience, resolution is only something for stories and movies. Real life rarely comes with clear resolutions and conclusions. It's up to me and me alone to put something to rest, find and make meaning of it, and cope and move on positively and healthily from experiences. I find it more empowering to view life from this perspective that ***I*** get to decide endings instead of waiting forever for some external party to decide for me and ending up in a lurch of uncertainty forever.\n\nHope this helps expand understanding for you. Glad to hear you've attended a meeting. Thanks for sharing your thoughts here! It works if you work it.",
