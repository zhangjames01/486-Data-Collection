I don&amp;#39;t recall but I think it didn&amp;#39;t even &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; trackgen, but I did take a picture cuz I kinda liked it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You might look at the original and think &amp;quot;ehhhh, it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;#39;s got a few issues&amp;quot; but I look at it,  cross my eyes and think about what the track &lt;em&gt;could be&lt;/em&gt;, if the algorithm did X Y and Z.  It&amp;#39;s got the bones of a good track, just needs a little tweak here and there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And yeah, I&amp;#39;ve got a tool (mk0) that quickly allows the tracing of any track and allows tweaking of the geometry.  It even has the data right there so I can fiddle around with radii, lengths, curvatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I included what a possible twiddling might achieve, so you guys can see what I see when I look at a track cross eyed.  I mostly just changed the post pin awkward Ls and Rs and made em a proper squiggle sequence.  The other changes are minor.  And taking a look the track could be well served by a few more tweaks.  But remember,  you can easily go down a rabbit hole fiddling with corner geometries.  It&amp;#39;s the bones that matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently also watched the Chain Bear vid on Tilke.  So,  uh, yeah, the track is absolutely Tilkefied.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11uocil", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/RaceTrackDesigns/comments/11uocil/trackgen_musings_1_track_only_but_handtwea_oh_god/jcoyzjq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/RaceTrackDesigns/comments/11uocil/trackgen_musings_1_track_only_but_handtwea_oh_god/", "name": "t1_jcoyzjq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/RaceTrackDesigns", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1679145699.0, "created_utc": 1679145699.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://imgur.com/a/iCJuiEu"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "CMV: Depositors at SVB took a risk and lost.
