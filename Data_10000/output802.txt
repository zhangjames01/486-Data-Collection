Since i wager what was there was either bombed or looted by the soviets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To then work from that starting point towards autarky is far from ideal, but doable, as your experience shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also the human talent and skills translated in this fashion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days , so much is highly automated, software driven and/or on purpose reliant on foreign parts/licencing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add on top that Russia these days, has the skillset, and knowledgepool , to theoreticly produce fine end products, especially in the fields crossing over with defence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But their manufacturing base / knowledgepool of the production of every part in the chain before that. The machinery of production, the software etc used to design , you name it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all been steadily imported for a long time.\nUnless Russians would accept having their living standards drop significantly as their whole economy is rebuild and people reschooled, or schooled even. I don&amp;#39;t see it being viable in the least, if it ever even was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Autarky is a lot harder to realise in modern established economies, especially if said economy relies heavily on imports for production/maintance/knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t McGyver your way out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps, thanks for sharing your background though, my dad is obsessed with the DDR/Germany, so i can delight him with a nugget (:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zq7zpl", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/worldnews/comments/zq7zpl/russian_rouble_slumps_to_7month_low_biggest/j14agaw/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/zq7zpl/russian_rouble_slumps_to_7month_low_biggest/", "name": "t1_j14agaw", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/worldnews", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1671637911.0, "created_utc": 1671637911.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/rouble-plunges-below-68-per-dollar-hit-over-7-month-low-2022-12-19/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh13", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Russian rouble slumps to 7-month low, biggest one-day drop since July", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 40, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "worldnews", "link_author": "Straight_Ad2258", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j0xts01", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Gutterblade", "num_comments": 272, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j0xi16t", "score": 40, "author_fullname": "t2_69m6b", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If you picture an economy powered entirely from within, that means that all goods bought and sold, and thus produced must also come from within.\n\nDown to every chip, little led diode, software used in offices, turbine fans, drillbits etc etc\n\nYou get the picture.
