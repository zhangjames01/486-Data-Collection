Pretty terrible service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got better service at our Loews hotel then at the Disney hotel we stayed at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Disney. Incredibly good food nearly everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Universal. Mostly fast food. Better now with simpsons and HP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where you went to but the Universal I visited had lots of incredible table service food options. Mythos has been voted number one theme park restaurant how many years in a row? The &amp;quot;quick service&amp;quot; food we had at Universal was better than the stuff Disney &amp;quot;quick service&amp;quot; puts out.
