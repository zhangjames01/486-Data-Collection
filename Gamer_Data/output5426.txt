He was educated in the forest as his father was a hunter and so his anti-social nature took root from there, preferring the quiet forest to human distractions.

Bruises and broken bones were his preferred method of reminding her that what she wants comes at a price. \n\n\n\nWhile Gerald the Woodchopper did indeed accompany his father from time to time in the forest to hunt, it was never a matter of permission. Gerald junior had to watch from a distance or be chased off with arrows and beaten until he could not stand once his father returned.

It was very much the norm for him and it was only in speaking to his friend Carl Antwerp about ways of blocking out the sounds did he have any inkling that maybe his parents were not usual. \n\n\n\nHe was watching the fire like he did most nights, getting lost in the dancing flames trying to block out the sounds as usual, when two things happened that had never happened before.

Gerald did not see his father alive again. The corpse was found inside the pelt of a doe 2 days later. Slain for warmth, apparently he had frozen to death in the harsh winter night.

The Woodchopper felt genuine guilt for the first time while his father burned, he had caused this death and no one except he and his mother would ever know. \n\n\n\nThe guilt did not end there, barely a month later his mother too passed.

This was how he made his living, for 10 long years he did it, guilty and alone. He would occasionally drink with his childhood friend but never to excess and always found his way back to the hut he had inherited.\u2003\n\n\n\nAs ever with these things it was that same childhood friend that pushed him to marry so that some happiness could be found. A wife was found in Veronika of similar age and stature and so it was arranged. She was unmarried so old due to her lack of beauty and independent nature, her dowry was comparatively unimpressive. A trapper by trade Veronika fed her and her husband with small animals, when her traps failed Gerald traded his wood for meals.
