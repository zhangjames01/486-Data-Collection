By contrast, pan people use lots of different definitions of &amp;quot;pansexual.&amp;quot; Some of those definitions I relate to more strongly than the common definition of &amp;quot;bisexual,&amp;quot; but I value the fact that &amp;quot;bisexual&amp;quot; is an unambiguous label.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot of the definitions given for &amp;quot;pansexual&amp;quot; imply that the word &amp;quot;bisexual&amp;quot; is exclusionary of binary trans and/or nonbinary people, which is not true of how most people use the word. I frankly find OPs definition, which emphasizes sex over gender, reminiscent of those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: we should allow people to use the labels for themselves that they want,  but bisexuals are mostly consistent about what the label &amp;quot;bisexual&amp;quot; means, so when a very different definition for that word is given in an impersonal context, some disagreement seems ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_f14ruv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/pansexual/comments/f14ruv/bi_and_pan_solidarity/fh3bvxk/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pansexual/comments/f14ruv/bi_and_pan_solidarity/", "name": "t1_fh3bvxk", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/pansexual", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1581267228.0, "created_utc": 1581267228.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/0ovd8parcuf41.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2r6jm", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "\"Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken\" Ok then, what DID Sauron's forces call him?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 33, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "tolkienfans", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fddpnqe", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "classymathguy", "num_comments": 108, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_ekt297", "score": 33, "author_fullname": "t2_dlp1u", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I would guess - within the fiction that the story is an old text translated by Tolkien - that the translator included the detail about Sauron's underlings not using his name when it was a relevant plot point, but translated most instances of the Dark Lord's names to the single name 'Sauron' for clarity.\n\nOutside of that fiction, I think Tolkien might have simply forgotten this detail, or ignored it for clarity.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would guess - within the fiction that the story is an old text translated by Tolkien - that the translator included the detail about Sauron&amp;#39;s underlings not using his name when it was a relevant plot point, but translated most instances of the Dark Lord&amp;#39;s names to the single name &amp;#39;Sauron&amp;#39;
