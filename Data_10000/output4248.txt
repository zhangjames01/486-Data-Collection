At the time of release, Old Wa was exceptionally unique both in terms of mechanics and art design, and New Wa, while still pretty standout, is definitely *more* generic on both counts.\n\n**Mechanics**: Old Wa was a *weird* god--technically classed as a mage, but with a high focus on autoattacks and tower pushing, and better at both than Freya and Chronos (the only other two \"AA mages\" out at the time). So she was already unusual in taking the tower-wrecking approach over the Zeus-style giant AoE burst attack approach. But then on top of this she had a giant stealth cloud, minions, a skill that did more damage the *closer* she was to a target and that could damage towers, and a low-cooldown zoning ult. Plus, her passive gave her a very interesting tempo mechanic where you would need to pay attention to her buffs and time your skills accordingly to maximize their time--oftentimes you would use a skill earlier or later than you really needed just to trigger the crystal buff you needed or enter snake form. Having this diversity of skills also opened her build options--you could push attack speed, try and deal more damage with flamestrike, or do the trolly max CDR+sprint+isolation build where you were running around at high speed, permanently shrouded in a fog ball that slowed your enemies.\n\nAfter redesign, her passive became a \"once every X basic attacks\" passive, which many gods already had (although it did preserve a bit of her AA feel, as noted by /u/xXZanza), her fog became more of a line skillshot, her flamestrike ACTUALLY became a line skillshot that just does damage, and her minions became a CC/burst tool. So, she moved into the bursty mage territory, which was already pretty full. To be fair, the new ult gave her some uniqueness back, as did the combo with the minions, but overall, a net loss.\n\n**Art design**: Old Wa was LIKE A BOSS. She had a deep voice that was rare among the female cast (the next mage after her was Scylla, for example), turned into a snake monster regularly, and the sound of her AAs landing had some weight behind it--very visceral. After rework, she turned into an underboobed hovering mage (already had a lot of them at the time, still do), got a much less commanding voice (when they actually reworked it it was even wimpier, they re-recorded the voice after a couple weeks), and she only turned into an immortal white snake when she died or for mere seconds when ulting. It sort of felt like \"well whats the point of playing as a badass snake goddess if I'm no longer badass, and if I also spend less than 30 seconds per game actually being a snake?\" So, a more generic on this front too.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of New Wa (first diamond skin), I love fire sharding enemies as they flee, and the recent release of Sol brings back a lot of the same tower-wrecking, tempo-based, AA mage feel. But sometimes I just wanna turn into a snake and be a boss.\n\n**tl;dr** we miss Old Wa because she was unique and New Wa is decently unique but less so.", "edited": 1448008712.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "featured", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "/r/SmiteGodConcepts"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, I think it comes down to something pretty simple, which is that unique characters in any game stand out and develop followings more than generic, forgettable characters.

To be fair, the new ult gave her some uniqueness back, as did the combo with the minions, but overall, a net loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art design&lt;/strong&gt;: Old Wa was LIKE A BOSS. She had a deep voice that was rare among the female cast (the next mage after her was Scylla, for example), turned into a snake monster regularly, and the sound of her AAs landing had some weight behind it--very visceral. After rework, she turned into an underboobed hovering mage (already had a lot of them at the time, still do), got a much less commanding voice (when they actually reworked it it was even wimpier, they re-recorded the voice after a couple weeks), and she only turned into an immortal white snake when she died or for mere seconds when ulting. It sort of felt like &amp;quot;well whats the point of playing as a badass snake goddess if I&amp;#39;m no longer badass, and if I also spend less than 30 seconds per game actually being a snake?&amp;quot; So, a more generic on this front too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of New Wa (first diamond skin), I love fire sharding enemies as they flee, and the recent release of Sol brings back a lot of the same tower-wrecking, tempo-based, AA mage feel. But sometimes I just wanna turn into a snake and be a boss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; we miss Old Wa because she was unique and New Wa is decently unique but less so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3thxb3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Smite/comments/3thxb3/why_do_people_like_old_nu_wa_so_much/cx6nnrx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/3thxb3/why_do_people_like_old_nu_wa_so_much/", "name": "t1_cx6nnrx", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Smite", "author_flair_text": "/r/SmiteGodConcepts", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1448000957.0, "created_utc": 1448000957.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/3thxb3/why_do_people_like_old_nu_wa_so_much/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ym13", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "A Zeratul haiku.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 12, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "heroesofthestorm", "link_author": "blastron", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cvtdc1t", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "toriarata", "num_comments": 98, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cvsyi6m", "score": 12, "author_fullname": "t2_9vxn5", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I took a go at it:\n\n\u843d\u3061\u306a\u3044\u8449\n\n\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u7d2b\u96fb\n\n\u66b4\u864e\u99ae\u6cb3\n\n\"Unfalling leaves\n\nSword-flashes of plasma\n\n...a foolish advance\"", "edited": 1444448706.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a go at it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u843d\u3061\u306a\u3044\u8449&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u7d2b\u96fb&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u66b4\u864e\u99ae\u6cb3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unfalling leaves&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sword-flashes of plasma&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...a foolish advance&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_3o0h16", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3o0h16/a_zeratul_haiku/cvtdc1t/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3o0h16/a_zeratul_haiku/", "name": "t1_cvtdc1t", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/heroesofthestorm", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1444364177.0, "created_utc": 1444364177.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3o0h16/a_zeratul_haiku/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2xy2u", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "June Update!

The basic idea on the design is true to the lore and permeates the concept well. However--\n\nThe main issue I see with this kit is that it is a VERY CC-heavy mage kit rather than a guardian kit, combining the best parts of either class but few of the weaknesses. For instance, every single one of Fuujin/Raijin's moves deals damage--of the guardians, this is only true of Sobek, and his damage is VERY melee and he lacks a lot of the utility Fuujin/Raijin have. I see that you kept the numbers down to guardian scaling for the most part, but fundamentally the problem is the nature of the moves themselves rather than the numbers: the kit contains a safe crippling projectiles with short cooldown, a CC move that also damages, and a dash that CCs/damages/repositions (Storm Chaser itself is functionally very similar to Fenrir's ult, but plus a bunch of extra stuff, as a normal skill). Lastly, the ult removes Fuujin/Raijin from the field so they can nuke an area without fear of being damaged (Like Freya, Rama, Nu Wa, etc), rather then leaving them out to draw fire and disrupt /support for their team (Ymir, Hades, etc). Basically, you need to either strip out a lot of the strong CC (stun, carry, disorient, cripple, banish are all already in the kit) in favor of mage damage, or strip out a lot of the damage (and tone the CC down anyways) in favor of a more guardiany kit. You can try to make it a little of both, but right now its a lot of both.\n\nThe other thing is the nature of the contest. Right now both Fuujin and Raijin level up to 5 independently as their moves are used. However, it seems like for much of the game, the lightning skillshot projectile will get used more to harass and laneclear, whereas the short-range CC windstorm will only get used when making a play on an enemy god. It seems that Raijin will generally level up first, which you don't really want on a duality-themed god. Lastly, both Fuujin's Fury and Raijin's Rage are on rather short cooldown, so it doesn't seem like its that difficult to reach max stacks on the passive before using the ult at all. Maybe a tug-of-war system might be better, where the meter goes back and forth between the two extremes? This might make the system more dynamic and would still get the sibling rivalry theme across.\n\nWhew. Sorry this went on for so long.

Once again, sorry the concepts are so similar, I&amp;#39;ll check around next time I put something out to see if anyone&amp;#39;s already done it.
