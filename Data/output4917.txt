And it was not only women who learned to play, entire families could have a musical education and play at home. Some (the exception) invested a lot of time and effort, hired top musicians to get lessons, and became very good. The children of well doing families would also take drawing and painting lessons.\n\n\\&gt; did any of these well-bred women ultimately become composers?\n\nIf you mean write music for domestic use, yes, it would not be too rare to write some dances or songs.\n\nNow to the longer version. I can only offer a general idea, since I am not terribly into the social aspects of music, or Regency England.\n\nI think you are really asking about women being ***professional*** musicians, which is a very different thing, for both men and women in high society. Let's start with what applies to both, and then we get to the specific situation of women.\n\nThe conception of musicians as artists, and not just mere servants doing their job, is quite advanced but still being developed during this time. A century before this period musicians were clearly... servants, not particularly relevant people. By the end of the Regency the idea of music being an art and musicians being talented and important is closer to what we have now, but not quite there. In this period musicians were becoming some kind of professionals.\n\nSo, would the high-society and nobles want to be professional musicians? No, not at all. Why would they? It was beneath them. Can you imagine a princess wanting to become a cobbler? Yeah, being a musician would not sound much more acceptable than that.\n\nWhat about landowning and professional families? It sounds less insane, but not all occupations would be on the same level. What would be more appropriate for a respectable family: being a military officer, a successful law professional and politician, or a... musician?\n\nNow, what about women during this period? The women in these families were expected to get a suitable husband, have children, and take care of domestic affairs. They were not public figures, would not have a profession, and were not really supposed to work. This is not compatible with becoming a professional musician, so becoming a famous composer was not really an option.\n\nCould these women work? Yes, if it came to that. An unmarried woman could be some sort of governess or perhaps teach, but for middle and upper class young women this was seen as something below their status, and not all would have sufficient education to teach. These were rather domestic, indoors occupations, working at a small businesses in public was not a thing for these women.\n\nWere there any women with a career in music during this period? Yes, yes there were.\n\nMaria Hester Reynolds (1760-1813) was a pianist, singer, composer, and teacher. She gave  recitals on piano and harpsichord before getting married, after that she became a teacher and composer. Her pupils were from the nobility, so she must have been very well regarded as a teacher, and her music was popular in England. She corresponded with F. J. Haydn, who was THE top composer in continental Europe and was extremely well received in England to the end of his life.\n\nHere is  a piano sonata by her: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNf2lUN4Ojw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNf2lUN4Ojw)\n\nJane Mary Guest (1762-1846) was a composer and pianist, who studied with J. C. Bach (son of of J. S. Bach, the youngest member of the Bach dynasty of awesome composers). She would give public performances and published music in the 1780s. Later, she taught the daughters of the Royal Family.\n\nHere is a recording of one of her sonatas (which were very popular): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg0-4i-NdqA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg0-4i-NdqA)\n\nI mention their connection to these famous men as a reference, because these women were not from super rich families. Being a student of J. C. Bach at the top of his career, or corresponding and exchanging music manuscripts with Haydn do not sound like average amateur musician.\n\nStopping completely, or at least reducing a lot their public performances after being married, is something we see in the lives of many women in music.\n\nIf you are interested in reading about some other women in music history: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3niee0/it\\_was\\_common\\_for\\_upperclass\\_european\\_women\\_prior/cvoj4p7/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3niee0/it_was_common_for_upperclass_european_women_prior/cvoj4p7/)\n\nThe lives and careers of Fanny Mendelssohn, Clara Wieck, and Amy Beach would be  relevant to your question in terms of the possibilities of a career in music for women during the 19th century. The executive summary: among the few women who had a career in music we see that it  helped enormously to be born in a family of musicians, or have some wealth. Their performing career was pretty much over once they married, during most of the 19th century (Clara Wieck is a big exception, because her professional life had pretty much all the highlights any top notch pianist could want today). Their compositions were mostly for piano solo, voice and piano, or small ensembles.

Yes, it was quite different, but I would not say it was *totally* different.\n\n&gt;And wouldn\u2019t they sound different too?\n\nYes, they did sound different.\n\n&gt;How do we know that the G Mozart played when he composed is the same G we play today?\n\nThis is a bit trickier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the whole thing with more details.\n\nIn general we call these early instrument a fortepiano, piano is the modern thing. I will mention things that might fall a bit before or after Mozart's life, to give you a general idea.\n\nSo, the fortepiano is a different beast, they were not as standardized as our modern instruments (that by modern engineering standards are not terribly *standard*) and they changed with time. How different was it, in what way? They were shorter, they didn't have the curvy shape we have now (there was a bit of curvature, but in general they had more straight lines).  They were not black (they were... brown... you could see the wood/veneer, even if some extra finish was applied), they frequently had more than three legs. There were no upright pianos in that period. These instruments were more decorated, not just a massive shiny thing painted in one color.\n\nFortepianos were not so heavy. Many pianos today are not completely made out of wood, and have some synthetic stuff (saw dust plus glue is a simple way to describe it) and that adds a bit of weight, but not just because of that. Modern pianos today have a massive chunk of metal that holds the strings (this is called the harp, and it's made of cast iron). See, the strings have stupid amounts of tension these days, that was not the case at the time and there was no need for that massive iron thing. Wood was sufficient to build a frame that was strong enough. They eventually added some metal to reinforce the structure (they wanted louder instruments and that requires more string tension, so they would need a more solid structure).\n\nThe strings of a modern piano are made of steel and some are wound in copper, back then they were made of iron and brass (for the lower notes, copper was also used like in modern instruments). We found that they were not using the best string parameters in many cases (see, not all strings are of the same gauge... choosing the proper length, gauge, and wounding for strings are important decisions that affect several other things in piano design.\n\nThere were not as many strings, because the keyboard had less keys (the earliest pianos had only four octaves and the keyboard slowly became larger), and because each key would have at most two strings (eventually three). Keys were shorter than they are now (both the part of the key that you see in the outside and the part that is inside the piano), and narrower. The key tops were not made of plastic, but of wood, bone, or ivory. They black/white colour scheme of the keys was inverted at first.\n\nThe hammers of a modern piano are covered in compressed wool, they were covered in leather at the time (yes, that changes the sound and volume). The mechanism that hits the string when you press a key was also rather different (way less complicated), that changes a lot how the instrument feels when you play. Fortepianos at first had no pedals, they were more like levers that you would control with your knee (or knobs/sliders that you would control with your hands).\n\nFortepianos had (in some cases) more than two pedals/levers/whatever (he extra ones were for some effects). You could have a moderator and this would put a piece of soft material (such as wool) between the hammers and the strings. This is similar to the strange middle pedal thing modern upright pianos have (so that you can \"practice\" without being too loud... that crap is quite useless and would not recommend people to use it, except for the most dire situations). Fortepianos could have a piece of would covered in a softer material to... thump... the lowest strings. Yeah, this thing would produce a drum-like effect, and would have bells attached (this makes a lot of sense for the Turkish march, because the damn thing was imitating some bits of a march played by a Turkish military band in Vienna). This thumping thing is called a Janissary (an Ottoman rookie soldier). There was another weird thing: the *bassoon*. A roll of parchment covered by silk, this would be in contact with the strings to mute the bass and produce a strange buzzing sound. They were very creative with their effect thingies. The middle pedal in a modern piano is the sostenuto (it keeps the dampers up just for the keys pressed before using that pedal), it is a 19th century invention.\n\nI think that's the general idea. Let's get to the last question.\n\nWould a G produce the same frequency we would expect today? No, it would not. The timbre is very, very different because of the materials and construction of the instrument. Modern instruments are WAY louder. and don't have the effect pedals. Also, the damn notes would not be the same. Why?\n\nFirst, we mostly have a reference of A4 = 440 Hz. That was not a thing... Pitch has been all over the place (way lower and way higher than 440 Hz for A4 in most places and periods before the late 19th century or early 20th).\n\nSecond, the intervals were a bit different, too. See, not all semi-tones were of the same size back then, and there were different temperaments back then. This means different tonalities actually had a different character, because of the available intervals. The differences might not be equally noticeable in all cases (just by considering the maths, we have to also think about how good was the person tuning the instrument).\n\nYou might be interested in some videos:\n\nThis is the earliest fortepiano we have:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2WdjyKQ57A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2WdjyKQ57A)\n\nYou can hear in this video the different pedal effects I mentioned  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7Rcd\\_pxisU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7Rcd_pxisU)\n\nSome temperaments (it's quite a broad subject) are demonstrated in this video  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBt6APk21tU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBt6APk21tU) \n\nThere's quite a lot of stuff for earlier instruments, and of course this has a massive impact in performance.

They would get their music and there would be a page listing the names of the subscribers.

Yes, some.\n\nWere they simply there for the pleasure of royalty? Not always royalty, but most were  in the employment of some institution or rich household, and/or trying to find gigs wherever/whenever possible.\n\nWas the invention of broadcasting (radio/TV) what led to the rise in prominence of entertainers into celebrity status? I can't answer that, but there were celebrities before that (in different conditions and not on a global scale, but we can say they were known in all of Europe, for example).\n\n\\-----\n\nSo we can say some  musicians are celebrities, artists, geniuses, and some other categories. They mean different things, but applying those to somebody in the music world  has not always been normal.\n\nBefore the 18th century music was not \"fine art\" practiced by \"artists.\" Music was what musicians made, just like bakers made bread.  Our ideas of \"art\" started to appear around the so called Enlightenment. Plumbers are skilled people who are experts in plumbing matters, but they are not widely considered artists, are they? It was the same for musicians.\n\nWho is a celebrity? Well, some one who is very famous. Let's talk about two celebrities, both singers, from the 18th century.\n\nFirst, Francesca Cuzzoni. She was an Italian soprano, daughter of a professional violinist. She started her musical career at 18 ( around 1714) and quickly found herself singing operas in Parma, Bologna, Venice, Florence, Milan, Turin, Padua... She was invited to sing in London, and was mentioned in the newspapers of the time. Handel wrote several roles for her (other very famous composers also wrote roles for her, but they are not famous now), and people were paying stupid amounts of money for tickets to those performances (she was being making bank). People talked about the dresses she wore, some saying that clothing was vulgar but many women started to wear them!  She had rivals, and shared the stage with them some times, and people would be shouting, hissing, clapping, yelling and what not while they were performing. These rivalries were also in the newspapers of the time. \n\n[Here's a recording of a fantastic aria composed for her.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvWmMUu9O58) In that part, Cleopatra is asking the Heavens to save her (her brother Ptolemy wanted her head). If you don't mind spoilers, Julius Caesar saves the day. That opera has several outstanding arias.\n\nFarinelli (Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola Broschi) was another Italian singer. He was also born in a family of musicians and showed great talent. The family decided to castrate him (yeah, castrated singers were very popular back then), probably under some economic problems (they wanted the boy to make money for them). People said \"he fell from a horse and hurt himself\" or something like that to explain the need for the... procedure. Anyways, the details are quite something, there was an old post about this here in AH if you are interested. \n\nHe was soon singing all around Europe, getting all sorts of important roles composed for him and having royalty gifting him expensive jewelry. At 32 he was made chamber musician to the King of Spain, leaving public stages for good. He became influential at court, becoming friends with the royals.\n\n[Here's an aria composed for him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og29n0VxhZQ)\n\nThere was all sorts of gossip about the castrati, they were the super stars (making more money than women, and being in high demand for operas). Their... peculiar nature might have played a role in the fame that surrounded them. \n\nLet's go a few decades forward in time to talk about another famous musician. Franz Liszt. He was a French-Hungarian pianist, and pretty much created the \"rockstar\" stereotype in the 19th century. He was an insanely talented pianist AND composer, and was very active and very vocal in the musical and social world. The term Lisztomania was created to refer to the frenzy during his performances in the 1840s. Large groups of fans would surround him, women trying to get locks of his hair (seriously, they had scissors). Imagine ladies fighting over his handkerchiefs and gloves. The fans commissioned jewelry with his face. The man made a show out of breaking piano strings, and fans would fight to get the damn string to make bracelets. They collected the dregs left in his coffee (seriously, there were girls carrying bottles and following him) and the cigar stumps he threw. \n\nHe was a showman, the ladies thought he was super good looking, his scandalous love life... He was stupid good at piano, and composed some super showy music. Here are a couple videos (imagine Franz playing THAT and leaving the stage like a boss, leaving a handkerchief and then a mob fighting over it... a normal evening)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmq5JBpFf9w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmq5JBpFf9w)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk8M13ptQqc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk8M13ptQqc)\n\nOne more story for the road...\n\nFrederick Chopin was a friend of Liszt, a way more subtle pianist and composer who disliked performance in public. His music was super revolutionary and EVERYBODY wanted to write music like his. He had tons of admirers, and tons of students. Everybody in high society knew him, everybody wanted him and Liszt attending their social events and hopefully have them play something. Anyways, he had tuberculosis for many years and died quite young. He had the most rockstar funeral.\n\nImagine [this church](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Madeleine_Paris.jpg/1280px-Madeleine_Paris.jpg) in Paris covered in black velvet, with a cartouche with his initials (FC) silver-embroidered. Only ticket holders were allowed in, but there were thousands outside. People traveled from all the European capitals (his funeral was two weeks after he died, in October 1849). [This one-hour Requiem](https://youtu.be/54h8TxJyNy0?t=96) was performed during the ceremony with a big orchestra and chorus. His heart was presumably smuggled to his native Poland (inside a jar of cognac). \n\n[Here's a great Chopin recital with a terrific young pianist](https://youtu.be/TCILgM1NEts?t=13).\n\nThe rank and file musicians did not live such lives, and their situation is often comparable to that of many musicians, dancers, actors, painters, and others today: trying to get a permanent position at some institution (not the greatest money, but it's steady income), and always trying to get gigs, have students, get some work commissioned... MANY MANY average artists, musicians, entertainers, creative people, whatever you want to call them, are going through difficult times in these crazy pandemic days.
