If I'm understanding you correctly, you're defining complex as number of individual characters, while I'm defining it as functional complexity. I think you're wrong in both cases, because here's how I understand it.\n\n*In theory,* any given hanzi character can be drafted into the kanji system at any time should the need arise. So again, *in theory,* the potential number of individual characters in the complete Japanese script will always be greater than the potential number of characters in hanzi, because Japanese is hanzi plus other stuff.\n\nHOWEVER, I know that in practice kanji only consists of a subset of hanzi in terms of everyday use. The thing is, hanzi only consists of a subset of hanzi in everyday use, just like English only consists of a subset of the OED in everyday use, etc. And I don't think \"number of characters\" is the ideal way to measure complexity; rather, \"number of rules and variants and exceptions\" is the better measure. After all, we began this whooooooole thread talking about why languages have silent letters. Spelling/phonetics mismatches are a great example of what makes a language's written rules complex.\n\nAlso, it seems to me you're contradicting yourself a bit in your argument. You're saying Chinese is more complex because of the slight variants on individual signs...but the variations between hiragana and katakana aren't important. Huh? You accept one but dismiss the other? How does one decide which variations are important and which aren't? Are we taking a protractor and slide rule to the individual lines now?\n\nYou also dismiss the furigana (THANK YOU for supplying the name by the way; couldn't remember it for the life of me) because it's only used in manga and kids' books. That's like saying a symbol set isn't important because it's only used in newspapers. Do you have any idea how HUGE a portion of the Japanese publishing industry you're talking about? (Children's publishing is huge in ANY language, but manga is one of the few genres of printed Japanese with international demand.) You may not think its content is important, but it's numerically significant, and that's what I'm talking about. \n\nI'd bet you a shiny nickel, too, that the number of manga produced in the original Japanese in a year outstrips by an order of magnitude the number of books on...oh, say, Tertullian the early 3rd century Christian theologian printed in hanzi every year, to choose an example not quite at random. And that's what a lot of those variants on hanzi are used for: obscure, specialist topics. Yeah, they exist, but they're just not a statistically significant part of the language. And the irony is, if those books were translated into Japanese, you'd use furigana to clarify the pronunciations of the obscure kanji that appeared in them, because that's their *other* use.\n\nAnd all this *still* leaves you with the square-peg-round-hole problem. Hanzi's forms are fairly predictable, being about 85% logophonetic, 10% semantic, and a scattering of everything else. (Pardon if these aren't the terms you learned; I hear different variants.) When a new word enters the lexicon, most of the time, it's going to get the logophonetic treatment, unless it's a foreign proper noun that really doesn't suit the phonetic conventions of Mandarin. When a new word enters Japanese...all bets are fucking off. In theory, the whole damn language could just be written in hiragana (as *Genji* proves), or another kana script...hell, from what I understand, the script used in the Zelda games is a functional Japanese syllabary.
