We&amp;#39;d been married over 5 years, and I decided that whether or not there was cheating when he&amp;#39;d already started pulling away wouldn&amp;#39;t help me (I live in a no fault state, so it wouldn&amp;#39;t be considered in the divorce). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Telling me it would be better, that I would be okay and could get through it did not help. Being present with me and letting me cry, be mad, or feel whatever I was feeling helped. It also helped when my agency was respected - I was not okay with people make decisions for me when I was struggling to process a lot of pain from a decision my then-husband made without me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely encourage her to talk to an attorney, but remember that she is the one who has to go through this and who has to decide how she gets through it. Be there, be supportive, and if you can help her to have structure (gym, regular weekly things, etc) that might be good. But don&amp;#39;t expect her to believe that it&amp;#39;ll be okay. She&amp;#39;s mourning an entire lifetime of what could have been. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last note - when I finished getting divorced and was able to get some distance from it, I realized how lucky I was that my ex was able to see that we weren&amp;#39;t working. We were miserable and I didn&amp;#39;t know how to change things because they were familiar and it felt like it was too late. It just took a LOT of therapy, time, and distance to see that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_otxxkg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/otxxkg/my_f30_sisterinlaw_m40_is_going_through_a_divorce/h6zv4ee/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/otxxkg/my_f30_sisterinlaw_m40_is_going_through_a_divorce/", "name": "t1_h6zv4ee", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/relationships", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1627588454.0, "created_utc": 1627588454.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/otxxkg/my_f30_sisterinlaw_m40_is_going_through_a_divorce/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qjvn", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I'm old (48f), somewhat disabled and want to leave my partner (49m) but he tells me I'll sink without him and he's correct.
