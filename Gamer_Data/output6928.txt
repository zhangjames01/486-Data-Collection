It was just Joel in an emotionless state casually killing everyone with no problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just didn&amp;#39;t have the same feeling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the game, you 100% had to fight your way to Ellie and the fireflies didn&amp;#39;t go down easy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It put you in that role of a parent fighting tooth and nail to save their child. That they weren&amp;#39;t fighting to save their own life in this shootout, but to save their kids. And they&amp;#39;d do anything it took.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just didn&amp;#39;t get that feeling from the shows very short montage of Joel slowly killing everyone while in a daze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I know &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; Ellie said &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m stating the way they had her say it fast then abruptly cut to the credits was awkward and didn&amp;#39;t make me feel the intended effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they had had her say ok then lingered on her staring at him with mistrust and doubt for a moment before panning away to the shot of Wyoming or even a shot of Joel looking back with guilt, before cutting to the credits, it would have been better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would provide the time to feel that, not just a very quick &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; /fin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, my entire issue with the finale is in execution. It has all the story beats from the game. Everything is there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It just doesn&amp;#39;t have the same level of impact the games finale did because it was too rushed. There wasn&amp;#39;t time taken to let the viewer feel the intended feelings of each scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything just happens very fast and then it&amp;#39;s over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11q1alh", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ThelastofusHBOseries/comments/11q1alh/why_am_i_feeling_the_story_worked_better_as_a_game/jc2hgpq/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ThelastofusHBOseries/comments/11q1alh/why_am_i_feeling_the_story_worked_better_as_a_game/", "name": "t1_jc2hgpq", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ThelastofusHBOseries", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678722550.0, "created_utc": 1678722550.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ThelastofusHBOseries/comments/11q1alh/why_am_i_feeling_the_story_worked_better_as_a_game/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2hf092", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Why am I feeling the story worked better as a game?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ThelastofusHBOseries", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jc0zcrk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "ikarikh", "num_comments": 10, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_11q1alh", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_go2yt", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I think the show was great up until the finale.
