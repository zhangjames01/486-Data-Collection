Quite frequently, guys who have made the switch find that their shaves are much better, an observation reinforced by the comments from significant other, children, and/or grandchildren that their face is not so scratchy as it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;QUALITY OF LIFE - DE shaving improves one&amp;#39;s quality of life. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental benefits&lt;/em&gt; - These are obvious: much less landfill fodder and many fewer noxious chemicals involved in traditional shaving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal benefits&lt;/em&gt; - This was the clincher for me: shaving went from a tedious, boring, hateful chore to a real pleasure, something I look forward to each morning and truly enjoy. It makes a significant psychological difference to begin the day with taking care of yourself while doing something you enjoy rather than hurrying through something you hate. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_8n2sl9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wicked_edge/comments/8n2sl9/other_than_cost_is_there_any_benefit_of_de_razors/dztnpkb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/8n2sl9/other_than_cost_is_there_any_benefit_of_de_razors/", "name": "t1_dztnpkb", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wicked_edge", "author_flair_text": "Print/Kindle Guide to Gourmet Shaving", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1527690796.0, "created_utc": 1527690796.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/8n2sl9/other_than_cost_is_there_any_benefit_of_de_razors/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s46m", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Slight Acne and DE", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "wicked_edge", "link_author": "robbiecee2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dyrz4iz", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Leisureguy", "num_comments": 8, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dyrplfh", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_11hso", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I should point out that there's more in the *Guide*.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "7", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should point out that there&amp;#39;s more in the &lt;em&gt;Guide&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_8ieca2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/wicked_edge/comments/8ieca2/slight_acne_and_de/dyrz4iz/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/8ieca2/slight_acne_and_de/", "name": "t1_dyrz4iz", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/wicked_edge", "author_flair_text": "Print/Kindle Guide to Gourmet Shaving", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1525987337.0, "created_utc": 1525987337.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/8ieca2/slight_acne_and_de/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rcyx", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "headphones irl", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "headphones", "link_author": "VMorkva", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dymj9sk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Leisureguy", "num_comments": 67, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dymi3c9", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_11hso", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The splash is pretty moisturizing, perhaps because of the emu oil.
