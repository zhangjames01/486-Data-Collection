Did you mean something different, and if so, what did you mean by it?\n\n2) We agree on some things, but you're not understanding my argument, since it is not the traditional argument (especially as you've described it). I gave a summary of Plato's argument for why philosophy, *as he understood it\u2014*not the very ambiguous phrase, \"intellectual development\"\u2014may be more likely to grow in a democracy than not. \"Free speech\" is a part of his argument, but \"informed deliberation, coupled with the intensity of human interaction and decision-making\" is not. In Plato's view, entering into such informed deliberation\u2014that is, entering into the political life\u2014*prevents* one from philosophizing (see *Republic VI* or the *Apology*).\n\n3) Similarly, I'm not arguing here about Athenian exceptionalism. I'm arguing that the work of a very small number of Athenians are in fact exceptional.\n\n4) To address the questions in your third paragraph:\n\n4a) Plato does not argue that democracy and wealth is a *sufficient* condition to produce philosophic genius. Furthermore, since he also puts forth the argument that such philosophic geniuses are exceedingly rare (see again *Republic VI*), it seems that he would not expect such geniuses to pop up in democracies. Them doing so is the exception, not the norm.\n\n4b) I answered the question about Baghdad and Cordoba\u2014or at least Al-Farabi and Maimonides\u2014in my original post.

I certainly won't assume that everyone's reasons are the same. And I would expect that most people's reasons are unsatisfactory, prejudiced, or both.\n\nBut your argument seems to me that none of the Greeks mentioned were really great, or at least as great as we have thought them to be (I know you agree that some of them had \"quite exceptional minds\"). As you say, they were just representative of the \"upper crust,\" and in fact the idea that they were great is completely conventional: we are just \"perpetuating a notion born out of what Athens was like at this time.\"\n\nBut I am arguing, by looking at the texts themselves, that the greatness of these texts do not seem to be completely conventional and that their greatness is not only \"a notion born out of what Athens was like at this time.\" I also again just don't really know what that means.

As you say, they were just representative of the &amp;quot;upper crust,&amp;quot; and in fact the idea that they were great is completely conventional: we are just &amp;quot;perpetuating a notion born out of what Athens was like at this time.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I am arguing, by looking at the texts themselves, that the greatness of these texts do not seem to be completely conventional and that their greatness is not only &amp;quot;a notion born out of what Athens was like at this time.&amp;quot; I also again just don&amp;#39;t really know what that means. If one is attracted to Plato because one is attracted by his presentation of Socrates, how could this be explained by &amp;quot;a notion born out of what Athens was like at this time,&amp;quot; when Athens at the time was not attracted by Socrates but executed him for being who he was?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_r2urd2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskHistorians/comments/r2urd2/athens_a_small_city_of_250k_gave_rise_to_a/hmcc8mt/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/r2urd2/athens_a_small_city_of_250k_gave_rise_to_a/", "name": "t1_hmcc8mt", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskHistorians", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1638060869.0, "created_utc": 1638060869.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/r2urd2/athens_a_small_city_of_250k_gave_rise_to_a/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Athens, a small city of 250k, gave rise to a miracle in 500 BC and produced Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Aristophanes, Xenophon, Sophocles, Archimedes, Euclid, Pythagoras, Thucydides, Herodotus, Solon, Pericles, etc \u2014 it seems so unlikely!

I will point to one piece of evidence (other than the very fact that he gives the Spartan side an equal hearing in his book to the Athenian side) that implies, at the very least, that he was ultimately critical of Pericles and a partisan of neither Athenian democracy nor oligarchy. After the failure of the Athenian exhibition, 400 Athenians overthrew the democracy and established an oligarchy. Shortly afterwards, this oligarchy was overthrown, and a mixed democracy/oligarchy of 5000 was established. Speaking about this regime, Thucydides asserts:\n\n&gt;And to no small extent, for the first time, in my lifetime at least, the Athenians were evidently well-governed (VIII.97)\n\nThis shows that Thucydides was by no means a partisan of Pericles\u2014nor was he a partisan of democracy or oligarchy. simply. He thought that the best Athenian regime of his lifetime was not an Athenian democracy (such as Pericles') or an Athenian oligarchy (such as Critias') but one that mixed both elements. Therefore, while certainly a member of the Athenian elite in the sense that he had the time, money, education, and freedom to be able to research and to write the book that he did (which, unfortunately, no slave, daily worker, or woman would have), /u/Iphikrates ignores the historical fact of Thucydides' actual views when implying that he \"represented only the absolute upper crust of society.\" Thucydides represented Thucydides, and his thought seemed to have been quite uncommon among \"the absolute upper crust of society,\" as it was critical of both the democratic and oligarchic factions that made up that upper crust.\n\nMy above remarks are not meant to conclusively prove that certain Athenian authors possessed a genius rare in history. But I do mean them to point to the possibility that they did: that Thucydides, along with the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, Aristophanes, and Sophocles, were able to understand what it means to be a human being according to truth and not only their historical or cultural context, at least to some degree. At the very least, I hope I have shown why calling Thucycides a partisan of Pericles or of the Athenian elite\u2014itself a confusing claim, as I have argued\u2014is not in concord with what he actually wrote. In fact, it's possible, since he gives Sparta an equal hearing to Athens, that he wasn't even a partisan of Athens itself (which does not necessarily mean he was a partisan of Sparta, either).\n\n**III If these men were in fact geniuses, what, if anything, was in the Athenian water?**\n\nBut, to return to the original question. If the possibility I've put forth is true\u2014if it is actually the case that not only Thucydides but also the rest of these thinkers were philosophic geniuses from whom we have much to learn\u2014what was in the Athenian water that enabled so many of them? When it comes to philosophic geniuses, six in about 150 years (Sophocles was born around 500BC; Aristotle died around 322) is a lot, and we may or may not be counting all of them.\n\nPlato himself puts forward an answer\u2014one that is similar to Pericles', as it also identifies Athenian democracy, but in a way that is philosophic, not partisan, and is in fact critical of not only that democracy but simple democracies as such. But, to explain it, I need to quickly overview Plato's view of philosophy. A part of /u/Iphikrates's argument was that we should not understand these thinkers to be philosophic geniuses because they were not able to free themselves from the prejudices of their time and place\u2014of their historical and cultural context and their political class. According to Plato, this argument would be convincing if correct, for such liberation is exactly what philosophy entails.\n\nNow, whether philosophy as so understood is possible for human beings\u2014whether anyone can achieve such liberation\u2014is debated not only among academics but also among philosophers: Freidrich Nietzsche, for example, would deeply question this possibility (see *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, I.15, \"The Thousand and One Goals\"). Yet Plato does see this to be a possibility, although an incredibly difficult one. This is the view of philosophy seen in Plato's cave. The cave is all of those \"contexts\" I just mentioned. But *contexts* is not a Greek word. Plato would call the cave the *polis* or *politeia*, that is, the city or its regime. That is, philosophy is the attempt to transcend one's political opinions\u2014those opinions we all grow up with and that we constantly find ourselves surrounded by\u2014to knowledge as such; to leave the cave of incorrect common opinion to the light of actual truth.\n\nFurthermore, Plato, or at least Plato's Socrates, argues that it is easier to escape the cave in a place like Athens. In Book 8 of the *Republic*, while going through the various types of regimes with Glaucon, Socrates states that the only one in which any philosophic activity occurs is democracy (561d). The argument is one we are all familiar with: a democracy, if it is actually a democracy, is \"full of freedom and free speech\" and \"license...to do whatever one wants\" (557b).\n\nBoth of these things are necessary in order to attempt to philosophize, that is, live a life devoted to challenging the prejudices of oneself and one's city in the pursuit of truth. Now, Socrates, in Plato's dialogues, does not argue that democracy is the *sufficient* condition for philosophy\u2014he famously proclaims in Plato's *Apology* that almost every Athenian (no matter where they fall in terms of political or socioeconomic class) will not be able to believe his claim that \"the unexamined life is not livable for a human being\" (38a5\u20136). But democracy was a part of what these thinkers were drinking, as you say, in order to live the lives they lived and produce the works that they did. This is by no means to deny that Athens' empire and resulting wealth did not help produce these works, nor the social standing of the authors' in question. Yet, I also find that /u/Iphikrates greatly overstates this point, especially the latter one: as I've already noted, Socrates was, quite famously, penniless. And while he did not himself write, he is the reason both Plato and Xenophon (and so, ultimately, Aristotle) did.\n\nThis is also not to say that democracy is even a *necessary* condition for philosophy, or even *Socratic* philosophy: later Socratics, such as Maimonides or Al-Farabi, lived in theocracies. But later Socratics have never been found with the same frequency as Socratics were found back then.\n\nA final note, and proof that, like Thucydides, Plato too disagreed with the the view put forth in Pericles' funeral oration: although democracy may be the regime most conducive to philosophy, Plato has his Socrates disagree with Pericles that this aspect of democracy is proof of the goodness of Athens or even democracy as such. As Socrates soon goes on to assert, democracy eventually leads to tyranny (562b). The freedom and license that allows philosophy to thrive is also, quite unfortunately, the freedom and license that leads to tyranny, for \"a democratic city, once it's thirsted for freedom...gets more drunk than it should on this unmixed draught\" (562d). Yet, again, this does not mean that Plato was an oligarch. Like Thucydides, the regimes he desired human beings to aim at\u2014those given in both the Republic and the Laws\u2014were not simply democratic nor oligarchic but mixed. Furthermore, like Thucydides, Plato is never reported as leading a political faction in Athens.

However, I will put forth one reason why it is quite debatable to classify at least one of these texts\u2014Thucydides' *History* (a title I should note he may not have given himself; the Greek word *historia*, which means inquiry, is found only in its title)\u2014as propaganda akin to Pericles' funeral oration, as /u/Iphikrates implied it to be. While I am now moving toward interpretation, I believe what I am doing to be appropriate for this subreddit for it is *intellectual history* (furthermore, /u/Iphikrates was also interpreting the Funeral Oration, although that post did not treat the text as closely as I will).\n\nNow, first of all, we should be clear about what exactly Pericles' supposed propaganda is. He certainly does not argue that the writing of Plato, Thucydides, Xenophon, or Aristotle is proof of Athens' greatness, as none of those works were written at the time. Yet he also does not simply call philosophy a good thing: while he does claim that Athenians \"philosophize without softness\" (II.40.1), he then goes on to describe someone like Socrates as \"rather useless\" (*id.* 2). Moreover, he does mention the greatness of their festivals  (II.38.1), festivals in which tragic and comic works would be performed, but he calls them good because their \"daily delight drives away what is painful\" (*ibid.*), not because they are necessary for education, as the Alexandrian librarians/theologians thought. /u/Iphikrates is therefore incorrect to identify Pericles as the only source of the opinion that these works are great. The Alexandrian librarians I mentioned above believed them to be great for the education they offer; Pericles is proud of the Athenian tragedians and comedians because of the entertainment they afford. It therefore seems likely that Pericles would *not* have even called the works of Thucydides, Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle great.\n\nThat said, I will turn back to Thucydides. Although I noted above that Thucydides is generally regarded as a historian, it is important to note that calling him such is a scholarly classification that may or may not accord with his work itself. At the very least, if we opened up Thucydides expecting a modern-day history, we would end up quite confused. As Thucydides himself explains (I.22.1\u20134), his work comprises two main parts: accounts of the *deeds* of the war, as well as accounts of the *speeches* of the major players of the war. He claims to follow what we today would call good historical practice for the former:\n\n&gt;But as for the deeds that were done in the war, I have not judged it proper to write them after having learned about them from any chance person, nor as it was in my opinion\u2014but instead, i*n accordance with what I witnessed, and as I heard from others after undertaking as precise as possible an inquiry about each of the matters* (I.22.2; emph. my own)\n\nThere, he sounds like what we would call a good historian today, at least one studying contemporary events: he watches and listens to himself when he can, speaks to others about what happened, and tries to be \"as precise as possible\" about these deeds. Yet, for the speeches, he admits they are of his own creation:\n\n&gt;And with regard to as many things as were uttered in speech by each person, either before going to war or once in it, to remember precisely what was said was difficult for me in the cases when I heard myself, and also for those who brought reports to me from elsewhere; *but as each in my opinion would have spoken what especially ought to have been said concerning the matters of each occasion, thus has it been spoken, sticking as closely as possible to the whole thought of what was truly said.* (I.22.1; emph. my own)\n\nSaid otherwise, Thucydides admits here that the speeches in his book are what he believes \"ought to have been said,\" not what was *actually* said. He does qualify this by saying he stuck \"as closely as possible to the whole thought of what was truly said,\" but this statement is quite ambiguous: \"the whole thought of what was truly said\" is *not* the same as \"what was truly said.\" In any event, no historians today would attempt such a thing: if reporting speeches, they would try to report only what was *actually* said. Because of this, some blame Thucydides for being a bad historian; however, it may be the case that he did not desire to be a historian, at least how we understand historians today.\n\nIn fact, this appears to be the case due to a shocking claim he makes right afterwards:\n\n&gt;It will suffice if they are judged beneficial by as many as will wish to see with clarity the things that have come to pass and that will be in the future, ever again such, or nearly such, in accordance with what is human. And it is a possession for always, rather than a competitive work to be heard at the moment, that has been composed (I.22.4; emph. my own)\n\nThucydides here makes a claim that no modern historian would: he is writing not only about a specific human event but about the human condition as such. He therefore appeared to understand his own work to be not only historic but also *philosophic*, that is, as the attempt to understand the truth about nature and human beings. Whether he was right is, of course, a matter of debate. One can easily call one's own work philosophic without it actually being such.\n\nBut, to return to my point. Thucydides admits that the speeches are his own creation. Therefore, Pericles' Funeral Oration is really a work of Thucydides; it is Thucydides' *Pericles' Funeral Oration.*\n\nNow, I completely agree with /u/Iphikrates that the Funeral Oration is a justification of the Athenian empire by the leading Athenian statesman at the time (II.65.9) for Athenians. Therefore, it certainly risks being only propaganda. But I also see no reason why Thucydides would also not agree. Furthermore, Thucydides, despite being an Athenian (which he himself notes in the first line of the work) does not include only Athenian speeches in his work. As /u/Iphikrates refers to, he also includes the viewpoint of Athens' enemy, Sparta. For example, from I.80\u201384, Thucydides writes a speech by the Spartan king Archidamus which also risks being propaganda because it is a justification of the Spartan way of life by a most highly respected (I.79) Spartan statesman at the time for Spartans.\n\nSo who, then, did Thucydides himself believe? Pericles? Archidamus? Neither? Was Thucydides simply a representative of the Athenian elite or was he able to liberate his own thought from the prejudices of that elite?\n\nThis is a hard question to answer, and it is impossible to know fully without analyzing his entire text. But, first, let me clarify the question. It is debatable that we can even talk about \"the Athenian elite\" as a coherent whole. As Thucydides shows, in the aftermath of Athens' loss at Sicily\u2014the exhibition that led to them losing the war\u2014Athens entered into a time of great political turmoil with many coups, which resulted sometimes in oligarchy and other times in a new democracy. Yet these coups were led by \"the Athenian elite,\" but different members of that elite at different times: some were democratic; others, oligarchic. For example, Socrates is famous for rubbing elbows with much of that elite (although he himself was famously penniless): some of them, such as Critias and Charmides, became members of the 30 Tyrants, while others, such as Charephon, was a loyal member of the democratic faction.\n\n(see Debra Nails' great book, *The People of Plato*).", "edited": 1638044211.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II Were these men geniuses, or is this view only Periclean propaganda?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fully answering this question is impossible in this post because it would require fully analyzing each of these works. However, I will put forth one reason why it is quite debatable to classify at least one of these texts\u2014Thucydides&amp;#39; &lt;em&gt;History&lt;/em&gt; (a title I should note he may not have given himself; the Greek word &lt;em&gt;historia&lt;/em&gt;, which means inquiry, is found only in its title)\u2014as propaganda akin to Pericles&amp;#39; funeral oration, as &lt;a href=\"/u/Iphikrates\"&gt;/u/Iphikrates&lt;/a&gt; implied it to be. While I am now moving toward interpretation, I believe what I am doing to be appropriate for this subreddit for it is &lt;em&gt;intellectual history&lt;/em&gt; (furthermore, &lt;a href=\"/u/Iphikrates\"&gt;/u/Iphikrates&lt;/a&gt; was also interpreting the Funeral Oration, although that post did not treat the text as closely as I will).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, first of all, we should be clear about what exactly Pericles&amp;#39; supposed propaganda is. He certainly does not argue that the writing of Plato, Thucydides, Xenophon, or Aristotle is proof of Athens&amp;#39; greatness, as none of those works were written at the time. Yet he also does not simply call philosophy a good thing: while he does claim that Athenians &amp;quot;philosophize without softness&amp;quot; (II.40.1), he then goes on to describe someone like Socrates as &amp;quot;rather useless&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;id.&lt;/em&gt; 2). Moreover, he does mention the greatness of their festivals  (II.38.1), festivals in which tragic and comic works would be performed, but he calls them good because their &amp;quot;daily delight drives away what is painful&amp;quot; (&lt;em&gt;ibid.&lt;/em&gt;), not because they are necessary for education, as the Alexandrian librarians/theologians thought. &lt;a href=\"/u/Iphikrates\"&gt;/u/Iphikrates&lt;/a&gt; is therefore incorrect to identify Pericles as the only source of the opinion that these works are great. The Alexandrian librarians I mentioned above believed them to be great for the education they offer; Pericles is proud of the Athenian tragedians and comedians because of the entertainment they afford. It therefore seems likely that Pericles would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have even called the works of Thucydides, Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I will turn back to Thucydides. Although I noted above that Thucydides is generally regarded as a historian, it is important to note that calling him such is a scholarly classification that may or may not accord with his work itself. At the very least, if we opened up Thucydides expecting a modern-day history, we would end up quite confused. As Thucydides himself explains (I.22.1\u20134), his work comprises two main parts: accounts of the &lt;em&gt;deeds&lt;/em&gt; of the war, as well as accounts of the &lt;em&gt;speeches&lt;/em&gt; of the major players of the war. He claims to follow what we today would call good historical practice for the former:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But as for the deeds that were done in the war, I have not judged it proper to write them after having learned about them from any chance person, nor as it was in my opinion\u2014but instead, i&lt;em&gt;n accordance with what I witnessed, and as I heard from others after undertaking as precise as possible an inquiry about each of the matters&lt;/em&gt; (I.22.2; emph. my own)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There, he sounds like what we would call a good historian today, at least one studying contemporary events: he watches and listens to himself when he can, speaks to others about what happened, and tries to be &amp;quot;as precise as possible&amp;quot; about these deeds.

Xenophon is harder to so simply categorize, as he wrote what we would call history (such as his *Hellenica*) as well as philosophy (such as his *Memorabilia*).
