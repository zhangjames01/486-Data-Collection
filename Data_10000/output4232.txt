Add the FAQ link about ED too.  Sit down with your SO, not during sex, but at a time when you are both relaxed, and ask her to read through the posts.  This ought to help her see that it is not a reflection on her *at all*, but that her fears *are* understandable.  Hey, it worked for me ;)\n\nSecond step: Explain that you want to try and fix this, together.  Suggest that you don't try to penetrate her, for at least a week or two.  Get sexy together, yes.  Ensure you are both physically AND mentally aroused. Use toys/perform oral/mutually masturbate etc, but do NOT try to penetrate her.  Explain that this just might relieve the mental block you have re: penetration.  It will also allow you to show her your desire for her!\n\nThird step:  After a week or two of fooling around, try some outercourse.  Rub your dick on her labia and clit, rub against her perineum and tease the entrance, then do something else.  Keep in mind \"I'm just playing/teasing, I'm not going to fuck her\" ...
