Sovereign citizen blabbering makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is chiropractic therapy proven helpful? Depends.  If done alongside proper physical therapy it&amp;#39;s absolutely effective at reducing pain, inflammation, and increasing flexibility. Moving joints helps increase blood flow and helps healing after injury.  If it&amp;#39;s done purely in line with chiropractic &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; and all those scam detox treatments and snake oils, it&amp;#39;s likely being practiced by someone who can do MUCH more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in most people do not understand chiropractic care and do not know how to find a proper chiropractor.  The wrong chiropractor CAN SERIOUSLY HURT YOU, and this is where i think all this hate comes from.  A proper chiropractor can greatly improve your life when used alongside proper medical care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null,
