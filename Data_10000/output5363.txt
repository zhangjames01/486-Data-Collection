You must resolve an auto skill that has met its requirements. The order you resolve any pending auto skills is not defined and you can choose any pending skill in any order. The main rule is that you resolve each effect fully/as much as possible before resolving another.\n\nHowever, this simply means you must follow the instructions on the card. If it allows you to pay cost or choose no cards, then you can sort of avoid resolving the rest of the effect. If they give you no options then you must resolve the effect regardless of usefulness/relevancy as long as it is legal to do so. When involving a specific number of something that isn't a cost, you must also choose as many applicable targets as possible and those targets cannot be the same unit.\n\nFor a few examples:\n\n **\\[AUTO\\](VC):When this unit attacks, COST \\[Counter** **Blast (1)****\\], choose up to two of your rear-guards, and return them to your hand.** \n\nYou MUST resolve this auto after it goes into standby (After you declare the attack). However it effectively begins resolving and stops if you choose not to pay cost as you have reached the end. (You resolve it and cannot do anymore as you chose not to pay cost.)\n\nIf you choose to pay cost instead, you may then choose between 0, 1, and 2 rear-guards you control and return them to your hand. You cannot choose the same rear-guard twice. Like stated also, you MAY choose 0 here so you can theoretically pay cb1 to effectively do nothing and that is still legal. Just that this isn't normally something you'd want to do.\n\n **\\[AUTO\\](VC):When this unit attacks, choose up to 1 card in your hand, place it on the bottom of your deck. If you do,draw a card.**\n\nYou MUST resolve this auto after it goes into standby (After you declare the attack). You can choose 0 or 1 cards to put to the bottom of your deck. If you choose 0, then because it states \"If you do\", you do not draw a card in this case. If you put 1 card to bottom of deck however, you do draw a card.\n\n **\\[AUTO\\](VC):When this unit attacks, Soul Charge(1).** \n\nYou MUST resolve this auto after it goes into standby (After you declare the attack). You cannot avoid soul charging when declaring an attack with this card on the vanguard circle. This is mandatory because it does not say \"You may Soul Charge(1)\".\n\n **\\[AUTO\\](VC):When this unit attacks, your opponent chooses two of their rear-guards. You may choose one of the chosen cards, retire it.**\n\nIn this situation, like usual you MUST resolve this auto after it goes into standby. Because it specifies a number and is not an \"Up to\", this forces your opponent to choose as many applicable targets as they can. If they have 3 rearguards, they must choose 2 of them. No more, no less. If they have 2 rearguards, they must choose both of them. If they have 2 rearguards BUT ONE CANNOT BE CHOSEN FOR EFFECTS, then they will only choose 1 rear-guard. If they have 1, they will choose that single rear-guard. With 0, they cannot choose any and so you wouldn't retire anything.\n\nAlso notice the \"You may\" as that also means no matter how many targets were chosen, you can always choose not to retire a card.\n\n**\\[AUTO\\](RC)1/TURN: When this unit attacks, if your vanguard sung a Song this turn, this unit gets \\[Power\\]+5000 until end of turn, then COST \\[****Counter Blast (1) &amp; discard a card from your hand****\\], and draw two cards.**\n\nThis is a special case because 1/TURN effects have a clause that allows you to remove 1/TURN AUTO skills from standby if their activation requirements are met. This means 1/TURN AUTO skills DO NOT HAVE TO BE RESOLVED. This still follows the regular rules and if you choose to resolve it you must resolve as much as possible. No stopping midway in the effect somewhere just because you want to.\n\nSo in this case, if you attack with this rearguard, it will go into standby, however you can choose not to resolve it and it will remain activatable since it hasn't been used. This allows you to more specifically choose when you want to resolve these skills. (For example if it restands later in the turn or something in this card's case.)\n\nKeep in mind that you either gain \\[Power\\]+5000 AND choose to pay the cost to draw 2 cards at the time requirements are met and never again on this turn, or you forego the Power and effect until you meet its requirements again later that turn. You cannot gain power now, and wait till later to use the draw 2 effect.

Because it specifies a number and is not an &amp;quot;Up to&amp;quot;, this forces your opponent to choose as many applicable targets as they can. If they have 3 rearguards, they must choose 2 of them. No more, no less. If they have 2 rearguards, they must choose both of them. If they have 2 rearguards BUT ONE CANNOT BE CHOSEN FOR EFFECTS, then they will only choose 1 rear-guard. If they have 1, they will choose that single rear-guard. With 0, they cannot choose any and so you wouldn&amp;#39;t retire anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also notice the &amp;quot;You may&amp;quot; as that also means no matter how many targets were chosen, you can always choose not to retire a card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[AUTO](RC)1/TURN: When this unit attacks, if your vanguard sung a Song this turn, this unit gets [Power]+5000 until end of turn, then COST [&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter Blast (1) &amp;amp; discard a card from your hand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;], and draw two cards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a special case because 1/TURN effects have a clause that allows you to remove 1/TURN AUTO skills from standby if their activation requirements are met. This means 1/TURN AUTO skills DO NOT HAVE TO BE RESOLVED. This still follows the regular rules and if you choose to resolve it you must resolve as much as possible. No stopping midway in the effect somewhere just because you want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in this case, if you attack with this rearguard, it will go into standby, however you can choose not to resolve it and it will remain activatable since it hasn&amp;#39;t been used. This allows you to more specifically choose when you want to resolve these skills. (For example if it restands later in the turn or something in this card&amp;#39;s case.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that you either gain [Power]+5000 AND choose to pay the cost to draw 2 cards at the time requirements are met and never again on this turn, or you forego the Power and effect until you meet its requirements again later that turn. You cannot gain power now, and wait till later to use the draw 2 effect. It&amp;#39;s everything or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zqpuxf", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/cardfightvanguard/comments/zqpuxf/some_rules_question_that_i_have_and_cant_find/j11bjh1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cardfightvanguard/comments/zqpuxf/some_rules_question_that_i_have_and_cant_find/", "name": "t1_j11bjh1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/cardfightvanguard", "author_flair_text": "Shadow Paladin", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1671577630.0, "created_utc": 1671577630.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cardfightvanguard/comments/zqpuxf/some_rules_question_that_i_have_and_cant_find/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tcbx", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "VG was something I loved before, would like to get back to it again", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 1, "subreddit": "cardfightvanguard", "link_author": "ICE_2", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j012csh", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Fallinwinter", "num_comments": 11, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_zko91n", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_hn62b", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If youre looking for older eras of vanguard.
