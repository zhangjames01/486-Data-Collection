The branch of government we elect.\n\nI'm sure it's just a typo (or perhaps a thinly veiled comment on our false separation of powers), but it's the legislative branch who make laws (Parliament), and the executive branch who enforce them (Ministries/Police/etc). \n\n&gt;Frankly, if the laws are unjust, it\u2019s our fault. We put the people who wrote them there. We\u2019re the only ones that can actually fix them.\n\nI used to think that, but I don't really believe in our democracy anymore. After Gillard was deposed by a narcissist and then we elected a theocratic luddite, a neoliberal fascist, and a neoliberal theocratic fascist for a decade, my faith in Australia and our democracy is dead. Yes, it's better than the American and English systems; no contest. But \"we\" don't really have a say in anything.  \n\nOur education is too poor, consent is manufactured to the point we can't tell what's right or wrong or propaganda, the rich distort our political system so much it's actually nonfunctional, and our representative democracy is so weak that parliamentarians don't have to even pretend to consult their constituents. \n\nTo expand on that last point, MPs don't represent the electorate literally at all; their oath of office and the Constitution don't require it. No, Australian MPs represent the Crown first, themselves second, and their parties third. Citizens don't matter at all, and certainly don't get a seat at the table for deciding what the law is. This is by design: representative democracy is set up specifically to quash political activism and participation.

The branch of government we elect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s just a typo (or perhaps a thinly veiled comment on our false separation of powers), but it&amp;#39;s the legislative branch who make laws (Parliament), and the executive branch who enforce them (Ministries/Police/etc). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly, if the laws are unjust, it\u2019s our fault.
