If he is considering breaking up because of how ugly the acne looks and losing interest then this is one of the nicer ways to say that 100% and you guys don\u2019t even know how old they are and are speculating that this is manipulating behaviour. Sadly it\u2019s not projecting as I never had any issue with my GFs appearance, but I suppose you need a reason for why what I\u2019m saying is wrong instead of coming to terms with how fucked up this thread is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: There are 100% times when lying can be good, but generally, the bigger the lie the worse it is, and if acne is getting to the point where you\u2019re starting to lose interest then you should absolutely voice it. Even if a dress looks ugly then be a decent human being and fucking say it so that your SO feels shitty for 2 minutes instead of the entire evening when someone else tells them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_q30gey", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Accutane/comments/q30gey/deleted_by_user/hfs75j1/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/q30gey/deleted_by_user/", "name": "t1_hfs75j1", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Accutane", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1633644436.0, "created_utc": 1633644436.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/q30gey/deleted_by_user/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ui5x", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[deleted by user]", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": -3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Accutane", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hfrvm9a", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "CrackChowder", "num_comments": 82, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hfruv9k", "score": -3, "author_fullname": "t2_crqhl", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "You\u2019re really good at using words that seem swell without the proper fucking use.
