When my parents had enough, they kicked me out of the house at age 18 with only 2 weeks notice. The problem with living in Vancouver is the living expenses are unreasonably high, so I had to move into a tiny basement suite with this fat girl. She was an utter slob. Dirty dishes were left sitting out for a month and eventually we got a fruit fly infestation. Cooking at home became near impossible and any outside food I brought in I had to eat in my room with the door closed or else I would be swarmed. I had survived off McDonald coupons until my body couldn't handle it anymore. I still can't stand the taste or smell of their food.\n\nWhen I had enough, I moved into another two bedroom basement suite that wasn't much better. The place was in a ghetto-ish area. The guy was a heroin addict living with his high school drop out girlfriend and their newborn. It was what you would expect trailer trash living to be like. I'll always remember her using empty vodka bottles as house decorations. At one point, their friends (another couple) fell on hard times and moved into our basement suite, sleeping on the couch. The guy was clinically insane, claiming his father was the devil and had hallucinations of strangers on the street walking up to him and commented how much he looked like his dad. When I questioned him about it, he told me it was all written in the bible. He also accused his girlfriend of cheating on him. Whenever they had sex and she came, he thought her cum was another dude's sperm and claimed a doctor (another hallucination) told him that semen would remain in the vagina and the penis would act like a plunger. The girl would also cry loudly on the phone, talking to her kid who she lost custody over I think... I wasn't too clear on that. Eventually, the heroin addict left his girlfriend and child for his girlfriend's best friend. He also stole a couple hundred dollars from me, which his ex girlfriend payed me back using her government child support fund. I didn't know where the money had come from at the time, but accepting it has left me feeling like a big bag of shit for doing so. It was around this time I started drinking heavily and getting myself in trouble and fights.\n\nWhen I decided that was enough, I moved into a much nicer but extremely expensive basement suite with the world's biggest douche bag. The guy was some business student who drank cheap, shitty beer, drove a truck, partied late, gay bashed and cheated on his girlfriend in front of me. A real scumbag Steve. The place we lived in was nice but the price left little room for food expenses. I was surviving primarily off of free bread from work and tea. I really got to learn what the meaning of hunger meant.\n\nOf course, I eventually lived in better places with better people, but I had to start at the bottom. My high school friends didn't have to worry about moving out until they were married. They were able to live at home and stockpile money for vacations around the world, whereas the last time I went on a real vacation was when princess Diana died. You could argue that they've seen more of the world than I have, but I've seen more of what life is really like than them.\n\nMoving out at an early age is a gamble. I saw a lot of shit go down at a young age, got into alcohol and drugs pretty heavily and found myself in police handcuffs a few times. I was able to get all the dumb stupid decisions in my life out of the way early so now I can focus on being who I want to be now, rather than learn life lessons at a late age. Despite how shitty it was, you get a feeling of preparedness and future challenges seem less daunting. If I ever find myself with my own kid, I would definitely send him/her out on their own at a young age... I may just not be so reckless about it as my parents were.\n\nNow I'm 27, living outside of Vancouver (don't think I could ever go back) drug and alcohol free, living on my own, working towards creating my own future and making sure I keep a level head. Being kicked out of your house is a minor. Ultimately, the following events after the eviction and how they shape you should be the real focal point.
