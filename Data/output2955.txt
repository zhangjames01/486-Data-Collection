Did that culture not teach simple concepts like commutability or hypocrisy? Or greed?&lt;br/&gt;\nIt seems like any given culture is going to have some concepts you can work from to understand why what they&amp;#39;re doing might be immoral, and if they don&amp;#39;t develop that sense of morality, but have the free agency to do so, then we can still say they possess some blame for their actions.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Free agency is complex, but not subtle. If someone balks from pursuing their own sense of morality, when taught conflicting concepts by culture X (murder is good, freedom exists), then they are engaging in their free agency and can share some of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_22zj5c", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/22zj5c/cmv_you_cannot_judge_the_actions_of_others_if/cgrytmc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/22zj5c/cmv_you_cannot_judge_the_actions_of_others_if/", "name": "t1_cgrytmc", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "author_flair_text": "42\u2206", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1397466998.0, "created_utc": 1397466998.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/22zj5c/cmv_you_cannot_judge_the_actions_of_others_if/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "CMV: Men who date/sleep with multiple women at once are immoral.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 3, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "changemyview", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cgryrc6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "AnxiousPolitics", "num_comments": 54, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cgrsw93", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_bl520", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Do you have a source for your bold sociological statement?
