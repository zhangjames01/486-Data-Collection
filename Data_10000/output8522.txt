This makes it difficult to argue that any particular religious principles should guide our current government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, what little is mentioned in the Declaration of Independence is only barely compatible with Christianity, the religion most people have in mind when making the above argument. The Declaration refers to \u201cNature\u2019s God,\u201d \u201cCreator,\u201d and \u201cDivine Providence.\u201d These are all terms used in the sort of deism which was common among many of those responsible for the American Revolution as well as the philosophers upon whom they relied for support. Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, was himself a deist who was opposed to many traditional Christian doctrines, in particular beliefs about the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10xoapt", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/10xoapt/cmv_liberals_dont_blatantly_criticize_islam_like/j7v92ax/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/10xoapt/cmv_liberals_dont_blatantly_criticize_islam_like/", "name": "t1_j7v92ax", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1675963959.0, "created_utc": 1675963959.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/10xoapt/cmv_liberals_dont_blatantly_criticize_islam_like/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2ti4h", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The prize car at this dying mall is an 18 year old Corvette", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "mildlyinteresting", "link_author": "EyeLike2Watch", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j7gwrs5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "DigiSmackd", "num_comments": 3979, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j7dvky0", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3ursg", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "True true.\n\nAlso, a lot of the promos pitched are targeted - and you need a minimum household income to qualify.
