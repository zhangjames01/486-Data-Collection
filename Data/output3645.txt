I'm 37M, and I'm going through the exact same thing with the genders reversed.  I have been in multiple narcissistic and abusive relationships, and after I started going to therapy and began to learn about narcissistic abuse a strange thing started happening.  As I began to become healthy the world began to appear more sick.  The more healthy boundaries I put up, the more I began living life for myself, the more toxic and hostile a large swath of the people around me began to act.  \n\nDating has been a nightmare, frankly.  Many of the women who want my attention want some form narcissistic supply and other co-dependent favors and situations.  They want me to foot the whole bill, be a crash pad, be their therapist, shower them with praise and affection and are often very quick to cut off everything if they don't get exactly what they want, when they want it.  Many of my \"friends\" ended up being not too different.\n\nThe thing I fear the most is how isolating becoming healthy seems to be heading.
