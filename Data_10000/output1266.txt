At all.  Ever.  If there's kids, that's cool, just as long as they don't really impact how we live our lives.\n  \nAs you can see, guys are (or at least I was) huge idiots.  Of course kids change everything (and even in positive ways!), but we have a way of living in complete denial of this obvious truth for *as long as we can*.  I don't know *why*.  Probably because being a grown-up sucks, what with all the \"responsibility\" and crap like that. \n  \nSo, being idiots, scared idiots, we act like we're oblivious to the crying, screaming babies and yelling wives.  \n   \nYes, were *that* dumb.  We're sorry.\n   \nThe good news is that *it gets better*.  WE get better.  Some of us even blossom into really great dads and husbands.  It's often not a pretty or smooth process since, not to get political on this subject or anything, but the role of men in domestic life has been so trivialized and devalued that we're really not trained in this regard anymore.  Being a \"Dad\" isn't something respectable, isn't something that little boys want be when they grow up anymore.\n    \nHopefully though, you *married* this guy because you saw some kind of potential in him.  Now it's time for you to s'plain his new reality to him.  It sounds like you've made a good start.  Getting him to hold down the fort the other day is  a baby step in the right direction.  So, way to go there.  Just keep doing what you're doing on that front and this *will* work itself out.\n    \nHe'll get there.  Eventually.  Try to keep in mind that he's not doing this maliciously, he's just scared and stupid.  Don't let that slow you down or stay your hand in bringing him to heel - because that *has* to happen, for his own good as well as yours and the baby's.  That shouldn't be too hard.  You probably won't feel too sympathetic until you get some decent sleep.  But once you *do* get some sleep though, hopefully his complete lack of preparedness for this new adventure won't be *quite* so annoying.  Hopefully.\n   \nGood luck.  This, too shall pass.  I promise.  And give it a year or so and that baby'll be so cute and you two will be functioning so well, you'll start thinking about wanting *another* one!\n   \nSeriously though.  It happens.
