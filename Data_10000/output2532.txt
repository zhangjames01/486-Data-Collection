None of these things were interfering with my weight management because it was properly balanced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nowadays on weekends he&amp;#39;s eating the chocolate, the marshmallows, and adding on chips, and candy, and fast food. I just think he should cut back on those extras. If you want fast food don&amp;#39;t get the candy, if you want candy eat a light supper. Maybe don&amp;#39;t buy a 1 lb bag, just get 1/2 lb?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I do consider a month recent. I left it alone for a week or two because indulging once in a while is ok. He&amp;#39;s indulging more and more and it&amp;#39;s hurting both of us. I think that it&amp;#39;s becoming unreasonable, and we argue because he thinks he should just keep buying the same quantities of junk. I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You make it sound like I&amp;#39;m force feeding him salads and screaming at him when he has a bite of chocolate, ffs.
