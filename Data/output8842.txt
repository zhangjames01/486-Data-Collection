For instance, my SO and I are both pen and paper roleplayers, so it&amp;#39;s not a stretch for us to try to understand different perspectives and act out different personalities in a recreational setting.  It translates pretty seamlessly into roleplaying sexually as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I was going to do the maid fantasy with my SO, it would benefit most by understanding the parameters beforehand and knowing what each party wants from the experience.  That way we both get what we need form the play.  I&amp;#39;m a wealthy widower, she&amp;#39;s a proud but submissive girl working her way through college.  I&amp;#39;d prefer to seduce her as if I didn&amp;#39;t know her over the course of the night and get to experience the thrill of the hunt again, and she gets the excitement of having her sexuality pursued again as if by a new partner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to dust, that&amp;#39;s fine.  But the physical interaction and visual stimulus is nothing without the psychological draw for someone like me.  To be fair, though, I get off psychologically more than any other way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_106y46", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskMen/comments/106y46/when_your_lady_dresses_up_maid_school_girl_nurse/c6awore/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/106y46/when_your_lady_dresses_up_maid_school_girl_nurse/", "name": "t1_c6awore", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1348151769.0, "created_utc": 1348151769.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/106y46/when_your_lady_dresses_up_maid_school_girl_nurse/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What do you think about women who go to bars and clubs alone?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 17, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskMen", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c68mmca", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "echofive", "num_comments": 54, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_zxslv", "score": 17, "author_fullname": "t2_6hbha", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;What do you think when you see me alone at the club or a bar?\n\nJackpot.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "male", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What do you think when you see me alone at the club or a bar?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackpot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_zxslv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskMen/comments/zxslv/what_do_you_think_about_women_who_go_to_bars_and/c68mmca/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/zxslv/what_do_you_think_about_women_who_go_to_bars_and/", "name": "t1_c68mmca", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskMen", "author_flair_text": "", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1347738768.0, "created_utc": 1347738768.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/zxslv/what_do_you_think_about_women_who_go_to_bars_and/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s30g", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "I can't find his motivation.
