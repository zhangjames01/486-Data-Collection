We got up the night that he got back from the tournament with his check but it was late (11:00pm) when he got back so there was no way to cash the check until the next morning. We were both already really fucking sick, probably 36 hours into WD when he got home that night, and decided to just sit on my couch and smoke as much weed as possible to try and kill time (and hopefully some of the WD symptoms) until 9:00 the next morning when the bank opened and we could cash the check.\n\nWell it got to be about 5:30 the next morning when we really couldn't fucking take it anymore. We were both writhing in pain and could barely fucking move from the aches and pain. I had my window AC unit in my bedroom blasting, and it was as cold as the arctic in that damn room yet we were still sweating like turkeys in the oven. It was at this point that we remembered that the WalMart about 40 minutes from my house was open 24/7 and has a check cashing area. Fuck yeah it's go time! And we all know that once your brain figures out that your on your way to cop you get this semi burst of energy, and this was the only way we were even able to move at this point.\n\nBut shit, we realized that neither of our cars had enough gas to get there, we were planning on hitting the bank before the gas station because they were right around the corner from my house whereas this damn WalMart was, as far as we were concerned at this point, across the damn country. So I went and stole my roommate's last $10 in his wallet, leaving him a note that said \"MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. BACK EVENTUALLY\" and off we went on our adventure.\n\nAfter what seemed like years of the most painful car ride in recorded history, we got to the WalMart and limped over to the check cashing counter. We must have looked horrible, sweat pouring down our faces and walking like we had sticks up our asses. The lady probably thought we just got done with a long night of gay sex. But whatever, fuck her right? We just want our money. She takes the check and gives it a look, having probably never seen a check from the Delaware State Lottery written out to an individual before. Even though it was typed and had the official seal on it and everything, she had no idea what to do with it and called in the manager. Of course, the manager was equally as incompetent and the first thing she said was that it looked fraudulent. I was getting really antsy and impatient at this point, and started getting uppity with the both of them. The manager lady finally told us she couldn't cash it because she had never seen one of these before.\n\n\"Listen ladies, we drove hundreds of miles to come here to get this check cashed because our dying fucking relatives need every fucking dime of it. My boy here has the fucking trophies from the damn tournament that he won to get this money and I'm about to come back in here with them and beat you over your stupid heads with them if you don't cash this check.\"\n\nOf course I didn't say that. Partially because I didn't want the cops called and partially because I only had enough energy to mutter \"Hrnnnngh\" and walk out.\n\nSo we get back to the car in the parking lot, at this point it's about 7:15, still almost 2 hours until we can go to the bank. So I pull out my phone to try and check google maps for some shady ass check cashing stores in the area. Of course there's shit tons of them, but none of them are open until at least 10:00, so that idea is shot to hell. But wait, there was an Acme about 10 minutes in the other direction!\n\nSo with dwindling energy, and both feeling like our bodies are melting and falling apart at the seams, we start on our way back down the road to the Acme. It was at this point that our favorite morning radio show was starting to come on, and their first topic of discussion? Some celebrity went to rehab for heroin addiction. I can taste the dope drip in my damn mouth at this point and I'm starting to get really pissed off, yelling at my buddy for no reason and punching his dashboard.\n\n\"Dude if you don't get me money and drugs right the fuck now we're not friends anymore!\"\n\nHe laughed the most pitiful, lifeless laugh ever and agreed. We'll stop being friends after this probably because one of us is going to commit suicide. Or homicide. Or both.\n\nAnyway we get to Acme and stumble through the door up to the customer service desk. It doesn't open until 8:00. Fuck, well that's better than 9:00. So he sits down on the bench next to the desk and I make my way to the drink fridge they have at the end of each check out lane. I take 2 water bottles (right in front of the person at the register, thankfully they didn't see me) and bring them back to the bench where my buddy was sitting. I give him his and he downs it like he just walked through the fucking desert and hasn't had a drink in months. I can't even stomach anything at this point, so I walk outside and pour half the bottle on my face, hoping to cool myself down. Of course, every splash of the water fucking hurt, and it didn't really help at all. Now I was just wet and cold instead of hot. So I sit back down on the bench, shivering like I was naked in a blizzard.\n\n8:00 comes and we try to cash the check. Now remember, this was a $1500 dollar check and the store had just opened. It didn't dawn on us until the guy stated they only had a couple hundred in the drawer that there had been zero transactions in that register to this point, and there was no way in fucking hell there was gonna be enough money to cash that massive check. \n\nFUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK\n\nAt this point we gave in. It was already 8:15am. We had done all that driving and all that extra suffering for no reason. We were gonna have to wait for the bank to open at 9:00 now. So we get back in the car, one more time. I make a call to our dealer, I must have sounded like one of those people who had throat cancer and uses that implant to talk. I was almost 2 full days into WD, I hadn't had anything to drink in about that long as well (remembering that I could have drank that water I stole, stupid me)\n\nMe: \"Yo man, can you meet us at the PNC bank in the Withdrawal Shopping Center on I can't fucking move road?\"\n\nDboy: \"I dunno man I ain't got a car and it's early as fuck.\"\n\nMe: \"We got $500 bucks to spend.\"\n\nDboy: \"I'll be there yesterday.\"\n\nMe: \"Wait a little while we need to cash this check when it opens, be here at 9:05\"\n\nI may have paraphrased that from what the real conversation was, but you get the idea.\n\nAnyway we get out of the car, not able to sit in that fucking sweat box of pain any longer. My friend puts the check in his pocket, and at this point we're both laying, yes laying, on the concrete walkway outside of the front door of the bank. I light up my last cigarette and it immediately makes me vomit. And this was the special kind of puke, the kind where you haven't had anything in your stomach for 2 days and so the only thing that comes up is bright yellow bile. It stinks like death and looked like a bunch of mixed up egg yolks. \n\nFinally the bank opens and my buddy comes outside with a giant stack of cash in his hand. The dboy gets there right after that and we do a cheesy white boy junky dance and hop in his car. He hands us a log and we get out, back into our car, and move about 10 parking spots down to the next store over. Fuck it we can't wait till we get back home.\n\nAnd after the longest night and morning of our lives, we finally got good. Fuck that was the best I ever felt, when I got that initial chill down my spine after doing it and my body temperature returned to normal immediately. I leaned the car seat back and sunk into it, wishing I had that cigarette that I puked on or that water bottle I wasted earlier. But fuck it I was good at that point, I could get that shit later.\n\n\"Driver, we're done here.\" And away we went.\n\nTL;DR - I spent a lot of time typing that and I think it was a cool story, so just read it if you're curious haha", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Heroin"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My buddy ended up winning $1500 in a state lottery tournament a few months back. We got up the night that he got back from the tournament with his check but it was late (11:00pm) when he got back so there was no way to cash the check until the next morning. We were both already really fucking sick, probably 36 hours into WD when he got home that night, and decided to just sit on my couch and smoke as much weed as possible to try and kill time (and hopefully some of the WD symptoms) until 9:00 the next morning when the bank opened and we could cash the check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well it got to be about 5:30 the next morning when we really couldn&amp;#39;t fucking take it anymore. We were both writhing in pain and could barely fucking move from the aches and pain. I had my window AC unit in my bedroom blasting, and it was as cold as the arctic in that damn room yet we were still sweating like turkeys in the oven. It was at this point that we remembered that the WalMart about 40 minutes from my house was open 24/7 and has a check cashing area. Fuck yeah it&amp;#39;s go time! And we all know that once your brain figures out that your on your way to cop you get this semi burst of energy, and this was the only way we were even able to move at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But shit, we realized that neither of our cars had enough gas to get there, we were planning on hitting the bank before the gas station because they were right around the corner from my house whereas this damn WalMart was, as far as we were concerned at this point, across the damn country. So I went and stole my roommate&amp;#39;s last $10 in his wallet, leaving him a note that said &amp;quot;MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. BACK EVENTUALLY&amp;quot; and off we went on our adventure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like years of the most painful car ride in recorded history, we got to the WalMart and limped over to the check cashing counter. We must have looked horrible, sweat pouring down our faces and walking like we had sticks up our asses. The lady probably thought we just got done with a long night of gay sex. But whatever, fuck her right? We just want our money. She takes the check and gives it a look, having probably never seen a check from the Delaware State Lottery written out to an individual before.
