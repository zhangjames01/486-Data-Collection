I am more worried they will try to drop my policy instead of helping.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially the house is on land that is slightly sloped, the house is built on a solid slab.  The rear fence is about 30ft from the back of my house, and they are doing construction about 30ft from the fence, so 60ft from my home.  I have a retaining wall in my backyard as their land is higher.  On the days that they are using heavy construction equipment to move earth, it causes new cracks to form in my ceiling and separation on the edges of he ceiling where the crown molding meets. It is not coincidence and I have photos as well as I personally witnessed it occurring.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my biggest concern is that this damage is not just cosmetic, that there is actual settling and/or shifting of the slab that is causing the structure of the house to flex and shift causing the separation. My garage door has even begun having trouble opening and closing, when before they started it was dead quiet.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We dont&amp;#39; have the money to fight this, and were hoping to talk directly with the developer but from the sound of it the developer doesn&amp;#39;t care.
