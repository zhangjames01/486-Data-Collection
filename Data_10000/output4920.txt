If there is a gust factor I will carry extra airspeed equal to 50% of the gust factor: 8G20 winds means a gust factor of 12kts in which case I will carry 6 extra kts of airspeed.\n\nIt seems you are also messing with power a lot more than you probably need to. Again verify procedures in your specific POH but in my airplane I pull power to ~1500-1600rpm once abeam the numbers on downwind (your exact power setting might depend on the winds you're fighting), and I set it **once** + leave it there until I've made the runway, save for any adjustments needed to stay on glide path e.g. there is a lake in the approach path that due to thermals commonly requires a ~100rpm bump when you fly over it.\n\n&gt; My issue is from abeam runway in the downwind sometime when I drop that rpm setting down and give it a second it doesn\u2019t start a decent at all\n\nYou are supposed to push the nose down to establish the descent.  The nose isn't going to drop by itself, you need to establish a new attitude and tell it to start pointing down. The purpose of pulling power and putting in the first notch of flaps is, partly, so that you don't overspeed when you do this.  Obviously don't add flaps til in the white arc, though... set reduced power, slow to white arc, add flaps, *then* push nose down and establish your airspeed. You will find this establishes around 500fpm and you can tweak power slightly to get there if you need to, but try to keep the airspeed constant.\n\nYou should also trim it in as soon as you can.  It's really hard to do everything else right if you're muscling the yoke the whole way down to the runway.\n\n&gt; so I wait a couple more second and lower rpm again and then suddenly I\u2019m loosing over my target 500 ft/m. And thus I begin to fly behind the plane because I\u2019m trying to get my airspeed and decent rate steady.\n\nMight benefit you to spend a little time in practice area and dial the establishment of a stabilized descent from a safe altitude, including trimming it in.  Be mindful of trim stalls on your recovery/climbout/go-around.\n\n&gt; When I come down and reach the runway I cut the power to idle and slowly flare.\n\nDon't cut power to idle, walk it out over a 2 or 3 second count.  If you cut power suddenly you can experience the \"chop and drop\" bounce.  It's also okay to leave a small amount of power in or add a tiny back in if you feel like you need it.\n\n&gt; In my final I maintain straight with rudders and dip wing for any alignment issue or winds. But all in all I feel like with my plane is likes to bounce in air during my decent and can feel difficult to keep a steady angle of attack.\n\nThis is kind of normal tbh, small light airplanes love to bounce around -- doubly so if you are solo vs. with passengers (the heavier an airplane is the more insulated from small bumps it will be).  The key is to average what is happening in your brain and correct for general themes like \"I am drifting left\" while being loose on the controls, letting those bumps happen, and not over controlling against every tiny bump/gust/movement.\n\n**Important disclaimer** I am not a CFI, I am not your CFI, and you should practice all of this with one if you are still a student and probably even if you aren't.  I also do not fly your airplane and so the airspeeds and techniques I posted above may be approved procedures for mine but not yours", "edited": 1677866496.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "ppl", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I fly a PA-28-180, on downwind I fly at 90-95 25 degree of flaps(1900 rpm target), abeam runway 80-85 start of decent (1700 rpm), base 80-85 30 degree of flaps (1600 rpm), final 76-80 full flaps (1500 rpm)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Validate this in your specific POH (I fly a PA-28-181 and its possible there are airspeed differences, I&amp;#39;m not going to try and go look) but I believe you might just be too fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fly my pattern 90kts downwind &amp;gt; 80kts base &amp;gt; 70kts final, reducing to 65kts on short final only if I am flying a short field approach. If there is a gust factor I will carry extra airspeed equal to 50% of the gust factor: 8G20 winds means a gust factor of 12kts in which case I will carry 6 extra kts of airspeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems you are also messing with power a lot more than you probably need to. Again verify procedures in your specific POH but in my airplane I pull power to ~1500-1600rpm once abeam the numbers on downwind (your exact power setting might depend on the winds you&amp;#39;re fighting), and I set it &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt; + leave it there until I&amp;#39;ve made the runway, save for any adjustments needed to stay on glide path e.g. there is a lake in the approach path that due to thermals commonly requires a ~100rpm bump when you fly over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My issue is from abeam runway in the downwind sometime when I drop that rpm setting down and give it a second it doesn\u2019t start a decent at all&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are supposed to push the nose down to establish the descent.  The nose isn&amp;#39;t going to drop by itself, you need to establish a new attitude and tell it to start pointing down. The purpose of pulling power and putting in the first notch of flaps is, partly, so that you don&amp;#39;t overspeed when you do this.  Obviously don&amp;#39;t add flaps til in the white arc, though... set reduced power, slow to white arc, add flaps, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; push nose down and establish your airspeed. You will find this establishes around 500fpm and you can tweak power slightly to get there if you need to, but try to keep the airspeed constant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You should also trim it in as soon as you can.  It&amp;#39;s really hard to do everything else right if you&amp;#39;re muscling the yoke the whole way down to the runway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;so I wait a couple more second and lower rpm again and then suddenly I\u2019m loosing over my target 500 ft/m. And thus I begin to fly behind the plane because I\u2019m trying to get my airspeed and decent rate steady.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Might benefit you to spend a little time in practice area and dial the establishment of a stabilized descent from a safe altitude, including trimming it in.  Be mindful of trim stalls on your recovery/climbout/go-around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I come down and reach the runway I cut the power to idle and slowly flare.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t cut power to idle, walk it out over a 2 or 3 second count.  If you cut power suddenly you can experience the &amp;quot;chop and drop&amp;quot; bounce.  It&amp;#39;s also okay to leave a small amount of power in or add a tiny back in if you feel like you need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my final I maintain straight with rudders and dip wing for any alignment issue or winds. But all in all I feel like with my plane is likes to bounce in air during my decent and can feel difficult to keep a steady angle of attack.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is kind of normal tbh, small light airplanes love to bounce around -- doubly so if you are solo vs. with passengers (the heavier an airplane is the more insulated from small bumps it will be).
