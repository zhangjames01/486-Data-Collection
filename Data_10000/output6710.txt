Rumor used connections with someone higher up at EME to get the title without using an application (at a time where applications were closed no less). When Rumor first got partnered with En Masse, Rumor had nowhere near the requirements to get put into the program either, which considering how the only other person partnered at the time was a much MUCH larger streamer (FromThe70s), I wouldn't be surprised if those same contacts got Rumor into the partnership program back when Closers first launched.\n\nNow before people assume I'm just trying to attack Rumor or deface Rumor's character, I want to state the following: **Despite what Rumor's said and done, I still care about Rumor as a person.** I think Rumor can still improve to be a better person, and a better content creator.

Now it feels like the content has stagnated, as if Rumor just hits the 'start stream' button then pulls up manga and starts reading. Rumor's stream feels more like a second thought to Rumor than Rumor's actual focus. I stopped doing the joint streams because of this, as often I would end up pulling up Rumor's chat and doing Rumor's job of interacting with Rumor's viewers for Rumor.\n\nHonestly, I just hope that this becomes a wake up call for Rumor.

The cooldowns work out so that you can cast Overhead Barrage -&amp;gt; EX Rapid Fire -&amp;gt; Overhead Barrage to use that damage boost twice, and by the time Overhead is off cooldown EX Rapid Fire will be a second behind it.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps explain it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_cerbei", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/closers/comments/cerbei/yuris_module/eu4la2y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/closers/comments/cerbei/yuris_module/", "name": "t1_eu4la2y", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/closers", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1563457139.0, "created_utc": 1563457139.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/closers/comments/cerbei/yuris_module/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_32pz5", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Yuri's module", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "closers", "link_author": "fauzanvox", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eu4kc2i", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SolbaneSuzumiya", "num_comments": 4, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_cerbei", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_jsqjc", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Warden Tindalos is the best mod set for Yuri", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "12", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warden Tindalos is the best mod set for Yuri&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_cerbei", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/closers/comments/cerbei/yuris_module/eu4kc2i/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/closers/comments/cerbei/yuris_module/", "name": "t1_eu4kc2i", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/closers", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1563456401.0, "created_utc": 1563456401.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/closers/comments/cerbei/yuris_module/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_32pz5", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "List of characters that use Hoffman modules?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "closers", "link_author": "XLightThief", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "esssg8l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SolbaneSuzumiya", "num_comments": 2, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_c90mdg", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_jsqjc", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The question of T5 Puri vs Hoffman mods mostly comes down to a mixture of your character choice and what Puri mods you have.

The only forum topic hot enough to warrant this meme is the fact that Bai Winchester is slotted to be released in April, so it's safe to assume that you are a player who wants Bai Winchester to be here. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand how you feel about wanting your character in the game. I'm personally a little pissed about Bai's April release myself, because Bai being put out later means that essentially all content for my main character (Yuri Seo) is going to be put out later as well. The reason for that is because in KR, a lot of major content for Yuri (such as Task Force) is lumped with Violet and Bai, so they're slotted to be put out together.  \n\nHowever, the manner at which the vocal \"pro-Bai\" players have been expressing their opinion is nowhere near acceptable forum behavior. For starters, I've seen an abundance of hypocrisy from the accounts that are \"pro-Bai\", the biggest being that they'll constantly directly insult and berate those who they think oppose their opinion but then if anyone says a single thing at all that can be twisted to seem like an attack back at them, they'll immediately ping the community manager [Bear.Shoes](https://Bear.Shoes) as well as the moderation team, namely Hime and Bunnai. It baffles me how the people who are posting \"pro-Bai\" can sit here and insult those individuals but then turn around and run to them screaming when someone snaps back at them. This kind of behavior is exceptionally immature, and is the main reason why a lot of players are getting fed up with the voiced concerns of the \"pro-Bai\" crowd.  \n\nThe main reason why the moderation team and EME staff \"oppose\" your opinion has nothing to do with what you're saying either. The official forum rules are here [https://forums.enmasse.com/closers/discussion/5/forum-rules-amp-guidelines#latest](https://forums.enmasse.com/closers/discussion/5/forum-rules-amp-guidelines#latest), and the second rule is 'Stay On-Topic'. Part of that rule states, and I quote, \"Keep the discussion focused on the topic on-hand, and do not derail the conversation.\" I can't give you an estimate on the sheer number of forum topics I have seen where someone just brings up literally anything BUT Bai Winchester and the \"pro-Bai\" players come in and immediately make it about Bai Winchester's release. These actions are against the forum rules as I have just shown you, and as such the moderation team/EME staff are simply doing their job by shutting these posts down.  \n\nIf you want my honest opinion on how to make people take the pro-Bai crowd seriously, then do the following:  \n\n1. Make a thread, **ONE** thread, about Bai Winchester's release date.  \n2. Do NOT, under ANY circumstances, derail other threads into a Bai release date discussion.  \n3. Keep your thread about Bai's release date relevant to the topic, and if anyone comes to attack you just take the high road and ignore them. Insulting them back just makes people not take you seriously.  \n4. Stop spam pinging the EME staff and the forum moderators for every little thing. The former have jobs to do and the latter have more to their life than to sit on the forums nonstop.  \n5. In the event that the forum thread does not give the expected result (honestly at this point there's 3 or 4 more updates until Bai's release so I doubt the schedule is going to change much) then SIMPLY ACCEPT THE FACTS INSTEAD OF CONSTANTLY DEMANDING CHANGE. EME is a small company publishing multiple games. Not developing, PUBLISHING. This means that they need to frequently work with the developers (which considering all of their titles come from Korean companies, that means that there's language translation in the mix). What that in turn means is that even if they read a forum post TODAY and it was such a godly post that they wanted to immediately work on bringing Bai Winchester over, it still would be at least a month until she came over. As of right now that would still basically put Bai's release in April.  \n\nSadly I know that this post attempting to help you guys be taken seriously is going to get skimmed over until the fact that I used the word 'immature' is seen, then a swarm of pro-Bai players are going to circlejerk, downvote this post, and insult/berate me, but honestly if that happens all it will do is prove my points.  \n\nHopefully at least a few of the pro-Bai players will take away something from these paragraphs.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "12", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the EME Partners that your &amp;quot;meme&amp;quot; is attacking, allow me to clarify the facts on the claim you&amp;#39;re making:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason why EME staff + Moderators + several EME Partners (RumorGaming included) are &amp;quot;going against your opinion&amp;quot; is not because of WHAT you are saying, but rather HOW you are saying it.

For starters, I&amp;#39;ve seen an abundance of hypocrisy from the accounts that are &amp;quot;pro-Bai&amp;quot;, the biggest being that they&amp;#39;ll constantly directly insult and berate those who they think oppose their opinion but then if anyone says a single thing at all that can be twisted to seem like an attack back at them, they&amp;#39;ll immediately ping the community manager &lt;a href=\"https://Bear.Shoes\"&gt;Bear.Shoes&lt;/a&gt; as well as the moderation team, namely Hime and Bunnai. It baffles me how the people who are posting &amp;quot;pro-Bai&amp;quot; can sit here and insult those individuals but then turn around and run to them screaming when someone snaps back at them. This kind of behavior is exceptionally immature, and is the main reason why a lot of players are getting fed up with the voiced concerns of the &amp;quot;pro-Bai&amp;quot; crowd.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main reason why the moderation team and EME staff &amp;quot;oppose&amp;quot; your opinion has nothing to do with what you&amp;#39;re saying either. The official forum rules are here &lt;a href=\"https://forums.enmasse.com/closers/discussion/5/forum-rules-amp-guidelines#latest\"&gt;https://forums.enmasse.com/closers/discussion/5/forum-rules-amp-guidelines#latest&lt;/a&gt;, and the second rule is &amp;#39;Stay On-Topic&amp;#39;. Part of that rule states, and I quote, &amp;quot;Keep the discussion focused on the topic on-hand, and do not derail the conversation.&amp;quot; I can&amp;#39;t give you an estimate on the sheer number of forum topics I have seen where someone just brings up literally anything BUT Bai Winchester and the &amp;quot;pro-Bai&amp;quot; players come in and immediately make it about Bai Winchester&amp;#39;s release. These actions are against the forum rules as I have just shown you, and as such the moderation team/EME staff are simply doing their job by shutting these posts down.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want my honest opinion on how to make people take the pro-Bai crowd seriously, then do the following:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make a thread, &lt;strong&gt;ONE&lt;/strong&gt; thread, about Bai Winchester&amp;#39;s release date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Do NOT, under ANY circumstances, derail other threads into a Bai release date discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep your thread about Bai&amp;#39;s release date relevant to the topic, and if anyone comes to attack you just take the high road and ignore them. Insulting them back just makes people not take you seriously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stop spam pinging the EME staff and the forum moderators for every little thing. The former have jobs to do and the latter have more to their life than to sit on the forums nonstop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the event that the forum thread does not give the expected result (honestly at this point there&amp;#39;s 3 or 4 more updates until Bai&amp;#39;s release so I doubt the schedule is going to change much) then SIMPLY ACCEPT THE FACTS INSTEAD OF CONSTANTLY DEMANDING CHANGE. EME is a small company publishing multiple games. Not developing, PUBLISHING. This means that they need to frequently work with the developers (which considering all of their titles come from Korean companies, that means that there&amp;#39;s language translation in the mix). What that in turn means is that even if they read a forum post TODAY and it was such a godly post that they wanted to immediately work on bringing Bai Winchester over, it still would be at least a month until she came over. As of right now that would still basically put Bai&amp;#39;s release in April.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly I know that this post attempting to help you guys be taken seriously is going to get skimmed over until the fact that I used the word &amp;#39;immature&amp;#39; is seen, then a swarm of pro-Bai players are going to circlejerk, downvote this post, and insult/berate me, but honestly if that happens all it will do is prove my points.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully at least a few of the pro-Bai players will take away something from these paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_auw8gr", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/closers/comments/auw8gr/state_of_the_game_february_2019_if_you_dont_want/ehbm6yr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/closers/comments/auw8gr/state_of_the_game_february_2019_if_you_dont_want/", "name": "t1_ehbm6yr", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/closers", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1551192426.0, "created_utc": 1551192426.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/hljakjguxui21.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_32pz5", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Do people still play the David \"The Trustworthy\" Lane raid?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "closers", "link_author": "wakuwakuusagi", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ehajtio", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "SolbaneSuzumiya", "num_comments": 9, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_auskbl", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_jsqjc", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Nobody really queues for David anymore.

Whales will minmax every little thing but this level of minmax compared to just solid gear building isn&amp;#39;t a massive damage difference for you to have to overcome.&lt;br/&gt;\n2: The latency should be fine, the only real concern to have is that the game can be sluggish after being launched for hours, but a quick restart fixes that.&lt;br/&gt;\n3: Fatigue system got completely removed around June 2018, which was one of the best things to happen to the game IMO.&lt;br/&gt;\n4: Platinum status is very useful, as elite/platinum status gives +1 entry to almost all of the entry gated dungeons, allowing you to get more of the important resources faster.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have discord, feel free to add me at &amp;#39;Solbane Suzumiya#3163&amp;#39; if you have more questions.
