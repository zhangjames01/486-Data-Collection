This was due to the heavy influence from NTT Docomo who believed that faster speeds were the proper way to attract customers. When Cingular bought out ATT Wireless, the first thing they did was kill 3G. The transition to LTE was originally planned to be much earlier, but was delayed by corporate greed (or stockholder interest depending on your vantage point).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes the major carriers are upgrading to LTE, but the reasons have more to do with getting extra access to your wallet than they have to do with doing it for a benevolent reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is that you can&amp;#39;t yell at someone or claim they don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re talking about when they are, in effect, correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LTE matters a little bit, but the real bottle neck is in the backhaul, NOT the wireless standards. Until Cell Carriers are forced to run DWDM or another high-throughput standard, to support their towers, the issues we experience daily will continue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Cingular Killed 3G when ATT Wireless launched it in 1999. LTE is a begrudging upgrade that&amp;#39;s being instituted at the same time bandwidth caps are coming in (see the pattern yet?).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_p7jcz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/todayilearned/comments/p7jcz/til_text_messages_cost_you_in_some_cases_over/c3nd4z4/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/p7jcz/til_text_messages_cost_you_in_some_cases_over/", "name": "t1_c3nd4z4", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/todayilearned", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1328231614.0, "created_utc": 1328231614.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39490829/ns/business-personal_finance/t/items-ludicrous-markups/#.Typgu_nnN_c"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "TIL text messages cost you, in some cases, over 5000% more than what they cost your provider to send.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "todayilearned", "link_author": "WholeWideWorld", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "c3n8i27", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "Prometheus2k2", "num_comments": 766, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_c3n7v9c", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_42ues", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "This is not true.
