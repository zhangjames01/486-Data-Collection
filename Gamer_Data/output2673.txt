That&amp;#39;s why I like Capcom fighters. They&amp;#39;re colorful and light as air until you make contact then it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;BAM!&amp;quot;. But thanks for the suggestion. I hate 3d fighters but I love tits, so I was giving doa 5 some thought. I just don&amp;#39;t know. I like P4A, but don&amp;#39;t know if blazblue CS has an online scene... If not skull girls I&amp;#39;m thinking MvC origins, but if people are playing mk3 online, I&amp;#39;d rather pick that up n wait for a sale on marvel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1uro78", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Fighters/comments/1uro78/questions_about_a_couple_fighters/cel247y/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1uro78/questions_about_a_couple_fighters/", "name": "t1_cel247y", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Fighters", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1389242240.0, "created_utc": 1389242240.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1uro78/questions_about_a_couple_fighters/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2s5rz", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Questions about a couple fighters", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Fighters", "link_author": "Saltthedead", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cel1yf1", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Saltthedead", "num_comments": 8, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cel1rgn", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_a8sz1", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Thanks man.
