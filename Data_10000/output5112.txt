The larger entity that might oversee or have created this reality is largely apathetic in this case.\n\nGreat points!\n\nFirst, for whom is there suffering? Some organisms experience a variety of affects and conditions, some of which may be trying for the organisms. To negate that richness wholly by the subset possibility or experience of suffering in itself engages in placing upon it undue significance (aside from the development of pleasure-aversion). Humans suffer, create the concept of suffering and may define it as the phenomenology of being-in-the-world in general, and try to spend life justifying that in one way or another. And certainly this includes doctrines present in the new age, that say suffering is a particularly good way for growth and learning to occur. But surely the new age thinkers usually acknowledge a human choice in that matter, that we have available to us collaborative and less painful ways to live and learn we have chosen not to explore. From the rigidity of our habits arise 'necessities' of the 'school of hard knocks' in which we repeat our traumas until we find the resolve to choose another way, which may very well lead to another such loop, but so life goes.\n\nSecond, your understanding and usage of 'random', 'natural', and 'spontaneous' is indicative of a metaphysics allowing for pure, transcendent stochasticity (tinged with a conditioned understanding of nature), which I affirm in part and disagree with in larger swaths. Even said metaphysics may coexist with purpose, optimal or not (your use of 'probably' cannot be true, the matter regarding purpose has to be definite according to how you circularly phrased it in the ensuing clause), since in a picture where there is an intelligence or mute process 'surveying' the whole, the participation of sentient organisms within the event-space necessarily entails the calculus of the matters that come with them. This may be spontaneous *to* and *for* us for a variety of reasons, but does not justify spontaneity as a principle that threatens the existence of sound purpose; that is precisely why modern social thought invoke the radical contingency and novelty of the Event as an unsettling theopolitical force desired to be harnessed and yoked to one's goals. Statistical uncertainty is imbued with and provides purpose within our current rendition of capitalism. Returning to the point, is suffering optimal in any sense of the term implying a certain metric? Not sure and it depends I suppose on the metric, but according to variations of this worldview we can surely lessen it ourselves by not giving ourselves the reason to, and finding ways to experientially and technologically connect with and co-create \"natural\" events.\n\nYou may be trying to vocalize a common sentiment that \"some things such as unexpected tragedies are felt as senseless and terrible, and for me to honor that or take that as basically true, I view it unwarranted or offensive to come up with what I think are facile metaphysical plays to justify that within a scheme which may or may not exist.\" Sure, I respect that, but again that is grounded in an incomplete certainty just like the other side (supported by mountains of evidence psychotherapeutically derived or otherwise, but you likely won't recognize to be 'scientific' evidence and that is fine), and both are valid if contentious ways to explain and cope with reality. When it comes to tortures and gruesome killings in society, we are living in a space of logic allowing for that, so no matter how cosmic others may be implicated, it is asinine to not fully take up responsibility, i.e. the space of possibility granted to us to allow for and 'construct' a different reality. It is really a problem of the weakness of will, or *akrasia*, than it is a metaphysical impossibility or rule dictating that the Earthly life we experience has to be structured in this way and include these specific elements. And speaking from a perspective of psychological reductionism, humans seek the concept of unconditional love and grace as a guiding, experiential heuristic allowing for leaps beyond loops of fear and guilt and a reinforced impotence against an externalized aspect of ourselves whose ever-snowballing agency appears to replace 'God' as a necessary axiom if society is to persist. \n\nThird, to say that our love is a subset of what we intuit to be cosmic or ultimate yet sharing in the common word 'love' means that, as per your analogy of sets, it is something that 'God' shares in and extends to organisms in and through their expression. One does not have to be a vitalist to say, moreover, that the analogical comparison we make with the nature of human 'love' and the pure givenness of the cosmos allowing for all expressions and strife to express themselves in will, is sufficient for some people who do not need to endlessly philosophize to delay their adherence to the intuition behind it. Leibniz, for example, argues that 'God acts physically yet freely' (i.e. efficient cause wed with final cause) and in doing so is not confusing moral and metaphysical perfections. He defines moral perfection as \"really physical perfection with respect to minds: the world must not only be the most admirable machine allowing the greatest amount of reality into existence, but also the best *republic*, i.e. through which minds derive the greatest possible happiness and joy \\[tempered in perfection through notes of sour and bitter\\].\" It is, say, the human task of realizing through *their being,* their limited, fumbling, historically/evolutionarily construed being, that *eros* as the impersonal driving force of the world, the Rgvedan notion of 'sacrifice sacrificing the sacrifice' as pure consumption and self-enjoyment, is one and the same with love as *agape*, or charity toward others. And in this sense 'love' is said to be the phenomenology of truth as the incorrigible mood of moods from which all emerge from and are resolved in (e.g. Augustine).", "edited": 1550997578.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you really think suffering is the most optimal way to learn and grow?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There might very well be a good reason to suffering, but probably, there isn&amp;#39;t an optimal purpose for random acts of harm and suffering due to natural conditions and spontaneous events.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the theme of love in spiritual teachings has merit but clearly the love we experience is at the best a subset of something greater in the larger system - because clearly, God does not share our conception of love.

One does not have to be a vitalist to say, moreover, that the analogical comparison we make with the nature of human &amp;#39;love&amp;#39; and the pure givenness of the cosmos allowing for all expressions and strife to express themselves in will, is sufficient for some people who do not need to endlessly philosophize to delay their adherence to the intuition behind it. Leibniz, for example, argues that &amp;#39;God acts physically yet freely&amp;#39; (i.e. efficient cause wed with final cause) and in doing so is not confusing moral and metaphysical perfections. He defines moral perfection as &amp;quot;really physical perfection with respect to minds: the world must not only be the most admirable machine allowing the greatest amount of reality into existence, but also the best &lt;em&gt;republic&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. through which minds derive the greatest possible happiness and joy [tempered in perfection through notes of sour and bitter].&amp;quot; It is, say, the human task of realizing through &lt;em&gt;their being,&lt;/em&gt; their limited, fumbling, historically/evolutionarily construed being, that &lt;em&gt;eros&lt;/em&gt; as the impersonal driving force of the world, the Rgvedan notion of &amp;#39;sacrifice sacrificing the sacrifice&amp;#39; as pure consumption and self-enjoyment, is one and the same with love as &lt;em&gt;agape&lt;/em&gt;, or charity toward others. And in this sense &amp;#39;love&amp;#39; is said to be the phenomenology of truth as the incorrigible mood of moods from which all emerge from and are resolved in (e.g. Augustine).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_atx1x5", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ChildrenOfTheLight/comments/atx1x5/all_this_talk_of_love_in_new_age_spirituality/eh5ru8q/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenOfTheLight/comments/atx1x5/all_this_talk_of_love_in_new_age_spirituality/", "name": "t1_eh5ru8q", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ChildrenOfTheLight", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1550993433.0, "created_utc": 1550993433.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenOfTheLight/comments/atx1x5/all_this_talk_of_love_in_new_age_spirituality/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c45j", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "All this talk of love in new age spirituality...", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ChildrenOfTheLight", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "eh5ru4b", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "osiriarose", "num_comments": 11, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_eh5rtq7", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_aadk0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "In the particular rendition of physicalist/experientialist idealism of many of these entities yes, that might be expressed in terms of vibration as signatures of expression and identity.

How do you even define \"darkness\" and based on what criteria?\n\n'new age' philosophers such as Selig's Guides do not attempt to justify the presence of structural or conceptual dichotomy, i.e. theodicy, and rather encourages us to face it as a historically contingent manifestation of certain concepts. One may give it an explanatory label, such as the emergence of the mind, or agriculture, or stratification as, say, reifying and adopting as an existential analytic the concept of separation. For some, the presence of separation is merely phenomenological or conceptual, and for others, the binary manifestations signify a certain organization of the universe that is one out of many others, which may be read as a cosmic condemnation of humans for some, a route toward pseudoscientific speculations about good and evil correlated with particles and antiparticles for folks who do that, or offering speculation toward a greater infinitude for the rest of us. This inevitable variety of perspectives thus necessitate any alleged or real gnosticism to express itself as agnostic and pragmatic in the face of others, and it is precisely in this manner that the Guides proceed, especially in the Book of Mastery, which is a lucid work on language-games, logic, and social epistemology. Therefore, dichotomy is the name of the game we play. As conceptual beings, we derive significance out of and reify into value-laden concepts the things we experience in the world. Some of them become archetypal to the extent that unquestioned, common-sense associations come to direct our perceptions, judgments, and further thought utilizing them as frozen variables. \n\nFor instance, Seth asserts that the temporal organization of social life upon a more spontaneous, diachronic rhythm of sleep and activity, instituting the daytime/sun/light with activity, growth, safety, vitality, substance, masculinity, truth, over and against the nighttime/moon/darkness with mystery, danger, what is hidden, femininity, ignorance, has created a destructive complex in the long run which is not inherently true yet socially and biologically enforced. \n\nSo we label predator as good and prey as bad or unfortunate, animal as base or undisciplined or unintelligent, then we, led by the 'laws of death' (Paul in the Romans) which only impose upon us and fail to instill a commons of mutual psychotherpeutic becoming, attribute our resulting violence as intentional maligning, hatred, and an expression of a lived paradigm of fear (best encapsulated by the starting points of any political philosophy) back to the natural world, which, analyzed from that stance, produces the now falsified theory of survival of the fittest (the extent of which is debatable, but I can debate this all day) tying together a presumption into a fact. But insofar as such social facts exist and we live in them, we *do* see violence and things that people may call (and disagree in calling) evil or immoral or unethical. Those concepts do exist, and are given expression. If all expressions are real, and to some extent the 'world' is semiotically organizing, then in that sense good and evil, heaven and hell, etc. seek fulfillment in reality. This semiotics is designated as 'vibration', and this is quasi-scientific but is scientifically feasible, and finds expression in academia, an old school example being Whitehead's concept of vibration as a change and recurrence structuring the physical field, the vibration being simultaneously an experience, a data within the whole, and that which is experienced. Geometrical and functional organizations of vibrations called strains may give rise to 'organisms.' (If you have quips regarding the justification behind the internal-external poles, there are so many better existing reconceptualizations I can hit you up with that do not render the mind-body problem as a roadblock many desire to construe it as.) The reduction of all as being accessible via 'vibration' is often construed in value-judgmental terms, i.e. I'm woke and holy and I vibrate faster than you or a rock, but in itself it justifies that intuition through equalizing all facets of existence within that flat, collective ontology, while also reminding us of the freedom of choice and connection that need not be dominated by a certain strata of being or understanding. (not to mention the growing scientific literature on the subject of a certain codifiability of intention in the material world) We are not better than other organisms, but are simply at the stage in which such freedom is consciously available yet have chosen to create some things and experiences out of that we don't really have to keep on reiterating. \n\nSo, the Guides reason, the system of logic and possibility you work with, conditioned thusly within a societal dynamic that you clearly see is to some extent pathological and tumultuous in part because its speculative attempt at self-reflexivity confronts and perceives a failure condemning it an uncertain duration of survival (Hegel, Keynes, and a very long list of et al), is limited and not the whole of what is available to you by virtue of existing. Modernity is characterized by a self-castigation, a hegemonic, patriarchal, white-supremacist society self-perpetuating those labels while self-sabotaging its attempts to do better. It is therefore a subtle co-dependency driving the logic of our lives the Guides seek to abolish and affirm that yes, it is possible to heal and move forward and claim the future and the new, generating in our daily lives and presence the habitus of a new logic really based upon authentic, intimate surrender to other selves which at once (perhaps paradoxically) nourishes one's own boundaries and aspirations. It is to say that revolutions do not come in a day, the love of one does not negate a world of hatred, but a steadfast individual and social fidelity to this pragmatic optimism achieves the Marxist/Benjaminian vision of the angel of destiny turned away from the back toward the future which we have so far failed to do completely because through our narratives our past habits and decisions are viscerally and mentally recalled and so haunts us into our future. Again, this new world is not univocal or denying of diversity as much as it seeks commonality and peace through the extension of love and understanding, of which we are just now learning to speak the language of. This message you can find literally anywhere else if you are an attentive listener, and I think that does not undermine what the Guides seek to say, many of these entities fully and happily accepting the possibility that what may come forward may be a society negating the possibility of their existence and resulting communion, as long as humanity figures this out for themselves and acts accordingly.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the particular rendition of physicalist/experientialist idealism of many of these entities yes, that might be expressed in terms of vibration as signatures of expression and identity.

For instance, Millenniarianism and Transcendentalism would inform American literature and Romanticism, pragmatist and process philosophy, social praxis in colonized regions and in the working class... and also find modern \"new age\" inheritors (who don't realize this cultural inheritance) in a much more diversified, information-saturated milieu in which we are inherited with the politics of proper recognition and mutual understanding in a landscape of syncretism and mantras which threaten for some to become offensive in their indiscriminate bricolage. That does not discount outright the validity of the ever-simplifying mantras nor discourage the comparative process, e.g. look at the fertile exchange between Afro-Futurism/Pessimism and the Vedic musical and spiritual tradition. Just as the layperson reading the Bible or a textbook on Quantum Field Theory does not necessarily understand everything and may create simplistic or ignorant conclusions, much of the bubble foaming out of the new age discourse is pretty much the same. That is why although Jane Roberts' (Seth) channeled work provides one of the most elaborate and comprehensive theories of action, evolution, and experiential metaphysics of causal-nomological significance within a rich context of cultural analysis, psychoanalysis, and ethics, her work is reduced to the pithy line \"\\~you create your own reality\\~\" which belies, for instance, the Kantian dilemma between spontaneity and order grappled as a practical (in Jane's life) and cosmic generative struggle, or the vast information on fields such as neuroscience and systems biology, many of them independently confirmed since, begging to be experimentalized and break through boundaries in paradigmatic organization. But that does not mean that pithy line invalidates itself, or is meant to be read as blithe or an anti-scientific delusion. Sure, there are concerns since in the topos of neoliberal global society, 'new new social movements' rooted not on genuine communal organization but on human capital and optimism as empty advertisement, upon which New Age entrepreneurship may piggyback, culminates in the 'new age' infiltration of corporate and social life as potentially reinforcing a white/western-hegemonic, biopolitical regime of social control only giving lip service to crucial issues while serving the 'god' of energy and capital. But I think that is part and parcel of a larger ethical and social problematic, and there are alternative paths within 'new age', integral studies, and leftist strains of thought (as well as political theologies) stressing deep ecology, a theophany of multiplicity, and ways of understanding actualizing religious and non-religious aspirations toward the Good (\\~Murdoch's sovereignty of good argument) so that we can achieve true globality and co-existence.\n\nWith that covered, here is my thesis: the New Age exhortation into an era of love and understanding only makes sense as a practice within its metaphysics/soteriology which encourages the view of metaphysics not merely as an instrumentalist operationalization necessary for theory creation and orientation. First, the 'new age' is not a monolith, covering Hindu-inspired meditation movements, channeling circles, vague messages about love and health infiltrating society all the way down to instagram quotes, theosophy and modern interpretations of the occult, wiccans, scientists, scholars and practitioners of biomedicine, and practitioners identifying with their own religion yet extending their practice outside it in collaboration. Neither are religions or social identities and organizations, since all structures are inherently processual and 'alive'. If the 'new age' is such a cross-cutting cleavage, then how have so many people come to believe in notions such as divine love and friendly neighborhood deities? First, even with the general perception of modern disenchantment and alienation, there is nonetheless a privileging of human, individual experience (e.g. William James's Varieties of Religious Experience, Eliade's account of hierophany; psychoanalytic discourse and hermeneutics of skepticism; philology and theories of reflexivity; positivism) in the 20th century and onward into postmodern epistemic uncertainty. Experience of wholeness and connectedness, mystical experience, or the uncanny come to serve as conduit and presence of the extra-ordinary which, being banished from rational discourse and splintered via a plurality of metaphysical paradigms insisting upon the premise of exclusivity, demand a personal search. A hodgepodge of such seekers attempt to find identification within the larger landscape, connected by a thread they could only describe as love as the promise that the phenomenology of love is the truth that forgives and redeems solipsism and crosses over all differences. Accepting this premise, love is something to be continually accomplished in the world, not some deus ex machina sweeping out from the sky and bathing everyone in some opioid straight out of Brave New World.

For instance, Millenniarianism and Transcendentalism would inform American literature and Romanticism, pragmatist and process philosophy, social praxis in colonized regions and in the working class... and also find modern &amp;quot;new age&amp;quot; inheritors (who don&amp;#39;t realize this cultural inheritance) in a much more diversified, information-saturated milieu in which we are inherited with the politics of proper recognition and mutual understanding in a landscape of syncretism and mantras which threaten for some to become offensive in their indiscriminate bricolage.

Question number two: \u201cCould you afford some connective commentary regarding how the perspectives of the following great explicators mesh into the same central truths? Swedenborg; Michael, in Yarbro\u2019s *Messages from Michael*; Seth; Franklin Merrell-Wolff; the Cayce trance testator; Orobindo; Meister Eckhart; anonymous authors; the Bhagavad-Gita; Gautama Buddha; Jesus of Nazareth; Mohammet; Krishna; Babaji; Socrates\u201d\u2014well, that\u2019s a starter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am Latwii. I am aware of your question. My brother, consider your own situation. You exist within a reality in which many claim to have a perception of that which is real, that which is factual, that which is existent, yet many seem to be in contradiction with one another in their description. Would it be true to say that each is wrong or each is right? We would offer then the following commentary for your examination.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Each of those which you have described, including, we might add, the anonymous writers, has been able to perceive with a varying degree of clarity that which exists beyond your realm of confusion, and in their perception have attempted to relay that image to their other selves in such a manner as to reproduce that perception. However, as you are aware, the reproduction of concept into words is quite difficult and often of poor result. We would therefore observe initially that the translation on each of the source\u2019s part has been severely hampered by the inability to translate perception into words. As a further example, we would suggest that one consider the possibility of translating into words a robin\u2019s song so that the reader, upon reading the words, could successfully reproduce the musical notes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The further difficulty arrives at the determination of subsequent readers or translators to correct that which they do not understand or alter that with which they do not agree. This has happened quite frequently in the history of your people, both through accident and intention, for much of your historic religious and philosophical texts have been reproduced a number of times in writing after being handed down on the basis of word of mouth for numbers of years, resulting in quite radical deviations from the original source.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Finally, we would observe that those who perceived the original awareness of that which exists beyond the realm of confusion have themselves often been the recipients of much communication, some of which was distorted intentionally by those who would seek to sincerely follow a path of service to self, therefore, quite literally negating much of that which may have been intended.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;May we answer you further?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Carla:** I think so. I think the question is, \u201cWhat connective commentary could you give regarding the central truths if any, which all of these people are trying to explicate?\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My sister, the central truths are of themselves the connective tissue which unite the perceptions of each listed, for it was their perception of that reality, that awareness of both the Creator and the orderly universe which was created, that sparked the imagination of those listed and inspired each to attempt to communicate their awareness to their other selves.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also a useful &lt;a href=\"http://www.llresearch.org/transcripts/issues/1985/1985_0707.aspx\"&gt;Q&amp;#39;uo channeling&lt;/a&gt; for seekers, when they get bogged down in surface metaphysical details engendered by the cognitive distortions of information that obfuscate the Real: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carla:&lt;/strong&gt; Since everyone seems to be pretty passive tonight, perhaps we\u2019ll make this L2 night.

Swedenborg; Michael, in Yarbro\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Messages from Michael&lt;/em&gt;; Seth; Franklin Merrell-Wolff; the Cayce trance testator; Orobindo; Meister Eckhart; anonymous authors; the Bhagavad-Gita; Gautama Buddha; Jesus of Nazareth; Mohammet; Krishna; Babaji; Socrates\u201d\u2014well, that\u2019s a starter.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am Latwii. I am aware of your question. My brother, consider your own situation. You exist within a reality in which many claim to have a perception of that which is real, that which is factual, that which is existent, yet many seem to be in contradiction with one another in their description. Would it be true to say that each is wrong or each is right? We would offer then the following commentary for your examination.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each of those which you have described, including, we might add, the anonymous writers, has been able to perceive with a varying degree of clarity that which exists beyond your realm of confusion, and in their perception have attempted to relay that image to their other selves in such a manner as to reproduce that perception. However, as you are aware, the reproduction of concept into words is quite difficult and often of poor result. We would therefore observe initially that the translation on each of the source\u2019s part has been severely hampered by the inability to translate perception into words. As a further example, we would suggest that one consider the possibility of translating into words a robin\u2019s song so that the reader, upon reading the words, could successfully reproduce the musical notes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The further difficulty arrives at the determination of subsequent readers or translators to correct that which they do not understand or alter that with which they do not agree. This has happened quite frequently in the history of your people, both through accident and intention, for much of your historic religious and philosophical texts have been reproduced a number of times in writing after being handed down on the basis of word of mouth for numbers of years, resulting in quite radical deviations from the original source.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would observe that those who perceived the original awareness of that which exists beyond the realm of confusion have themselves often been the recipients of much communication, some of which was distorted intentionally by those who would seek to sincerely follow a path of service to self, therefore, quite literally negating much of that which may have been intended.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May we answer you further?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carla:&lt;/strong&gt; I think so. I think the question is, \u201cWhat connective commentary could you give regarding the central truths if any, which all of these people are trying to explicate?\u201d  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister, the central truths are of themselves the connective tissue which unite the perceptions of each listed, for it was their perception of that reality, that awareness of both the Creator and the orderly universe which was created, that sparked the imagination of those listed and inspired each to attempt to communicate their awareness to their other selves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_a1kiz4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/ChildrenOfTheLight/comments/a1kiz4/what_is_god_or_the_source_in_your_point_of_view/ebgv80s/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenOfTheLight/comments/a1kiz4/what_is_god_or_the_source_in_your_point_of_view/", "name": "t1_ebgv80s", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ChildrenOfTheLight", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1544404520.0, "created_utc": 1544404520.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenOfTheLight/comments/a1kiz4/what_is_god_or_the_source_in_your_point_of_view/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_3c45j", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What is God or the Source in your point of view?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "ChildrenOfTheLight", "link_author": "discreteUser", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ebgu3au", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "osiriarose", "num_comments": 20, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ebeq3up", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_aadk0", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I don't know why you're so engrossed/invested in the notion of a transcendent, punishing entity (insofar as it is considered to reach beyond and subsume human agency).

The ego, upon its inception, considers itself alienated from action as it attempts to conceive of action as an object, and thus in a way it is truly alienated, i.e. creates a reality, internal and external, that reinforces this conviction. Within this distortion, this apparent separation, the ego may occupy itself with certain thoughts it would have never had such as the absurd notion of sacrifice, punishing deities, and ontopolitical henotheism (which persists to this day).

This means that you have given yourselves full range so that all probabilities could be explored, and none left out that were physically feasible.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(*Again louder*:) This species gave itself no \"preordained\" taboos.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The infinite ranges possible to human capabilities would be explored - and those who chose that route said, quote: \"We will trust that our creativity will find its own way, and if there are nightmares we will waken from them. We will even learn from them. We will dare to push aside the dimensions of being into those realms in which only the gods have gone before - and through our utter vulnerability to experience, discover the divinity that gives our humanity its meaning. And (*whispering*) through the compassion that we have learned, will we be able to understand the divine errors that gave us the gift of our birth. Souls and molecules each are learning, each are forming realities, each are part of a divinity in which each counterpart has a part to play.\"\n\nLook, when you're doing the stuff your ego enjoys, dedicate the joy you get out of them (and every sorrow, every frustration) to the divine. Treat everyone around you - misfits or one night stands, it matters not - as your divine counterparts. Thank the world for you being able to partake in such experiences. Choose to see the divine in all things, and allow your thoughts and behavior to shift in accordance with the perception. It really is a smooth ride if you allow it to be, and the ego will not be harmed, rather seen and thus transformed in a new light as its purview and experience expand within the loving embrace of the divine.\n\nStop your baloney about 'remaining passive to a higher force', you are part of action, you are part of the force you consider to be higher, you are sovereign in the \"I am\" that you are. Think of surrender as more of getting in touch with another part of yourself which is wiser and unconditionally loving, and riding that flow. Within that flow you'll discover whatever is 'authentic' for you, and it won't necessarily involve punishing or depriving your ego. I know where you're coming from, since I've been in that chapter of my life not long ago, but don't worry. Our desires can and do change with effort and time, with none of the pleasure necessarily diminished. I wouldn't be surprised if months or years down the road, you may no longer be seized with, say, the desire for casual sex. And there is no judgment for causal sex. There is no judgment except in fear, and the guideline is: if you act out of fear, then it's probably not a good idea. Just live, and *allow* anything that is not for the highest good fall away. Don't try to evaluate with your mind what they are, or at least don't overdo it.

Which may be a valid choice, but personally I would find it a dead end and recommend a better focus within your life. I don't have views on the afterlife, because the question implies that I share my hypotheses on a hypothetical.

Perhaps try something else in the meantime, like the Bahir (early text of esoteric Jewish mysticism).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, if you want to get into philosophy, I think for the sake of your time, understanding, and interests it&amp;#39;s best to read a bit of 20th century American philosophy instead of immersing yourself fully, particularly radical empiricism and &lt;a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/\"&gt;pragmatism&lt;/a&gt;. Read books and watch videos about/on William James, John Dewey, C.S. Peirce (especially his theory of firstness/secondness/thirdness, and the semiotic self), G.H. Mead, and A.N. Whitehead. They, so to speak, cut through the bs and lots of stubborn misconceptions within western thought, and are closer to what you may consider esoteric without the mystical element.

Psychic abilities are inherent in the 'natural' capacities of a human being, so they do not confer some ontological distinction/preference towards psychic individuals. Yet talented athletes, artists, intellectuals, etc. are all considered to be \"gifted\", although it is held as well that certain discipline, experiences, and some form of education were necessary for their aptitudes to shine through. Intuitive aptitudes do not converge into some catch-all monolith of abilities, and within the average human existence it is not uncommon for individuals to suddenly discover or make sense of their 'nonprimary' senses. That should've lead you to instead take an empathetic approach to those posters while also helping them avoid succumbing to the reified concept of gift. \n\nYour ossifying binary distinction between gift and skill is just as epistemically incomplete and unjustifiable as what you are objecting against. Neither is your conflation of mental capacity with production. This is the case especially as the current understanding of \"capacity\" and \"inherent vs cultivated\" are vastly restricted by the limitations of the materialist, causal-oriented paradigm, which is not a critique of science itself but of their epistemological models. \n\nMuch of the vast swaths of creativity and talent within individuals are buried underneath; immediate behaviorist, neoliberal categorization of binary category of the \"special\"/not-special (which is a proliferating discourse that is reactionary towards a certain social conception that we have been abusing the term - true to an extent, but this approach perpetuates misconceptions via a flattening and territorialization) that does not acknowledge that internalist frontier is a rash political decision. \n\nRather, a Whiteheadian constructivist approach is better encouraged in this context. Tammet's mind/body/spirit complex constructed a particular being-knowing configuration that allows him to perceive, process, and translate 'datum' in a way the average person allegedly cannot.

Psychic abilities are inherent in the &amp;#39;natural&amp;#39; capacities of a human being, so they do not confer some ontological distinction/preference towards psychic individuals. Yet talented athletes, artists, intellectuals, etc. are all considered to be &amp;quot;gifted&amp;quot;, although it is held as well that certain discipline, experiences, and some form of education were necessary for their aptitudes to shine through. Intuitive aptitudes do not converge into some catch-all monolith of abilities, and within the average human existence it is not uncommon for individuals to suddenly discover or make sense of their &amp;#39;nonprimary&amp;#39; senses. That should&amp;#39;ve lead you to instead take an empathetic approach to those posters while also helping them avoid succumbing to the reified concept of gift. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your ossifying binary distinction between gift and skill is just as epistemically incomplete and unjustifiable as what you are objecting against. Neither is your conflation of mental capacity with production. This is the case especially as the current understanding of &amp;quot;capacity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;inherent vs cultivated&amp;quot; are vastly restricted by the limitations of the materialist, causal-oriented paradigm, which is not a critique of science itself but of their epistemological models. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much of the vast swaths of creativity and talent within individuals are buried underneath; immediate behaviorist, neoliberal categorization of binary category of the &amp;quot;special&amp;quot;/not-special (which is a proliferating discourse that is reactionary towards a certain social conception that we have been abusing the term - true to an extent, but this approach perpetuates misconceptions via a flattening and territorialization) that does not acknowledge that internalist frontier is a rash political decision. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather, a Whiteheadian constructivist approach is better encouraged in this context. Tammet&amp;#39;s mind/body/spirit complex constructed a particular being-knowing configuration that allows him to perceive, process, and translate &amp;#39;datum&amp;#39; in a way the average person allegedly cannot. So is everyone else&amp;#39;s, and lumping them together while claiming Tammet stands out demonstrates a hegemony that ironically also discounts the man. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I know where your intention stems from, but just as semantics spawned the misconception that you had to tear down through this post, so you should beware the same.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, without justification or acknowledgment that what has not helped you has nonetheless helped thousands of people, you assert that meditations, &amp;quot;chakras&amp;quot;, crystals, and cards does not &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; one a medium/psychic.
