Deciding the best course of action is to go home and be with my family I&amp;#39;m moving back next Thursday (Dec.12th) though I believe this to be the right thing to do my anxiety is getting worse and worse as the date approaches....\nIn the midst of all my self sabotage, depression, anxiety and drama I met someone and they&amp;#39;ve since become very dear to me. I get to introduce them to my family for holidays this year, and all the emotions I have mixed up about that coming event is....yeesh, well I wont even get into that right now. \nBut, on the brightside I finished a drawing I&amp;#39;ve been to lazy to finish for about a month now, I get to see my family for the holidays, I also get to spend it with someone very special, I&amp;#39;ve gotten Christmas gifts for the majority of the people that will be celebrating with me, and I get to play my very first Zelda game ever :) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess if you want more details, just ask. I&amp;#39;m in a talkative mood when it comes to basically everything I just posted so....yeah, thanks for letting me share x)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2op99n", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/2op99n/nightly_chathugvent_thread_dec_8th_2014/cmplq1z/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/2op99n/nightly_chathugvent_thread_dec_8th_2014/", "name": "t1_cmplq1z", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon", "author_flair_text": "http://amzn.com/w/3UGWFRF0CA2HL ", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1418117378.0, "created_utc": 1418117378.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/2op99n/nightly_chathugvent_thread_dec_8th_2014/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tx47", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Nightly chat/hug/vent thread Dec 8th, 2014", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Random_Acts_Of_Amazon", "link_author": "ArtsyKitty", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cmplcwb", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "AlyCadaver", "num_comments": 749, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_cmp8mdv", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_azd00", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes x3", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "primeryn", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "http://amzn.com/w/3UGWFRF0CA2HL "}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes x3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_2op99n", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/2op99n/nightly_chathugvent_thread_dec_8th_2014/cmplcwb/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/2op99n/nightly_chathugvent_thread_dec_8th_2014/", "name": "t1_cmplcwb", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon", "author_flair_text": "http://amzn.com/w/3UGWFRF0CA2HL ", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1418115603.0, "created_utc": 1418115603.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/2op99n/nightly_chathugvent_thread_dec_8th_2014/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2tx47", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[Discussion] If you could wish for one small thing right now, what would you wish for?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Random_Acts_Of_Amazon", "link_author": "sweetbeauty", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "cmpl3ya", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "AlyCadaver", "num_comments": 116, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_2oq2ob", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_azd00", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "To be able to cuddle up and relax for night for the first time with my lovely boyfriend x/ We live separately and he used to sleep on a couch but has recently moved and has a bed now.
