I play with a duo in Discord, and I will often chat a bit in pre-lobby or post-lobby. I also try to use pings as much as possible and play off the pings my teammates are giving me. In that sense, I'm working with other players towards a common goal which still gives me some of that multiplayer feeling.\n\nI'm also not that bothered by the feeling that I'm playing with or against bots. I enjoy the mechanics of the game, and still even play a vs AI game from time to time with my friends who don't play much.\n\nAt the end of the day it's a tradeoff. I don't do this in most multiplayer games but League has been particularly problematic for me. It seems like all the useful information I get comes from pings (which I don't mute until somebody gives me the enemy missing 20 times in a row) but the chat always seemed to be used to tell me or others how trash they were.\n\nIt comes down to a personal issue. I've suffered from and work with a non-profit for people who suffer from mental illness, specifically depression and suicidal ideation. The feeling of being a worthless person, or complete trash, or like I should kill myself are difficult for me to deal with and to see others deal with. A significant portion of the chat that I see (maybe specific to my elo, which is quite low) are comments along these lines. The idea that a person's value is tied to their ability to play League is destructive in my opinion, and to see open directives to \"KYS\" or that a player is \"human garbage\" because they didn't gank a lane is something that has a greater impact on me than the positive feelings of working together with a teammate who says something nice in chat.\n\nSome folks will tell me I shouldn't play if I \"can't handle it\" and I disagree with that argument. Just because I find it difficult to deal with those feelings doesn't mean I don't deserve to play the game. I know you haven't made that argument but I'd like to get out ahead of it. I mostly play ARAM anyway, but I think everybody has a right to play this game regardless of skill level or the thickness of their skin. It's not against the rules to not be good, as long as you're trying to win.\n\nThe problem here is that by the time I know they're toxic and can mute, the damage is done. Those words will rattle in my head far beyond that game, and that tradeoff is not worth it for me.\n\nIt's worth noting that League is the only game I full muteall in, though there's other online games such as Rocket League where I sometimes limit it to quick chat only. Games like Hearthstone somebody can give me a hard time, but that's pretty manageable. I really appreciate Blizzard's approach here, allowing for some positive interactions while rounding out the corners on negative ones. While I do miss out on some really awesome interactions, it's a calculation in each game I play. In League's case I feel like I can still communicate strategically without it, and if somebody wants to say something nice I usually catch them in post-game chat.\n\nI hope this sheds some light on my perspective.
