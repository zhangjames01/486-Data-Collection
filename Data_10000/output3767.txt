picture of why it's bad. So I'm not sure it helps except for to highlight evidence that change is needed and to promote that change.

Anyways.\n\nOriginal comment below:\n\nHe's kinda wrong.\n\nThe term can be misused to imply that *any man* trying to explain anything at all regardless of context, is wrong and engaging in sexism.\n\nBut I think the term points out a pattern of speech dynamics and social dynamics. One that's worth a second or third thought.\n\nMen are listened to more often, or assumed to be authorities and thus \"obviously it makes sense to listen to this guy so yeah I'm listening to him.\" Women on the other hand are more likely to be not taken seriously and are ignored or treated dismissively when they have a controversial opinion, and I think it happens worse in male-dominated fields or roles.\n\nIn conflicts between a man and a woman, (especially in a male-dominated social context) a man can often ignore a woman's opinion, or dismiss it, and simply explain his view at her and this can be seen as him winning the argument. Whereas if a woman wanted to be so bold as to do this, she would possibly be accused of being unempathetic, not knowing what she's talking about, and subject to character attacks (especially dismissive name-calling such as wh*re, c*** b*tch etc. Just anything to totally dismiss and discredit.)\n\n(Not always. How often it happens on a gendered basis is sort of subjective, but I trust the many women who have complained about this that it happens more to them than how often men are called dicks, or rude or out of line for saying their opinion. The difference is that women are called out for speaking up more than men.)\n\nWhen this word \"mansplaining\" is used properly, it invites us to get used to listening to women, and not letting men speak over women who happen to have the more substantial thing to add. And it invites us to explicitly call out anyone rudely dismissing women who try to speak in a mixed gender group.\n\nAnd to wrap up, you either notice this happening in the real world, or you don't. Or some might see it as a normal part of gender roles, but I think that's fucked up and doesn't lead to healthy social life for men or for women. When people (men women and non-binary people etc basically everybody) can't speak and be heard for the merits of their contribution, you may miss opportunities to advance as a whole group, you may undervalue your star players, or you may be held back in a pattern of bad practices/behavior because you didn't listen to the dissenting opinion.\n\nYeah I found the word grating at first, but the concept is subtle and hard to explain. Having a one-word-long label for it is maybe the only way to get people to talk about it. I do see that as a trade off, and maybe people should lean toward the longer version.
