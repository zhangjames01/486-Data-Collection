It's all well and good to say \"everyone can be queer if they feel different!\", but what can happen is you end up in a group where lgbt (and other currently-accepted-as-queer people) feel left out because so much of what's discussed and advocated for does not represent them and their needs. \n\nThat is not to say you should pivot completely in the other direction and be extremely exclusionary though - there *is* a lot of value in having a diverse set of viewpoints, and intersectionality between different identities can have both huge effects on people's experiences and offer great insight beyond that. A desire for too much purity can push people out who would otherwise accurately be represented and benefit from the group. There's a fuzzy line to draw, and it's often very personal in a way that makes it difficult to draw hard limits.

What if that man isn't in the relationship anymore and otherwise has only been interested in women? What about a man in a relationship with an extremely masc presenting woman? What about a man who is not normally interested in other men, but whose afab partner has recently transitioned?

Ideally you'd be able to keep any fighting you do limited to a few choke points or directions, without having to fight many opponents at once. \n\nA very powerful tool for this is the 10 years of enforced peace you get after ending a war. As long as you can get wars to end within around 10 years time you can often just ping pong between enemies, fighting one for 10 years and then switching to the other one for the next 10 years, with the enforced truce keeping them from ever being able to fight at the same time. For this it can be helpful to start new wars right as your current wars are ending, in order to get war weariness going quickly so you can end the war in time for the next. From the other angle, you can also keep wars going even after the enemy is at 100% war weariness for as long as they're not a considerable threat, holding the status quo until they become a threat or you have need of your fleets/armies elsewhere.\n\nAnother tool you can use is to shop around when looking for war targets. The empire you want to fight might have defensive pacts, vassals, or other allies, but you might be able to find a different empire with less friends who will pull your primary target into the war anyway. Sometimes you can find random empires on the other side of the map who can't reasonably reach you that you can declare war on while pulling in the enemies you actually want to fight without a bunch of other friends joining them along the way. \n\nOne more thing to think about is buffer states. Sometimes it's better to leave another empire alive just so that they'll sit between you and another enemy with closed borders for both of you. You obviously have to be careful, since the empire you're using as a blocker could be subjugated, but you can mitigate that by finding someone already subjugated or who is already an overlord. Having a wall state between you and another enemy can sometimes completely nullify that enemy's ability to fight you, or if not then it often pushes them into more manageable choke points or pressures them into using jump drives. This also works out very well with the previous strategy of shopping around, because you might be able to find enemies who are completely blocked off from you who will pull neighbors you want to fight into a war if you declare on them. \n\nFinally, it also just helps if you can try and be aware of what else is going on in the galaxy. If you know when wars between the AIs are going on you can use that knowledge to have better war timing. You can use a big war as a distraction to pick off unaligned empires without getting war declared on you, or you can try to hit an opponent after they're already weakened by a war they just fought. \n\nAll together it's just really valuable to control how many and what empires you're at war with. Ping pong between enemies to abuse the 10 years of enforced truce, look for fringe enemies who will pull your intended target into war without the rest of their friends, put barriers between you and other enemies, and take advantage of other empires being weakened or distracted by unrelated wars.

No matter what you played there was some chance of the cards being relevant to you, so there was excitement in looking at what was coming out. The fewer sets that weren't designed for standard tended to be rarer and more unique as a result, so they had their own appeal even for formats you weren't interested in playing. \n\nNow? There is *always* something being spoiled, and much of the time it's a specialty product that only matters for a subset of players. Commander sets, un-sets, crossover sets, collector sets, modern sets, pioneer sets, secret lairs, jump-start, there's so much out there that you can never assume whether a new release even matters for you.

Before Arena it used to be that every magic card released into the same space, and even if it wasn't relevant to any formats you played it could still be used alongside every other card *somewhere* and at worst could be traded away. Now there is a clear divide between cards released onto Arena and cards that aren't. This is not an indictment of Arena - it's a great program and makes playing the game much more available and is a ton of fun - but it does mean that for someone who primarily plays arena (like me), it means that any product not available on arena doesn't mean much to me. When I see a spoiler for a paper-only commander set I don't look at the cards and try to get excited or think about how maybe I could try them out, I just glance over them because I know they can't matter to me. \n\nRight now I should be excited about Brother's War, since it's the new standard set coming out. It's a chance for me to get back into Arena and do a bunch of drafts and try out a new standard format. But I've already been seeing spoilers for Warhammer, and several secret lairs, and magic's anniversary product, and jump-start, and the Brother's War commander content, and the retro frame artifacts, and some alchemy rebalancing, and transformers crossover cards, it's just overwhelming and all of this is only in the last two months. I can barely pay attention to Brother's War because whenever I look there's always something else that I probably don't care about going on. \n\nHaving so many different products releasing all the time just makes it hard for anything to stand out, and hard for players to really care about anything. It also means that people are conditioned to look at new Magic content and immediately dismiss it until it proves relevant, since actually trying to keep up with everything is too overwhelming. \n\n(Also as a semi-related rant: There is *way* too much commander product out there. There is supplementary commander product, there's commander versions of regular sets, and huge chunks of the standard sets are just commander bait that don't make sense outside of the format. If you're going to commit so much to having commander specific sets then please quarantine that stuff out of the main sets. I don't want another 10-card cycle of legendary creatures that only kind of make sense outside of commander followed by another mythic cycle of over-expensive cards that don't do anything outside of the most casual commander tables. You have *so many* commander sets, please use them and not standard sets!
