It seems really great on the subject&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Devil&amp;#39;s advocate - spin up a TrueNAS VM with your storage disks passed through, use that for your ZFS and shared storage and &amp;quot;try before you buy&amp;quot; the interface to spin up VMs and containers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The benefits of this: you can give TrueNAS Scale a nice, small virtual boot drive so you don&amp;#39;t waste disk or SATA. You can retain the ease of Proxmox VM/CT creation.
