You&amp;#39;d think &lt;a href=\"/r/games\"&gt;r/games&lt;/a&gt;, a place specifically created to get away from the PC circlejerking and stupidity of &lt;a href=\"/r/gaming\"&gt;r/gaming&lt;/a&gt; would be better than this, but I suppose expecting any modicum of maturity and rational thinking from the gaming demographic was a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just like Dark Souls all over again. When it was console exclusive, most PC gamers turned their nose at it, calling it a &amp;quot;shitty japanese game with false difficulty&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;an ugly rpg that could never compare to Skyrim or The Witcher.&amp;quot; Fast forward a few years later and it&amp;#39;s on PC, and all of a sudden it&amp;#39;s being called one of the finest gaming experiences ever developed in this generation (which is is, to be fair).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_1ppk8a", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Games/comments/1ppk8a/destiny_devs_say_dont_expect_a_pc_version_anytime/cd5a9r7/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ppk8a/destiny_devs_say_dont_expect_a_pc_version_anytime/", "name": "t1_cd5a9r7", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Games", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1383424080.0, "created_utc": 1383424080.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/31/destiny-devs-talk-space-travel-pc-and-microtransactions"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhwp", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Good games that actually have /bad/ soundtracks?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 5, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Games", "link_author": "tytbone", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "ccvtze5", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "CommanderAnaximander", "num_comments": 443, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_ccvr1zc", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_5b6tb", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt;
