Between them, goons, b2/3, frat, and panfam control everything in nullsec except the southeast and south, so if neither side backs down this should be a good one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11iz2vv", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Eve/comments/11iz2vv/so_can_someone_give_me_a_rundown_on_whats_going_on/jb0q1lo/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/11iz2vv/so_can_someone_give_me_a_rundown_on_whats_going_on/", "name": "t1_jb0q1lo", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Eve", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678030232.0, "created_utc": 1678030232.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [{"giver_coin_reward": null, "subreddit_id": null, "is_new": false, "days_of_drip_extension": null, "coin_price": 500, "id": "award_43c43a35-15c5-4f73-91ef-fe538426435a", "penny_donate": null, "award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "coin_reward": 100, "icon_url": "https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/xe5mw55w5v541_BlessUp.png", "days_of_premium": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null, "resized_icons": [{"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/xe5mw55w5v541_BlessUp.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=86ea90c91e68c8416d6535a03a0de560844da977", "width": 16, "height": 16}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/xe5mw55w5v541_BlessUp.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=80e4a5323c68ea1f3a927f679f921fd66f198958", "width": 32, "height": 32}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/xe5mw55w5v541_BlessUp.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e895b89e2b8384d6cfd3a0545b8c48025065103d", "width": 48, "height": 48}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/xe5mw55w5v541_BlessUp.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ef1c7b73aa1d536a2aaeda16ab3134119ca5bb9d", "width": 64, "height": 64}, {"url": "https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/xe5mw55w5v541_BlessUp.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b55a46a50135f11519922e4fb2ee9b6d04918b34", "width": 128, "height": 128}], "icon_width": 2048, "static_icon_width": 2048, "start_date": null, "is_enabled": true, "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "description": "Prayers up for the blessed.

They constitute the majority of the surviving anti-goon side in that war, having absorbed a good chunk of the pilots from entities on that side that have since died off (notably test).\n\nThe imperium has rebounded after that war and resecured their core territory in the southwest (imperium proper) and west (init), along with having a bit of imperium-controlled buffer regions in the south.\n\nThe southeast has until recently been mostly under the control of the loosely-affiliated FIRE coalition, but they got jointly kicked out by init and panfam. Depending on who you ask that happened because their leadership pissed off the wrong people or because the big blocs want more territory. Imperium/panfam/frat have made a joint declaration that the southeast will be left open for small entities without interference from the blocs; whether that's sincere or not is another question whose answer will vary depending on who you ask.\n\nFinally, this brings us to the northwest, the theater for this war. This area has been inhabited by several smaller groups, including volta, blob, brave, and a few others. Notably, several of those settled here after getting kicked out of the north by frat.

Depending on who you ask that happened because their leadership pissed off the wrong people or because the big blocs want more territory.

Missiles have a velocity and a flight time, which means they move a certain number of km each tick for a certain number of ticks. If you laid all of those movement ticks out end to end, you'll get a certain number of km which is your 'range'. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you will hit every target that is within that range or miss every target that is not, because both the targets and your missiles are moving physics objects rather than instantaneous rays like gun shots.\n\nFirst, though I don't think that's what's happening here, some missiles will have a flight time that is not an integer number of ticks. For example, unbonused light missiles have, at max skills, a 7.5s flight time. But missiles are physics objects, and therefore move bound to the 1s server ticks. They can't fly for half a second. So what the game does is take that 7.5s flight time, and make your missiles have a 50% chance to fly for 7 seconds and 50% chance to fly for 8 seconds. So with those light missiles half of your volleys will fly 5625 m/s \\* 7s = 39.375 km, and the other half of your volleys will fly 5625 m/s \\* 8s = 45.0 km, even though the 'paper' range displays 5625 m/s \\* 7.5s = 42.188 km. This means that you'll lose half of your volleys against anything over 39 km away even though your paper range is 42 km, though as partial recompense you'll still get half your volleys against anything up to 45 km away. I don't think this is your problem because rockets have an integer flight time of 3s, but it's one way that missile ranges can be misleading.\n\nThe other problem is that targets move, so unless the target is flying directly towards or away from you the missile won't be flying in a straight line. Rather, it will curve to follow the target's path, and the faster the target is compared to the missile the more curved of a path the missile is going to end up following. So even if the target is orbiting you within the missile's theoretical max range, if they're fast enough the missile will end up taking a curved enough path as it tries to follow the target that it doesn't catch up to the target before expiring. (If the target is *faster* than the missile, the missile won't ever catch them at all even if it could fly forever!)\n\nTargets moving also means that the distance can change while the missile is in flight if they *are* flying towards or away from you. This can mean that a target that *was* in range when you fired the missile can move out of range before the missile gets there if the target is flying away, or conversely if the target is flying towards you they can come *into* the range of a missile that was fired while they were still theoretically out of range.\n\nMy suspicion is that the rats you're fighting have different speeds.

If an *assault frigate* is so cripplingly overspecialized that the only role it can viably fill is one where it removes all of the guns, something is drastically wrong. If it were meant as a pure tackle ship, it'd be a fleet interceptor and wouldn't have a bunch of missile hardpoints and 3 out of 4 of its bonuses being for missiles. This isn't even an argument. \n\nI'm not *opposed* to it being good at tackling. That is a fine thing for an assault frigate to be good at. But it by no means should be the *only* thing it's good at. Nobody can look at the current state of balance for this ship and say it's good. Period.\n\nAnd CCP has already signaled that they consider the ramjag's power to be problematic, so it's not me you'd have to convince here. That's why I'm giving the suggestions I am, because CCP have already indicated that they won't give the ship a reasonable level of power unless there's something about it that nerfs it in that role. Based on CCP's previous statements and actions, the choices here are either to leave the ship in its current hideously broken state, or rebalance it in a way that makes it more viable overall but shifts power away from the ramjag role. That's it. (And it would *still* be a reasonably good tackle ship.)

If an &lt;em&gt;assault frigate&lt;/em&gt; is so cripplingly overspecialized that the only role it can viably fill is one where it removes all of the guns, something is drastically wrong. If it were meant as a pure tackle ship, it&amp;#39;d be a fleet interceptor and wouldn&amp;#39;t have a bunch of missile hardpoints and 3 out of 4 of its bonuses being for missiles. This isn&amp;#39;t even an argument. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not &lt;em&gt;opposed&lt;/em&gt; to it being good at tackling. That is a fine thing for an assault frigate to be good at. But it by no means should be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing it&amp;#39;s good at. Nobody can look at the current state of balance for this ship and say it&amp;#39;s good. Period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And CCP has already signaled that they consider the ramjag&amp;#39;s power to be problematic, so it&amp;#39;s not me you&amp;#39;d have to convince here. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m giving the suggestions I am, because CCP have already indicated that they won&amp;#39;t give the ship a reasonable level of power unless there&amp;#39;s something about it that nerfs it in that role.
