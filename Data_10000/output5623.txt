Some headphones are more accurate than others. e.g. the tygrs are very good at this (but many headphones are).  \n\\* Soundstage: how big your environment seems to be (how far away a sound can get \"out\" of your head). If the soundstage is bigger, it means you have the ability to judge distances better because there are steps in between very far away and very close by. If you have a closed back headphone every sound feels so cramped together that it makes that hard sometimes. However, I have come to the conclusion that bigger is not always better. The most important thing is simply being able to judge distances, because that allows you to ignore sounds that are no threat to you. While the 560s has the smallest soundstage on your list, but that is not a negative / more of a preference as long as you can tell distances (and it's not too small).\n\n* Separation/Layering: When a lot of stuff is going on, you still want to be able to pick out details that are important to you: Just because someone is shooting, you should still be able to hear someone reloading beside you, or footsteps approaching. You want to be able to \"zoom in\" on what you want to hear. It's similar to when you talk to someone while everyone else around you is also talking, but you are able to \"separate\" their voice and concentrate on that only. At any point you can stop listening to them and listen to everything else again. As I said, the 560s were much better at this than any headphone I tried (990, Tygr, A40s). All the others are not bad at this at all, you can still focus on 2-3 things, with the 560s its more like 5 things.  \n\n\nI would say imaging is the most important in any FPS game.

Some headphones are more accurate than others. e.g. the tygrs are very good at this (but many headphones are).&lt;br/&gt;\n* Soundstage: how big your environment seems to be (how far away a sound can get &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; of your head). If the soundstage is bigger, it means you have the ability to judge distances better because there are steps in between very far away and very close by. If you have a closed back headphone every sound feels so cramped together that it makes that hard sometimes. However, I have come to the conclusion that bigger is not always better. The most important thing is simply being able to judge distances, because that allows you to ignore sounds that are no threat to you. While the 560s has the smallest soundstage on your list, but that is not a negative / more of a preference as long as you can tell distances (and it&amp;#39;s not too small).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Separation/Layering: When a lot of stuff is going on, you still want to be able to pick out details that are important to you: Just because someone is shooting, you should still be able to hear someone reloading beside you, or footsteps approaching.
