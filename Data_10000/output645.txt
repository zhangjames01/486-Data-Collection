They make peppermint sprays specifically for shoes.\n\nThis one was so counter-intuitive to me but it made a huge difference: thicker socks. I always wore thin, cheap socks and it was like not wearing any at all, I guess. Let all the sweat and dead skin cells through to the shoe.

If they get wet, if they get excessively dirty, etc.\n\nWash your feet well. Letting the soapy shower water hit them is not enough. Scrub them a bit with soap. And then be sure that you thoroughly dry them after your shower and never put already damp feet into your socks and shoes.\n\nIf your shoes already smell...\n\nThis is a bit trickier and I have found that sometimes you'll just never completely get rid of the smell, but you can minimize it.\n\nFreezing the shoes was a suggestion I found that didn't seem to do a whole lot for me. Maybe my freezer wasn't cold enough, maybe I didn't leave them in long enough (overnight), etc. Idk. It could be worth a shot still. I think it helped marginally and even that was a blessing at that point. Put the shoes in a plastic bag before putting in your freezer so you don't get shoe all over everything.\n\nAgain, if your shoes are washable: put them in a wash basin or a bathtub filled with water and plenty of baking soda. Let them soak for at least 24 hours. Then run them through the washing machine on a rinse cycle with nothing added to the machine. Then once that cycle is done, let your washer fill with water and add some distilled white vinegar. Let that sit for about half an hour to an hour. Run another rinse cycle, nothing added. Then run one last cycle with your normal detergent - just a bit of it. Run the full wash cycle, not just the rinse. Then into the dryer if possible. If not, air dry in the sun, in front of a fireplace, in front of a space heater, etc. You don't want them to sit wet longer than they have to.\n\nIf you're dealing with boots or shoes that can't be washed... smell reduction is about all you're gonna get, I'm afraid. This is where I'd definitely try the freezer anyway because anything helps. Keep em in a while. Then I put a baggie filled with a bit of baking soda in each shoe and let it sit as long as possible, changing out the soda every 12 hours or so. Then a small spritz of peppermint spray before putting your shoes on and a couple of good sprays when you take them off for the day. \n\nBoots especially you don't want to wear every day if you can help it. If you have no choice, wear thick socks, spray with peppermint, and put baking soda in every night. And wear for the shortest amount of time possible each day.

You need to be able to see if water is being discharged from it. The TPR valve is your only visual indicator that pressure is building too high in your tank and your only safeguard against the tank blowing up if pressure does build. The standard is that the TPR valve should discharge roughly 6&amp;quot; from the floor or, if into a floor drain, there should be an air gap so you can see if water comes out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_tk1qr3", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Plumbing/comments/tk1qr3/help_why_is_my_hot_water_like_this_not_always_and/i20yj12/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/comments/tk1qr3/help_why_is_my_hot_water_like_this_not_always_and/", "name": "t1_i20yj12", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Plumbing", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1648182066.0, "created_utc": 1648182066.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/43jh75e3hxo81.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w844", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "[deleted by user]", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "i20426y", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "cn2092", "num_comments": 13994, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_i1zmfr9", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_5v5kd", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Worst two years of my life.
