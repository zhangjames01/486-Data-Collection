That's the bare minimum \"must have\" mods for PC, they don't alter anything, they just make the game much more stable and fluid. Shouldn't cause a performance hit. If you've got a 64-bit OS, also install the [4GB LAA patch](http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/mods/35262) so the game can use more than 3GB of RAM if it needs to.\n\nIf you're just getting into it, [someguy2000's quest mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/48925) are really awesome. Fully voice acted, and incredibly fun. Once you get to a point where you want to fully overhaul the combat system, [Project Nevada](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40040) is really great. It rebalances pretty much everything and adds some new gameplay mechanics. It's fully configurable through the [Mod Configuration Menu](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507), so you can tailor the difficulty to your tastes.\n\nTo get the whole process down, Gopher has put together [an entire playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0E5E8CA384409B11) to help people learn the general mod installation workflow, including finding and fixing conflicts between mods and getting UI mods to play nice with each other.\n\nLast but not least, if you want to get really hardcore and also own a copy of Fallout 3, [Tale of Two Wastelands](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/) will let you take all the assets from FO3, and install them as a mod on top of FO:NV. You can play through both games on the improved NV engine, with most of the new mechanics backported to FO3. The only tricky part is the compatability patches and high likelihood of needing to go in there with FNVEdit to fix complicated conflicts.\n\nThere are tons of mods I've missed, but you can get an idea of what's out there by browsing Gopher's youtube channel, he did dozens of videos showcasing some of the best mods out there for FO:NV.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, grab and install &lt;a href=\"http://nvse.silverlock.org/\"&gt;New Vegas Script Extender&lt;/a&gt;, then install &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635\"&gt;New Vegas Anti Crash&lt;/a&gt; (adds exception handlers to prevent crashes, makes the game super stable), and &lt;a href=\"http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34832\"&gt;New Vegas Stutter Remover&lt;/a&gt; (fixes the &amp;quot;microstutter&amp;quot; bug that&amp;#39;s been around since Oblivion).
