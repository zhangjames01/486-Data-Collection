Time for my obligatory rant on how everyone was too busy being butthurt to understand the literary brilliance of King's address to the reader. Gather 'round children, gather 'round, /u/Conjohn1899, /u/NoeJose and see if I can't change your minds.\n\nI want to begin by addressing the fact that Stephen King is not the type of author who would let a shoddy ending be published, particularly for his magnum opus. Nor would his publisher allow it, no matter how much clout he may have earned by being one of America's most celebrated authors.\n\nIf we accept that this was not the result of laziness or being pressed for time we have to accept that the ending, including the jarring self-insert's warning, was *deliberate*. Now we just have to ask *why*.\n\nAnd that *why* is because King is intentionally drawing a parallel between the reader and Roland.\n\nRoland's journey is defined by obsession. The Tower is what drives him above all else and beyond reason. He is consumed with it and is as powerless to swear off his quest as he is to stop breathing. Time and time again he is given chance after chance to give up on the Tower, warned that it will bring nothing but sorrow, but he persists. He cannot imagine getting *so close* and just...stopping. He is filled with a need to see it to its conclusion.\n\nSo when Roland finally gets to the end, King steps in and *gives us the same choice*. He tells us to leave with a happy image in our head, to imagine success and happiness for Roland, because what actually follows in the final pages of the book *is not a happy ending*.\n\nAnd even though we've watched Roland make the wrong choice time and time again, even though we've condemned him for it, we simply cannot wrench ourselves away and make the choice he couldn't. After all, we've been with him for so long. We've felt his pain, his determination, seen the sacrifices he's made. How *dare* he ask us to just walk away after all that?\n\nSo, just like Roland, *we make the wrong choice*. We walk on, heedless of the warnings. Our determination and obsession to see it through to the end, despite the assurance that *it will not end well*, perfectly mirrors Roland's state of mind. Just like him we've invested too much to turn back and just like him we ignore the warnings and push forwards.\n\nBut it's even deeper than that. The last few books show us how the Keystone World, *our world*, has an affect on the story. It's why King wrote himself in, so that the *story itself* could be in danger. \n\nSo what would happen if you, living in the Keystone World, stopped reading the book when King asked?\n\nAnything could happen. Roland could reach the Tower and find his ka-tet miraculously revived. It could have the happy ending King assures you doesn't exist, *if you only stop reading and let your imagination finish the trip*.\n\nBut you're just like Roland, unable to walk away from certain disaster. You continue reading and he walks through the field of roses. You keep reading and he confronts the Crimson King. You keep reading and he ascends the Tower. You keep reading and he's back in the desert.\n\n*Your inability to stop reading actively condemns Roland to his fate.* The cycle can only end if you listen to the warnings.\n\nBut you can't. Roland can't.\n\nAnd so the man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed...", "edited": 1505245226.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh hey a Dark Tower thread?
