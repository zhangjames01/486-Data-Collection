Both of those statistics are wrong. When you account for Americans who aren&amp;#39;t first generation Asian, (which is what that statistic usually quotes) America is 10-12 percent Asian. And while it is true that about 5.3% of actors in Hollywood are Asian, less than one percent of all leading actors are Asian. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reason for outrage? That&amp;#39;s up to you.
