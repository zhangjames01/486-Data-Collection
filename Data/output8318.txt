question. Atheism is, by definition, a belief that God does not exist. \"Non-belief\" is something subtly different, and is more appropriately attributed to agnostics as it entails both a lack of assertion and denial. To label oneself atheist is not simply to not belief in the existence of God, but also to believe in the nonexistence of God.\r  \n\r\n\nThat's not the definition most atheists use, and you might find more success actually listening to the people you want to learn from rather than telling them what they believe.\n\nThere are two axes: \"knowledge\" and \"belief.\" Along the knowledge axis, we have gnostic and agnostic. Along the belief axis, we have theist and atheist. It's possible to be an agnostic theist, for example. Agnosticism is not a halfway point between belief and nonbelief, it answers a different question.\n\nYou're claiming that atheism \"by definition\" means we have a positive claim that God does not exist. That only applies to some of us. For most of us, atheism is simply a lack of belief in a God or gods (agnostic atheism). Some of us go farther. I consider myself an agnostic atheist in general terms, but gnostic when it comes to specific god claims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;1) What is your concept of God? Through what religion did you come to form this conception? Was this from reading scriptures, or through interactions with members of that faith?\r\n\nTheism is the belief in at least one deity, particularly a creator-god who made the universe. Because I live in the Western world, typically if someone talks about capital-G \"God\" with no other qualifiers, they're talking about the Christian version of an old man with a long beard living in the clouds, so that's my starting point. But if I learn the other person is talking about something else, I pivot accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;2) If you were not an atheist your whole life, what pushed you to become one? Was it the people who engaged with it? The institution which provides the \"right\" interpretation of it? This interpretation? The scripture which constitutes it? Or something else?\r\n\nI had a bone to pick with Creationists. They showed up often in the communities I was hanging out in, for some reason. The atheists in the community were the best at tearing them down. I was never a particularly strong believer, but they forced me to examine my own beliefs and reconfigure accordingly, and soon I counted myself among their number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;3) How have you gone about constructing your moral/ethical base? Has this been something that you thought out and reasoned with? Or has it been more of a matter of \"feeling it out,\" on a day by day basis? Do you have a clearly defined set of principles, or do you engage with morality/ethics only when it is unclear what you should do?\r  \n\r\n\nMorality is *intersubjective*, which means we come to general agreement as a society. Because we're a social and communal species. We all agree, I hope, that slavery is wrong, because we've come to collective agreement on that. We don't need to reason through it (although we certainly can!), it's something we don't even need to think about, because we've been taught that way by our parents and our media.\n\nMore complex questions -- the classic trolley problem as a good example -- might require some reasoning through.\n\nIn general, though, I hold to [Scott Clifton's statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWNW-NXEudk) from... good lord, 12 years ago? Time is a lie: \n\n&gt;A particular action or choice is moral or right when it promotes happiness, well-being, or health, or it somehow minimizes unnecessary harm or suffering, or it does both.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A particular action or choice is immoral or wrong when it somehow diminishes happiness, well-being, or health, or it somehow causes unnecessary harm or suffering, or again it does both.\n\nPretty straightforward and covers most bases.\n\n&gt;4) What are your thoughts on the issue of causality (i.e., that if every event/thing has a cause, there must have been a first, causeless cause)?\r  \n\r\n\nIt's a nonsensical statement. If we accept as true that everything has a cause (I do not, but I'm pretending), then there *cannot* have been an uncaused cause, because that violates the claim that \"everything has a cause.\" All the second statement is, is an exception to the first statement. Creating an exception is special pleading. If there's one exception, why not many? Why must anything need a cause? The argument instantly unravels unless you're invested in a particular version of that uncaused cause.\n\n&gt; How do you feel about the notion of something from nothing?\n\nWhen most people ask about \"something from nothing\" they're proposing a sort of *philosophical* nothing, a complete absence of everything, even the fabric of spacetime. We have no evidence that this philosophical nothing is even possible, so it's not really worth considering right now, in my opinion.\n\nThe closest thing we have to \"nothing\" is the fabric of spacetime. But even \"empty\" spacetime *does* have energy to it, so it's not completely \"nothing.\" And when you zoom in on a quantum level, spacetime is a roiling, boiling mess. And just as bubbles may form in boiling water, and droplets of water might get tossed up in the air, empty space is constantly generating [virtual particles](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle). These particles are responsible for the Casimir effect and Hawking radiation seen around a black hole.\n\nOh wow, look at that, the universe is full of uncaused events, bubbling forth from nothing.\n\n&gt;5) Why do you think that other people follow religions?\n\nAny number of reasons. A sense of community, a tradition, a lack of exposure to other ideas, indoctrination, they like being told what to do. I'm sure you could ask a dozen people and get a dozen different answers.\n\n&gt; In your experience, what has the reason been for most religious people you know?\n\nNo idea, I don't ask. If they want to bring up the topic I'll engage them, but generally you don't talk religion with your friends if you want to stay friends.\n\n&gt; Do you perceive any legitimacy in the reason of personal experience of the Divine (mystical experiences, deep meditative states, etc.)? Why?\n\nLegitimate in that I believe they experienced something? Sure. Legitimate in that I think it's evidence of divinity? No.\n\nDerren Brown is a UK magician and atheist who had a [\"Messiah\" special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-i_9DOCsEY&amp;ab_channel=DerrenBrown) where pretended to be a believer who could convert people with a touch. Using hypnotic techniques, he gave people what they felt were divine experiences.\n\nSimilarly we're able to generate magnetic fields around the brain which make people feel like they're having an alien visitation or a near-death experience.\n\nThe brain is weird, there are plenty of ways to \"hack\" it to generate specific experiences, and we're all quite capable of inventing elaborate memories based on scant evidence. Personal experiences are evidence, but the weakest form of evidence; generally not worth the paper they're written on.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Agnostic Atheist"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I guess I should have been more specific in my first question.

To label oneself atheist is not simply to not belief in the existence of God, but also to believe in the nonexistence of God.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the definition most atheists use, and you might find more success actually listening to the people you want to learn from rather than telling them what they believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are two axes: &amp;quot;knowledge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;belief.&amp;quot; Along the knowledge axis, we have gnostic and agnostic. Along the belief axis, we have theist and atheist. It&amp;#39;s possible to be an agnostic theist, for example. Agnosticism is not a halfway point between belief and nonbelief, it answers a different question.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re claiming that atheism &amp;quot;by definition&amp;quot; means we have a positive claim that God does not exist. That only applies to some of us. For most of us, atheism is simply a lack of belief in a God or gods (agnostic atheism). Some of us go farther. I consider myself an agnostic atheist in general terms, but gnostic when it comes to specific god claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1) What is your concept of God? Through what religion did you come to form this conception? Was this from reading scriptures, or through interactions with members of that faith?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Theism is the belief in at least one deity, particularly a creator-god who made the universe. Because I live in the Western world, typically if someone talks about capital-G &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; with no other qualifiers, they&amp;#39;re talking about the Christian version of an old man with a long beard living in the clouds, so that&amp;#39;s my starting point. But if I learn the other person is talking about something else, I pivot accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2) If you were not an atheist your whole life, what pushed you to become one? Was it the people who engaged with it? The institution which provides the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; interpretation of it? This interpretation? The scripture which constitutes it? Or something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a bone to pick with Creationists. They showed up often in the communities I was hanging out in, for some reason. The atheists in the community were the best at tearing them down. I was never a particularly strong believer, but they forced me to examine my own beliefs and reconfigure accordingly, and soon I counted myself among their number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3) How have you gone about constructing your moral/ethical base? Has this been something that you thought out and reasoned with? Or has it been more of a matter of &amp;quot;feeling it out,&amp;quot; on a day by day basis? Do you have a clearly defined set of principles, or do you engage with morality/ethics only when it is unclear what you should do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Morality is &lt;em&gt;intersubjective&lt;/em&gt;, which means we come to general agreement as a society. Because we&amp;#39;re a social and communal species. We all agree, I hope, that slavery is wrong, because we&amp;#39;ve come to collective agreement on that. We don&amp;#39;t need to reason through it (although we certainly can!), it&amp;#39;s something we don&amp;#39;t even need to think about, because we&amp;#39;ve been taught that way by our parents and our media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More complex questions -- the classic trolley problem as a good example -- might require some reasoning through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, though, I hold to &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWNW-NXEudk\"&gt;Scott Clifton&amp;#39;s statement&lt;/a&gt; from... good lord, 12 years ago? Time is a lie: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A particular action or choice is moral or right when it promotes happiness, well-being, or health, or it somehow minimizes unnecessary harm or suffering, or it does both.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A particular action or choice is immoral or wrong when it somehow diminishes happiness, well-being, or health, or it somehow causes unnecessary harm or suffering, or again it does both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward and covers most bases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4) What are your thoughts on the issue of causality (i.e., that if every event/thing has a cause, there must have been a first, causeless cause)?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a nonsensical statement. If we accept as true that everything has a cause (I do not, but I&amp;#39;m pretending), then there &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; have been an uncaused cause, because that violates the claim that &amp;quot;everything has a cause.&amp;quot; All the second statement is, is an exception to the first statement. Creating an exception is special pleading. If there&amp;#39;s one exception, why not many? Why must anything need a cause? The argument instantly unravels unless you&amp;#39;re invested in a particular version of that uncaused cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How do you feel about the notion of something from nothing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When most people ask about &amp;quot;something from nothing&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;re proposing a sort of &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; nothing, a complete absence of everything, even the fabric of spacetime. We have no evidence that this philosophical nothing is even possible, so it&amp;#39;s not really worth considering right now, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The closest thing we have to &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; is the fabric of spacetime. But even &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; spacetime &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have energy to it, so it&amp;#39;s not completely &amp;quot;nothing.&amp;quot; And when you zoom in on a quantum level, spacetime is a roiling, boiling mess. And just as bubbles may form in boiling water, and droplets of water might get tossed up in the air, empty space is constantly generating &lt;a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle\"&gt;virtual particles&lt;/a&gt;. These particles are responsible for the Casimir effect and Hawking radiation seen around a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh wow, look at that, the universe is full of uncaused events, bubbling forth from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;5) Why do you think that other people follow religions?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any number of reasons. A sense of community, a tradition, a lack of exposure to other ideas, indoctrination, they like being told what to do. I&amp;#39;m sure you could ask a dozen people and get a dozen different answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In your experience, what has the reason been for most religious people you know?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No idea, I don&amp;#39;t ask. If they want to bring up the topic I&amp;#39;ll engage them, but generally you don&amp;#39;t talk religion with your friends if you want to stay friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you perceive any legitimacy in the reason of personal experience of the Divine (mystical experiences, deep meditative states, etc.)? Why?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Legitimate in that I believe they experienced something? Sure. Legitimate in that I think it&amp;#39;s evidence of divinity? No.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Derren Brown is a UK magician and atheist who had a &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-i_9DOCsEY&amp;amp;ab_channel=DerrenBrown\"&gt;&amp;quot;Messiah&amp;quot; special&lt;/a&gt; where pretended to be a believer who could convert people with a touch. Using hypnotic techniques, he gave people what they felt were divine experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly we&amp;#39;re able to generate magnetic fields around the brain which make people feel like they&amp;#39;re having an alien visitation or a near-death experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The brain is weird, there are plenty of ways to &amp;quot;hack&amp;quot; it to generate specific experiences, and we&amp;#39;re all quite capable of inventing elaborate memories based on scant evidence. Personal experiences are evidence, but the weakest form of evidence; generally not worth the paper they&amp;#39;re written on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_11n4m7x", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "light", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/11n4m7x/questions_for_atheists/jbmtrdl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/11n4m7x/questions_for_atheists/", "name": "t1_jbmtrdl", "author_flair_template_id": "7661f784-4842-11e8-ae3f-0ef42c198ad4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/DebateAnAtheist", "author_flair_text": "Agnostic Atheist", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1678421233.0, "created_utc": 1678421233.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#b8001f", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/11n4m7x/questions_for_atheists/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Good system to emulate classic mmos", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "rpg", "link_author": "Zealousideal_Top_361", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "jbi61g7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "VonAether", "num_comments": 19, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_jbghv6o", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_48j3v", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Created by Sword &amp; Sorcery Studios, an imprint of White Wolf.\n\nThey did an EQ RPG, EverQuest 2, Warcraft, and World of Warcraft, so lots of inspiration from real MMOs.
