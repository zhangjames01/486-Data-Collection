But if anyone is interested, I\u2019ll just leave it as is. The fact is that I was obsessed with the theatrical cut of the film long before there was any other version. And I then read *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* for an into philosophy class in college. So I\u2019ve thought about this more than anyone would generally need to. \n\n From what I\u2019ve read, PKD\u2019s research into the Nazis while writing *The Man in the High Castle* led him to his concept of androids in *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*\n\nSpecifically, he ran across the idea that Nazis lacked empathy (which is sort of a general psychological hypothesis about sociopathy).\n\nHe subsequently wrote *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* by following the idea that, certainly, if our society were being infiltrated by beings who looked and acted just like human beings in every way, but lacked empathy, then these \u201candroids\u201d would be considered a scourge to be eliminated. But, wouldn\u2019t the people who were tasked with hunting these androids get worn down by the job and start to lose their own empathy? And wouldn\u2019t that turn them into androids themselves?\n\nAnyway, I think that basic premise explains a lot about the development of Blade Runner. For instance, PKD recognized that the movie basically flipped his whole concept of androids 180 degrees and initially was vehemently opposed to the movie being made. But when he saw the actual early footage, he changed his mind, because he felt that Ridley Scott had somehow understood exactly how he had visualized what he had been writing about. But if you look at Blade Runner and Alien, Scott has this idea that androids are really superior to human beings, but limited by design. \n\nThe book and the movie are therefore very different but strongly related, often by being opposed around the concept of empathy. For instance, the test for android status is an \u201cempathy\u201d test, which made the transition from the book to the movie. But the \u201cmood organ,\u201d which is a device people use to dial in and experience a specific emotion, was in the book but not the movie. And the sense is that people use this device because they are too jaded and emotionally dead to just feel things naturally from their experiences. \n\nThe whole idea that it would be somehow difficult to distinguish human beings and androids is part of the conceptualization of androids *for the book*. That\u2019s why the empathy test is such an important plot device. But it\u2019s not a part of how we think about robots or cyborgs. And it would have been easy to write about androids differently. (That\u2019s where the later idea comes up, that Weyland decided to develop mechanical artificial life because Tyrell\u2019s biological replicants turned out so disastrously. And you see the idea of the \u201cempathy test\u201d take on new meaning in Blade Runner 2049.)\n\nAnd, trying to avoid spoilers, I\u2019ll just finish up by saying, that all this leads to the big question, originating from the fans, about who is a replicant and who isn\u2019t a replicant. Now, that specific issue arises in the movies, IMO, just as a residuum of the way Ridley Scott flipped PKD\u2019s idea of androids.\n\nThat is, *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* really is about the idea that an android hunter would be in danger of becoming an android himself.

First, it contains a currently relevant and popular social commentary. Second, it took a lot of care in production to achieve a particular look that is both reminiscent of a certain historical period and additionally related to the previously mentioned social commentary. Basically, it looks gritty, because it\u2019s set in a time of economic recession, and talks about current economic issues like wealth disparity, which is both relevant but also super popular, because it feeds into populism. \n\nAnd third, it is a sort of anti-genre film, in some sort of dialectical relationship with a genre (comic book or superhero movies) that the Academy doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge. It\u2019s not just an elevated, meta comic book movie like Watchmen, or a \u201cdark and gritty\u201d comic book movie like Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It\u2019s a full-on super villain movie that puts up a mirror between the villain and society, blah blah blah etc.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that those elements make the movie better or worse. I think it\u2019s a fine movie. Joaquin Phoenix has been amazing in a lot of films, but there are obvious reasons why a lot of people saw this one. It also has great visual style and great sound and great casting. I enjoyed it, a lot of my friends love it, and so forth.

They love to elevate a movie that contains a liberally-slanted populist social commentary that is too obvious for even the casual movie goer to miss. They love to implicitly put down a genre of media they sort of hate by recognizing the one thing that implicitly criticizes it. This will be the one \u201csuperhero\u201d movie they point to when they say they don\u2019t look down on superhero movies. \n\nSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to the film to just start a negative circle jerk about how The Joker \u201cwasn\u2019t really that great, I mean Phoenix was good, but...\u201d.  It\u2019s definitely more than that. And all of that stuff is implicit to the film and contributed to its popularity with both movie goers and the Academy.

The Academy is 110% biased. \n\nI\u2019m just glad Joaquin Phoenix is getting recognition for a risky decision, and I hope it will lead to more great roles for him.

First, it contains a currently relevant and popular social commentary. Second, it took a lot of care in production to achieve a particular look that is both reminiscent of a certain historical period and additionally related to the previously mentioned social commentary. Basically, it looks gritty, because it\u2019s set in a time of economic recession, and talks about current economic issues like wealth disparity, which is both relevant but also super popular, because it feeds into populism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And third, it is a sort of anti-genre film, in some sort of dialectical relationship with a genre (comic book or superhero movies) that the Academy doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge. It\u2019s not just an elevated, meta comic book movie like Watchmen, or a \u201cdark and gritty\u201d comic book movie like Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It\u2019s a full-on super villain movie that puts up a mirror between the villain and society, blah blah blah etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not saying that those elements make the movie better or worse.

IMO, this is the Achilles heel of science fiction for the general audience. Exposition comes out in the text, in narration, in dialogue, and in imagery. But it operates at the expense of other elements, like character development, natural conversation, and dramatic conflict. Perhaps most of all, it takes up time, which is a precious resource especially in a film. \n\nSome people like exposition, and some tolerate or ignore it. But others really don\u2019t like it. Furthermore, low levels of exposition correspond with audience uncertainty, ambiguity, etc. And individuals also vary in their enjoyment of those things. These sorts of individual differences are really wrapped up in the extent to which people are interested in science fiction at all. A lot of people will enjoy an action movie or a monster movie in a science fiction setting. But a film will lose some of those people if they need to absorb bad dialogue to understand what will turn out to be a critical piece of plot development for the entire film. \n\nThe setting of Dune is very dissimilar to our world. It has essentially no continuity. It is set thousands of years in the future. Critical elements of technology are totally implausible and frankly trippy. It shares many qualities with Golden Age science fiction, like faster than light travel and psionic abilities. While some people criticize the David Lynch version for reasons having to do with exposition, I think this is just part of the nature of the source material. If you haven\u2019t read the book, it\u2019s difficult to understand the movie. If you have read the book, you have to appreciate what did manage to get into the movie or else feel like certain things were left out. \n\nJust to give some other examples of exposition in science fiction films, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Prometheus have very limited exposition. People who like them tend to say they like the mystery presented in those films, they enjoy speculating what they meant and watching them again and again, etc. In contrast, Christopher Nolan is well known for his exposition. He wants to use clever plot devices to tell a complex story, but he also wants to reach mass audiences and have commercially successful films that justify their large budgets. His exposition often results in awkward dialogue. Some hardcore fans like to obsess over the cognitive elements of his world building. The Tarkovsky version of Solaris is very light on exposition in spite of being three hours long. The Soderbergh version of Solaris focuses on half of the book\u2019s content, turning it into a sort of a romance-suspense movie that is more audience friendly, but it is low on visual effects and a lot of the science fictional setting. And, IMO, neither film version even touches on the most interesting elements of the book (specifically, it\u2019s critique of scientific method and the scientific profession), even though the book itself is not very long. \n\nSecond, Dune really has built into it an extensive element of internal monologue. Basically, huge sections of the text involve reading what certain characters are thinking to themselves. This is related to the first point, because a large amount of the exposition is worked out in these internal monologues. At the same time, because the book features psionic abilities, the heavy use of internal monologue has more than just a narrative function. It is really built into the development of the plot. \n\nWhat this leads to in film or television is a lot of voice-over interludes, where the actors are making faces and then later go on to record an all voice performance in a sound studio that is edited in later, superimposed over the filmed performance. This can be minimized to some extent given the kind of time they had for the tv miniseries. But for a film, we\u2019re talking about maybe 35 or 40% of the film being wrapped up in this technique. It would be like a Terrence Malick film \u2014 which would be great, if you had Terrence Malick\u2019s production team and never expected make back most of the money put into the film\u2019s special effects budget. \n\nFinally, I\u2019ll end by saying that I have a high degree of confidence that Villeneuve can make this film. But based on his other films, he has a high tolerance for mystery and relative lack of verbal exposition. How he manages that balance with what commercial success seems to demand (large amounts of exposition and action with very low ambiguity) is an open-ended question at this point. \n\nSpeaking of commercial viability, I think one thing Redditors overlook is that the popularity of the source material can carry the international market. Basically, any high-end production of a book that is a widely translated classic piece of literature is a guaranteed success in much of the world. This is the one kind of movie that can only come from Hollywood and that most people have a predisposition to see in the theater \u2014 Lord of the Rings, The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland, and Les Mis\u00e9rables for example. Even Titanic could fit in that category, not because of the screenplay, but because of the infamy of the event and the huge budget required to pull it off visually.  So when people say things like, \u201cI have no idea how Alice in Wonderland made so much money,\u201d it\u2019s because any legitimate and adequately expensive attempt to make it has a built in international audience. \n\nAt the same time, it still is the case that a movie can\u2019t be a blockbuster unless it carries the US audience. That may change not long from now for maybe a future Chinese or Indian film. Maybe this will be like BR2049, where there is less interest in turning a fast profit. But that in itself is a true rarity. \n\nSo what\u2019s interesting to me will be to see what kinds of choices Villeneuve makes in adapting Dune with respect to comprehensibility and the use of internal monologue, and how he will approach the US audience in particular. \n\nJust to be clear, IMO, Dune is nearly impossible to adapt to film or television such that would be enjoyable to people in the same way or to the same extent as the book.

That is, he is just as good, just as bad, just as limited, just as good looking, just as athletic, etc., in every single film he\u2019s appeared in. There\u2019s almost no variability in his skill or his effort. Anything anyone puts on his movies has nothing to do with any sort of scandal or drug use or whatever. It\u2019s all about his career arc, IMO. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to see what started it all for Costner, I would recommend No Way Out. He was an unknown in a thriller that was really pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_aindd6", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aindd6/waterworld_4k_restoration_trailer/eeq60mh/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/aindd6/waterworld_4k_restoration_trailer/", "name": "t1_eeq60mh", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1548198153.0, "created_utc": 1548198153.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://youtu.be/r4LLyBCz9tw"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "The Criterion Collection Edition of 'The Tree of Life' Isn't Just a Director's Cut.

And that\u2019s not something that I imagine is obvious to fans. But the reality is that if fans obsess over every detail of established content, they are going to have a tendency to be reactionary towards any new content. In a lot of ways, fandom is about preserving a feeling. Fans re-enact dialogue or dress up as characters in order to re-produce and share whatever strong emotions they experience in relation to the object of their fandom. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s a moving boundary around what gets designated as \u201cclassic\u201d material versus \u201cnew\u201dmaterial. I\u2019m sure some sociologist or anthropologist either has or could develop a model for this kind of phenomenon. Fandoms are complex. There are forces that make a fandom a cohesive entity, and there are forces that make them internally diverse. For example, any Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who, or Alien fan can explain why one of those things appeals to them more than the others, and people within any one of those fandoms will mostly agree with one another about that. But when it comes to individual movies, episodes, or books within those franchises, fans will have diverse opinions. And all of this evolves, depending on how actively new material is being released. For instance, it used to be a very different thing to be a fan of Blade Runner, before cyberpunk, than it was when the cyberpunk anime genre was established. And it\u2019s different yet again because of BR2049. \n\nAnd that leads to my second point. There\u2019s always a commercial interest in marshalling a fandom when it comes to releasing new material, while at the very same time producers are attempting to create new fans and appeal to more casual consumers. And that can be very complicated, because traditionally fandom is a sort of grassroots phenomenon. It\u2019s a way by which people establish a sense of ownership over something solely on the basis of how it makes them feel and how they\u2019ve accepted it into their lives.  In many cases, a fandom is especially devoted to an original storyteller or creator. Fans don\u2019t necessarily want there to be more commercial, more popular, or more accessible material. Being a fan is somewhat exclusionary. \n\nAt the same time \u2013 and this is just my personal observation \u2013 fans are not very good at predicting what the fandom as a whole will like or dislike in the future. They are great at consuming and dwelling on existing material, but their conservatism is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, if new material strays too far from whatever they think makes the classic material great, they will reject it, because it encroaches on the sense of value the classic material has for them. On the other hand, if they get what they say they want, then the new material can\u2019t really live up to the classic material, and they will be disappointed in that way. I think media producers have started to figure out that they can\u2019t literally just ask fans what they want and then deliver it. The whole procedure is actually very difficult. \n\nNaturally, there will be many fans who have more nuanced opinions. But I think the processes and group dynamics underlying fandom produce a more extreme division into two camps. In other words, it is the *function* of a fandom to determine how the group as a whole responds to new material. And so, whenever new material is produced, resolving this \u201ccrisis\u201d becomes the primary preoccupation of the fandom. \n\nFinally, conventions and social media have changed all of this. Fandom used to be something that occurred mostly in person. Conventions produced a sense of camraderie. Online forums concentrated the dissemination of information and discussion into a more efficient but less personal mode. And then the commercial interest in conventions and social media have made this whole process more interactive, between fans and content producers. On top of that, social media enables much more direct text communication, but in a sort of lopsided way that is attended by all sorts of strange social attitudes and behaviors. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to complain about the latest movie in a conversation with your friends, or in a \u201cfan club\u201d (if those exist anymore), or on a fan forum website with other users. It\u2019s another thing to feel like you have the right to \u201cshare your opinion\u201d directly with a film director or actor on Twitter or Facebook. There\u2019s an inherent disparity at play there. The film director is not at all anonymous. One individual among one million followers is practically anonymized. A disgruntled fan who would never threaten or denigrate someone in person might do so on social media, because it doesn\u2019t seem to be in the same category of social interaction. \n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s a reason why a director might have a million followers online, which is directly related to their role in a commercial endeavor attempting to appeal to a fandom. It\u2019s not inherently safe to interact with any sort of established institution, especially an institution that is based on such unregulated group behaviors like a fandom. \n\nI guess you could tie this in with the distinction between being \u201cchild-like\u201d and being \u201cchildish.\u201d Fandom, like hero worship, has a lot to do with child-like excitement, feelings of awe or wonder, the resolution of anxieties, the development of aspirations, and so forth. That\u2019s why disgruntled fans often claim that the latest movie \u201cruined their childhood.\u201d And that makes them angry. So some of them lash out. \n\nAnd I think we hear about this sort of thing more, not just because it might be happening more, but because it\u2019s happening on social media, and because it affects people personally when they\u2019re attacked on social media, and because there is a lot of socio-cultural stuff in play on social media, like the changing racial composition of the country, the extent to which movies should promote racial diversity, how well or badly they might be doing that, etc. I think it\u2019s clear as well that there are \u201cinterlopers\u201d \u2013 people who hijack the normal processes of fandom to create mayhem, psychological harm, and controversy, and to express their cultural insecurities. All of that to some extent has some legitimate value as news, but it also becomes fodder that feeds social media and online consumption in a viscious circle. Social media has really upped the ante in terms of narcissism and its role in culture. Probably every advance in media technology has done that though. \n\nMy personal view is that we need to step back from all this a bit. There are plenty of socially cohesive elements of fandom that make them valuable and worthwhile. If we become so insecure that we feel that we all need to agree because otherwise our sense of self-worth is damaged, that\u2019s what drives toxic fandom, IMO. People who express themselves by directing hate speech at individuals online obviously have something more going on with them than their disappointment with the latest Star Wars or Alien movie.

And it\u2019s different yet again because of BR2049. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that leads to my second point. There\u2019s always a commercial interest in marshalling a fandom when it comes to releasing new material, while at the very same time producers are attempting to create new fans and appeal to more casual consumers. And that can be very complicated, because traditionally fandom is a sort of grassroots phenomenon. It\u2019s a way by which people establish a sense of ownership over something solely on the basis of how it makes them feel and how they\u2019ve accepted it into their lives.  In many cases, a fandom is especially devoted to an original storyteller or creator. Fans don\u2019t necessarily want there to be more commercial, more popular, or more accessible material. Being a fan is somewhat exclusionary. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time \u2013 and this is just my personal observation \u2013 fans are not very good at predicting what the fandom as a whole will like or dislike in the future. They are great at consuming and dwelling on existing material, but their conservatism is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, if new material strays too far from whatever they think makes the classic material great, they will reject it, because it encroaches on the sense of value the classic material has for them. On the other hand, if they get what they say they want, then the new material can\u2019t really live up to the classic material, and they will be disappointed in that way. I think media producers have started to figure out that they can\u2019t literally just ask fans what they want and then deliver it. The whole procedure is actually very difficult. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, there will be many fans who have more nuanced opinions. But I think the processes and group dynamics underlying fandom produce a more extreme division into two camps. In other words, it is the &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; of a fandom to determine how the group as a whole responds to new material. And so, whenever new material is produced, resolving this \u201ccrisis\u201d becomes the primary preoccupation of the fandom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, conventions and social media have changed all of this. Fandom used to be something that occurred mostly in person. Conventions produced a sense of camraderie. Online forums concentrated the dissemination of information and discussion into a more efficient but less personal mode. And then the commercial interest in conventions and social media have made this whole process more interactive, between fans and content producers. On top of that, social media enables much more direct text communication, but in a sort of lopsided way that is attended by all sorts of strange social attitudes and behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s one thing to complain about the latest movie in a conversation with your friends, or in a \u201cfan club\u201d (if those exist anymore), or on a fan forum website with other users. It\u2019s another thing to feel like you have the right to \u201cshare your opinion\u201d directly with a film director or actor on Twitter or Facebook. There\u2019s an inherent disparity at play there. The film director is not at all anonymous. One individual among one million followers is practically anonymized. A disgruntled fan who would never threaten or denigrate someone in person might do so on social media, because it doesn\u2019t seem to be in the same category of social interaction. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there\u2019s a reason why a director might have a million followers online, which is directly related to their role in a commercial endeavor attempting to appeal to a fandom. It\u2019s not inherently safe to interact with any sort of established institution, especially an institution that is based on such unregulated group behaviors like a fandom. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess you could tie this in with the distinction between being \u201cchild-like\u201d and being \u201cchildish.\u201d Fandom, like hero worship, has a lot to do with child-like excitement, feelings of awe or wonder, the resolution of anxieties, the development of aspirations, and so forth. That\u2019s why disgruntled fans often claim that the latest movie \u201cruined their childhood.\u201d And that makes them angry. So some of them lash out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I think we hear about this sort of thing more, not just because it might be happening more, but because it\u2019s happening on social media, and because it affects people personally when they\u2019re attacked on social media, and because there is a lot of socio-cultural stuff in play on social media, like the changing racial composition of the country, the extent to which movies should promote racial diversity, how well or badly they might be doing that, etc. I think it\u2019s clear as well that there are \u201cinterlopers\u201d \u2013 people who hijack the normal processes of fandom to create mayhem, psychological harm, and controversy, and to express their cultural insecurities. All of that to some extent has some legitimate value as news, but it also becomes fodder that feeds social media and online consumption in a viscious circle. Social media has really upped the ante in terms of narcissism and its role in culture. Probably every advance in media technology has done that though. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My personal view is that we need to step back from all this a bit. There are plenty of socially cohesive elements of fandom that make them valuable and worthwhile. If we become so insecure that we feel that we all need to agree because otherwise our sense of self-worth is damaged, that\u2019s what drives toxic fandom, IMO. People who express themselves by directing hate speech at individuals online obviously have something more going on with them than their disappointment with the latest Star Wars or Alien movie. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_93lrks", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/93lrks/about_toxic_fandom/e3ecios/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/93lrks/about_toxic_fandom/", "name": "t1_e3ecios", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/movies", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1533103816.0, "created_utc": 1533103816.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/93lrks/about_toxic_fandom/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Is modern Star Wars too self-referential?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "movies", "link_author": "discipleofdoom", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dw59wag", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "GhostofTrundle", "num_comments": 1723, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_dw4uelr", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_5yyd8", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I touched on this in a response to someone else.

The first time I heard about it was a quote from JJ Abrams himself.\n\nOther than what I said about it in association with online communities and social media, I do think it has the risk you pointed out. I enjoyed Fringe quite a lot, but there was a period of time when it seemed like they were struggling to tie up loose ends. It got to the point where they had to explain something in interviews. (Specifically, they ended up pointing out how the mystery about the guy in the dream world who Olivia recognized as the guy who was going to kill her was *technically* resolved in such and such a way, that was not immediately obvious.)

But they don\u2019t have a specific plan in advance. \n\nI think it makes sense that this type of device would become effective with the rise of online communities and social media. It\u2019s basically impossible to get a large fan base to watch every episode of a 22-episode series in order unless something is driving them along, and so communication and speculation among fans, the use of fan conventions, and all of that stuff that drives fan theories play a big role in the success of a serial. \n\nThe false mystery technique as applied In The Force Awakens was very self-referential, maybe to an absurd degree. Where is Luke? Why is he in self exile? Why does R2-D2 have PTSD? How did Luke\u2019s old lightsaber get recovered? Why does Maz have it in a box in her basement? Why did it respond to Rey? Who are Rey\u2019s parents? Why did they leave her alone on Jakku? Were they associated with the rebels? Were they force sensitive? How did Kylo get Vader\u2019s helmet? Who are the Knights of Ren? Who is Snoke and where does he come from? Etc.\n\nThe movie did actually answer a subset of the questions it raised, mostly related to family relationships among Han Solo, Leia, and Ben Solo. But the rest of the questions were left deliberately to future writers and directors of the sequels. \n\nI think the best way to look at the way The Force Awakens was constructed is to see it as trying to do two things \u2013 first, to re-establish and reassure the existing community Star Wars fans that a continuation of the old films are possible, and second, to acquire new fans among the younger generation. They needed to utilize established characters, plot points, and themes, but they needed to quickly establish new characters and plot points that would be the new focus of the series. And they needed to do all that in one two-hour movie. \n\nIn The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson took a lot of \u201cmysteries\u201d that were handed down to him and sort of blew them up.

First, it caused a lot of consternation among a group of fans who had been speculating and creating theories. Second, the series, which had been \u201cself-referential\u201d with respect to the older material, became more \u201cmeta.\u201d TFA was about re-establishing an iconography, while TLJ was about iconoclasm. \n\nMy point is that these two results are really emblematic of how pop culture works in this particular moment. Social media is conducive to iconography and iconoclasm. Companies need to cater to fans, but many fans prefer the activity of speculation and sharing fan theories to accepting plot resolutions from producers and show runners. \n\nFinally, I think it\u2019s worth understanding what Disney is doing in general. Disney thrives on capturing and promoting a certain way of looking at childhood, and reinforcing that sentiment from one generation to the next. If you liked the original animated film as a kid, then maybe you\u2019ll take your kids to see the Broadway musical version and the live action movie version and then ride the rides at the theme park. And then they\u2019ll grow up and do the same thing with their kids. \n\nThat means that, as an adult Star Wars fan, you\u2019re only going to get so far in offering criticism of the new Star Wars movies. Why is Rey orphaned on a desert planet just like Tatooine, and why does the Millennium Falcon happen to be right there at the same time, and why is that the very same place where Poe Dameron meets someone to acquire crucial information who is immediately killed by Kylo Ren before we even find out who he was? Well, a kid doesn\u2019t care about having an explanation for that sort of coincidence. Space opera in particular is a genre that thrives on absurd coincidences that we\u2019re not supposed to think about. \n\nAs to the question you raised, I think a counter question is whether Star Wars can be anything without self reference, without the risk of become a completely generic space fantasy setting. The first six movies basically comprised one story, about how a republic becomes an empire, about how fathers are redeemed by their children, about the US involvement in SE Asia, etc. George Lucas built up the setting to tell that story. \n\nNow that the story is told, what is left of the setting that can be used to tell new stories? I agree that the new movies have become very self-referential, but that\u2019s a problem only in the absence of a strong narrative to take the place of the old one. I think TFA lacked that strong narrative, but it fulfilled other important tasks for the franchise.

Both had elements of grand adventure stories sort of projected onto SF, with magical powers, princesses, savages, scantily-clad women, etc.\n\nSo I just think there\u2019s a question of the extent to which the space opera setting is an entrenched in adolescence, or vice verse. I mean, the association is both a blessing and a curse. Many of the SF classics evoke a childlike sense of wonder and contain a sort of simplified moral code. Others are invariably referred to as being \u201cphilosophical.\u201d And the rest of them are basically thrillers or action movies or dystopian dramas. I just wonder if there\u2019s much commercial appeal in a more mature Star Wars movie, mostly due to the limits of the commercial movie industry itself and the production costs of SF films. \n\nI\u2019m sure a few people mentioned Rogue One, which is essentially a war movie set in the Star Wars universe. It blurred the distinction between good and evil and all that, and it limited the significance of the Force. How significant was it to be set in the Star Wars universe? Well, it occupied a particular place in the fictional timeline that lent it inherent interest to fans, just like a typical war movie would have been. And I think that\u2019s part of the limits associated with space opera. There generally has to be some sort of epic storyline. In other words, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s straightforward to create just any movie plot and set it meaningfully in the Star Wars universe, as opposed to some other generic SF setting. For example, some people mentioned something like a Star Wars horror film. But there\u2019s no particular reason why something like that would need to be a Star Wars movie. Mature movies are generally set on a small scale, I think. \n\nAnyway, these are just my musings on the subject. I do think Rogue One was surprisingly \u201cadult.\u201d And Solo is going to be some sort of heist movie. This gets back to the question of genre and the extent to which SF is essentially derivative. Maybe something like a spy thriller would work. But if you had a great screenplay for an R-rated movie like that, why bother to set it in space and pay all the extra money for production? It would have to have some sort of conceit that was really uniquely tied to the Star Wars setting, IMO.

For example, some people mentioned something like a Star Wars horror film. But there\u2019s no particular reason why something like that would need to be a Star Wars movie. Mature movies are generally set on a small scale, I think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these are just my musings on the subject. I do think Rogue One was surprisingly \u201cadult.\u201d And Solo is going to be some sort of heist movie. This gets back to the question of genre and the extent to which SF is essentially derivative. Maybe something like a spy thriller would work. But if you had a great screenplay for an R-rated movie like that, why bother to set it in space and pay all the extra money for production? It would have to have some sort of conceit that was really uniquely tied to the Star Wars setting, IMO. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_82fpxy", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/StarWars/comments/82fpxy/serious_question_would_anyone_else_here_want_a/dvb1t7b/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/82fpxy/serious_question_would_anyone_else_here_want_a/", "name": "t1_dvb1t7b", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/StarWars", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1520398105.0, "created_utc": 1520398105.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/rox5i1ixp5k01.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Classic movie recommendations for teenage boys?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "movies", "link_author": "TheTurtleWhisperer", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "duw4ddf", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "GhostofTrundle", "num_comments": 56, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_80i7nr", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5yyd8", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Jupiter Ascending got a lot of hate.
