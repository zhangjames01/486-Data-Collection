It's incredibly expensive to live, and IT jobs generally pay substantially below the national average.\n\nMost businesses in Hawaii are small, so they have 1-2 IT guys at most. There are a few large providers (HawaiianTel, Pacxa, WorldWideTech, etc)  that do pay well, as well as a few large companies (HMSA, Queens, bunch of the banks, etc)\n\nBut outside of that it is hard.\n\nDOD contracting is def an option if you have clearance but it's year to year contracting generally. That does pay pretty well.\n\nOverall it is just hard due to the insane coat of living. \n\nIf you don't have a support system there already or a high paying job that you can do remotely from there, or a large nest egg or very in demand skill set, I would strongly advise against it.\n\nNote: I saw you have an A+. 1000% do not move unless you can just live with your parents indefinitely.
