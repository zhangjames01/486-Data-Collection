textiles, including caring for them. \n\nIt's only really in the past century or two that laundry _isn't_ a huge, multi-day, backbreaking chore for people all over the world. Stain removers and soaps/detergents loosen dirt, etc., but what removes most of the dirt is agitation. Today, many people have washing machines to do this for them, but if you don't then you have to physically get the dirt out by scrubbing or even beating it out of the fabric. \n\nYour ancestors probably *were* bleaching white fabrics, because that's the only way to keep them white long-term. The most common bleaching agents throughout human history are lye, urine, and the sun. Lye is just wood ashes and water. Urine can be collected and allowed to sit to convert more of it to ammonia. Both of these loosen stains (especially greasy stains), and laundry would often be left to sit in a bath of lye or stale urine for a day before it was boiled and scrubbed. The sun similarly can bleach white fabrics as they hang dry, but that assumes there's no rain and takes longer than the chemical bleaching. \n\nAs you can see, laundry without mechanical help is a dirty, labor-intensive, and often disgusting job. But provided you can physically do the work, it's very approachable, requires very little training, and has low startup costs--which made it a very, very popular job for poor women. Plenty of women would take laundry in to wash, either with their own family's laundry or as their primary source of income. The more well-off you were, the less likely it was you did your own laundry; you either sent it out to one of these washer women and paid by the piece/by weight, or may even employ servants to wash it in-house. \n\nNow to your fabrics. There are two big qualities separating these--their weave (loose vs dense weave), and maybe the quality of the wool that goes into them. Part of a fabric's strength comes from the density of its weave, so if the weave is loose then more of the stress is on individual threads. A thread's strength is a combination of the thread's thickness (thicker= stronger) and the length of the fibers being spun together (longer = stronger). Longer fibers can be spun into finer thread without making the thread too weak. And, because wool is a natural fiber, only so much of each fleece will be those nice, long fibers. Finer threads also require more skill to spin if being done by hand. Finer threads are also nicer/softer to wear next to the skin. Short fibers make fuzzy thread, and that fuzziness can be itchy. \n\nOk, what about the boiled wool? Wool is interesting--if we looked at its fibers up close, we'd see little 'scales'. Water (especially hot water) opens up those scales to allow things like dirt or stains (or dyes!) in, but also means that if you agitate the fibers those scales start locking together, shrinking and felting. Boiled wool takes advantage of wool's tendency to felt to make a very dense, warm fabric. And because those scales are all locked together, water/dirt/stains have a harder time getting into the fibers and becoming permanent. Often, dry dirt can just be brushed off because it can't get a good grip on the fiber. And because felted wools are denser, the strength of the cloth isn't affected as much by the thread strength and the thread can use a lot more of the shorter, cheaper wool fiber. \n\nAnd finally, the not-actually-asked question--**what to do about this stained white wool cloak?** First, try scrubbing the stain (carefully, to avoid felting the wool) to see if agitation is what you needed. If that doesn't help, use a stain remover that is designed to work on whatever made the stain before trying to wash again. Modern bleach is chlorine-based and will destroy or degrade many fibers, including wool, and should be avoided at all costs.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies if it feels like my answer jumps all over the place--you have a lot of really awesome questions here that go into the history of textiles, including caring for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only really in the past century or two that laundry &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; a huge, multi-day, backbreaking chore for people all over the world.

If you were up here for college, you probably didn&amp;#39;t get as much of a taste of the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also suggest renting up here for a year before buying, both to give you time to figure out what you want (and find it!) and let your fianc\u00e9e get established in a job locally. Part of mortgage underwriting involves examining your income and how stable the underwriter perceives your employment to be. While it&amp;#39;s definitely not impossible to get a mortgage with a recent job change (especially in the same line of work), it can complicate the process if that job change was more recent than 6 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_10hfzrc", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/personalfinance/comments/10hfzrc/is_it_a_dumb_move_to_move_from_a_low_col_area_to/j5axsjl/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10hfzrc/is_it_a_dumb_move_to_move_from_a_low_col_area_to/", "name": "t1_j5axsjl", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/personalfinance", "author_flair_text": "\u200b", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1674323787.0, "created_utc": 1674323787.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10hfzrc/is_it_a_dumb_move_to_move_from_a_low_col_area_to/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qm6c", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Gifting regret", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 41, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "crochet", "link_author": "Spanish_Glitter", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j51dtm7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "kuudereingly", "num_comments": 225, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_j50fgp7", "score": 41, "author_fullname": "t2_a3ct1", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "She may even recognize and appreciate the effort and know she can't appropriately honor that (because it's not to her tastes and it's meant to be worn), and that's why she offered it back to OP rather than donate it or shove it in a closet never to be enjoyed.\n\nGifting apparel is *really* hard to get right, and the fact that it's handmade gives the gift an emotional charge that an off-the-rack garment wouldn't have.
