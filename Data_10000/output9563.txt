Ask about everything you are unsure of. Those first couple weeks every other partner will expect you to ask, and you should. It&amp;#39;s the people that don&amp;#39;t ask and don&amp;#39;t try to learn that are annoying when they ask about what they should have learned in their first month 6 months in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never worked at a place more welcoming than Starbucks. I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s my store (although i worked at another store and experienced similar things) but I felt welcomed and accepted there. Some people are hard to work with, yes, but over all I would say people will want to seek out the best in you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_87owp1", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "light", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/starbucks/comments/87owp1/im_a_brand_new_green_bean_and_im_panicking/dwemb07/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/87owp1/im_a_brand_new_green_bean_and_im_panicking/", "name": "t1_dwemb07", "author_flair_template_id": "9e5f4afa-ab9b-11e7-8df9-0eac3236b770", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/starbucks", "author_flair_text": "Supervisor", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1522215555.0, "created_utc": 1522215555.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "#006341", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/87owp1/im_a_brand_new_green_bean_and_im_panicking/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qwza", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Is my GM correct about making drinks while I'm DT?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "starbucks", "link_author": "Maymuy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "dvy523l", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "cyclemichael", "num_comments": 12, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_85jbo0", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_5ntts", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "From what I've experienced it depends on the time and the kind of store you are at.
