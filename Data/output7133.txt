Sober or not. He was called 7 win sark for a reason.\n\nPersonally, as someone who has lost loved ones to drunk drivers it kind of pisses me off that everyone is making excuses for this bastard. Multiple people have told stories about him getting in the car drunk off his ass and driving away, watching him leave thinking \"he's not actually driving in that state is he?\". You're right, alcoholism does ruin families. Because fucking losers like Sarkisian are the reason millions of families are without loved ones. They drive drunk amd kill people, they beat their children and their spouses, they become burdens on their family. The alcoholic is the one that does these things. It's their choice to do it.\n\nFirst and foremost I feel bad for their victims. The absolute last person on the list I'll feel sorry for is an alcoholic who lets it get to such a point that it messes up life for others.\n\n\nYou can call it a disease all you want, cancer is a disease, Parkinson's is a disease, this is a decision he made (and don't bring up the ADA to me, that law has been used for more bullshit frivolous lawsuits than any law I can think of). \n\nThere are millions of people with the genetic predisposition for alcoholism who fight back the urges and don't become drunk fuckups who ruin their marriage and their career. There are many more that recognize they're getting too far off the wagon and decide to pull back. You never hear about those people, you only hear about the selfish fuckups who have no willpower.\n\nI don't understand why everyone here wants to kiss his ass so much. He has done nothing to actually show he isn't a fuck up. He doesn't get brownie points from me for potential. When he is actually clean for awhile then we'll talk.\n\nUntil then I only feel sorry for the players who wanted to play for a coach that could further their career, and instead they got a drunk fuck up.\n\nMaybe those players deserve more than having a person who was supposed to be a role model showing up drunk to meetings. Maybe they deserve more than having a man that was supposed to help them win showing up drunk to games.\n\nI feel sorry for the fans that wanted to see their team get back on track and instead had to deal with this shit show because their AD was too up his own ass to realize the warning signs.\n\nIt's not like Sark just fell off the wagon, and oh no he's such a good guy, it's totally out of character for him.. hes been a drunk for years. He never took ANY steps to fix it until he was absolutely forced to.\n\nHe deserved to lose his job.\n\nHe's not a child. He made his choice. At any point in time he could've checked himself into rehab. This is something that has built up over years.\n\nDuring one of the times he drove him drunk, if he had killed someone no one would be saying \"oh poor sark. That mean ole alcoholism made him do it.\"\n\nFuck him. Respect is earned. All I see is a man who spit in the face of every opportunity he was given. Who spit in the face of every kid who trusted him to lead them. A mediocre at best coach. A grown ass man who needs to be led around like a little child because he couldn't control himself.\n\nSpurrier drank a lot. He still did his job, and knew what needed to be done.\n\n\nRespect is earned. He has shown nothing implying he deserves any pat on the back, idk why this sub wants to give it to him.\n\nNo coach deserves to coach again less than Sarkisian right now. He has to earn that. If he can work his way back up to the level of a normal coach, then good for him, but to be honest his problems are entirely of his own doing. No one put the bottle in his hand and forced the alcohol down his throat.\n\nHe has to have some responsibility for that, because taking the \"he couldn't help it, it's a disease. Poor guy\" argument to its logical conclusion then no one is responsible for anything they do, free will wouldn't exist. Every decision they make is the result of their genetically inherited brain chemistry and their environment. Let all criminals out of jail, no one should be held accountable for anything they do ever.\n\nSark made his choice. He was being paid millions and he had every single opportunity a man could ask for.\n\nHe got himself his dream job. It's his own fault he lost it\n\n\nThere are dozens of up and coming coaches trying to break into the big time. They deserve a shot before he does, because unlike Sarkisian they haven't shown that they are incapable of being a responsible adult.\n\n\n---\n\nThose players deserve better. Those fans deserve better. Sarkisian does not deserve better. He made his choice. I do not respect someone that spits in the face of so many people that trusted him.\n\nI hope he gets better, but honestly I hope he is never a head coach again. Because honestly, he doesn't deserve it. He had his chance. Dozens of other guys deserve their shot over him. He showed everyone he was completely incapable of dealing with the pressures of that job. Maybe he'll be fine as an assistant, but not a head coach. If you think that many parents would want their child to play for a man like that you're delusional.

Sober or not. He was called 7 win sark for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, as someone who has lost loved ones to drunk drivers it kind of pisses me off that everyone is making excuses for this bastard. Multiple people have told stories about him getting in the car drunk off his ass and driving away, watching him leave thinking &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s not actually driving in that state is he?&amp;quot;. You&amp;#39;re right, alcoholism does ruin families. Because fucking losers like Sarkisian are the reason millions of families are without loved ones. They drive drunk amd kill people, they beat their children and their spouses, they become burdens on their family. The alcoholic is the one that does these things. It&amp;#39;s their choice to do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First and foremost I feel bad for their victims. The absolute last person on the list I&amp;#39;ll feel sorry for is an alcoholic who lets it get to such a point that it messes up life for others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can call it a disease all you want, cancer is a disease, Parkinson&amp;#39;s is a disease, this is a decision he made (and don&amp;#39;t bring up the ADA to me, that law has been used for more bullshit frivolous lawsuits than any law I can think of). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are millions of people with the genetic predisposition for alcoholism who fight back the urges and don&amp;#39;t become drunk fuckups who ruin their marriage and their career. There are many more that recognize they&amp;#39;re getting too far off the wagon and decide to pull back. You never hear about those people, you only hear about the selfish fuckups who have no willpower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why everyone here wants to kiss his ass so much. He has done nothing to actually show he isn&amp;#39;t a fuck up. He doesn&amp;#39;t get brownie points from me for potential. When he is actually clean for awhile then we&amp;#39;ll talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then I only feel sorry for the players who wanted to play for a coach that could further their career, and instead they got a drunk fuck up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe those players deserve more than having a person who was supposed to be a role model showing up drunk to meetings. Maybe they deserve more than having a man that was supposed to help them win showing up drunk to games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel sorry for the fans that wanted to see their team get back on track and instead had to deal with this shit show because their AD was too up his own ass to realize the warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like Sark just fell off the wagon, and oh no he&amp;#39;s such a good guy, it&amp;#39;s totally out of character for him.. hes been a drunk for years. He never took ANY steps to fix it until he was absolutely forced to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He deserved to lose his job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s not a child. He made his choice. At any point in time he could&amp;#39;ve checked himself into rehab. This is something that has built up over years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During one of the times he drove him drunk, if he had killed someone no one would be saying &amp;quot;oh poor sark. That mean ole alcoholism made him do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck him. Respect is earned. All I see is a man who spit in the face of every opportunity he was given. Who spit in the face of every kid who trusted him to lead them. A mediocre at best coach. A grown ass man who needs to be led around like a little child because he couldn&amp;#39;t control himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spurrier drank a lot. He still did his job, and knew what needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Respect is earned. He has shown nothing implying he deserves any pat on the back, idk why this sub wants to give it to him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No coach deserves to coach again less than Sarkisian right now. He has to earn that. If he can work his way back up to the level of a normal coach, then good for him, but to be honest his problems are entirely of his own doing. No one put the bottle in his hand and forced the alcohol down his throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He has to have some responsibility for that, because taking the &amp;quot;he couldn&amp;#39;t help it, it&amp;#39;s a disease. Poor guy&amp;quot; argument to its logical conclusion then no one is responsible for anything they do, free will wouldn&amp;#39;t exist. Every decision they make is the result of their genetically inherited brain chemistry and their environment. Let all criminals out of jail, no one should be held accountable for anything they do ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sark made his choice. He was being paid millions and he had every single opportunity a man could ask for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got himself his dream job. It&amp;#39;s his own fault he lost it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of up and coming coaches trying to break into the big time. They deserve a shot before he does, because unlike Sarkisian they haven&amp;#39;t shown that they are incapable of being a responsible adult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those players deserve better. Those fans deserve better. Sarkisian does not deserve better. He made his choice. I do not respect someone that spits in the face of so many people that trusted him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope he gets better, but honestly I hope he is never a head coach again. Because honestly, he doesn&amp;#39;t deserve it. He had his chance. Dozens of other guys deserve their shot over him. He showed everyone he was completely incapable of dealing with the pressures of that job. Maybe he&amp;#39;ll be fine as an assistant, but not a head coach. If you think that many parents would want their child to play for a man like that you&amp;#39;re delusional. No AD would touch that mess with a ten foot pole.
