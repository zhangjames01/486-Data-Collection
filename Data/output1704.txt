Fromm is a good food, for sure. Many of its formulae do include grains, but the first ingredients in its Four-Star line are all real meat, so that's a plus. They do offer grain-free foods, but unfortunately the price goes up quite a bit for those ones. If you can occasionally buy the grain-free ones (say every 3 months or so), that's a good way to keep costs down while still incorporating a bit of a healthy kick in your dog's diet.\n\nHaving a young dog is very advantageous. If he were on the same food for say, five years, it would be much more difficult to switch. It's not really a good idea to keep a dog on the same food for too long a time. I recommend switching the protein at least once a month. Variety is a great thing for dogs; it allows them to get a more complete nutrient balance by using multiple sources, it significantly lowers the chance of them developing allergies or sensitivities to a specific protein (or grain or any other food), and it keeps them from getting bored!\n\nIf, as some dogs do, he has a sensitive tummy, you can try adding a pro-biotic to his food during the diet switching process. Your pet store should carry digestive supplements which can help make the transition easier. But being so young, I wouldn't expect a healthy normal dog to have much difficulty. Diarrhea for a day or two can occur, the best way to treat that is with a bit of canned unsweetened pumpkin for extra fibre; it's like Metamucil for dogs!\n\nWhat you can do is buy a new kibble every month, and near the end of one bag, start mixing in a new kibble (about a 90:10 ratio of old:new the fist day, 80:20 the second day, and so on, until you're feeding all new food). Another good thing to switch it up and keep costs down is to keep requesting free samples at your pet food store. Often they'll keep samples of many brands on hand to offer to people looking to switch foods.  Ask to try some grain-free types every time you visit the pet store, and you can use those as an occasional meal to keep things interesting for your pup. If your dog is used to a rotational diet, usually introducing a new food is not difficult on his system, so it's okay (and, in fact, healthy!) to throw a different food in here and there.\n\nI would also recommend throwing in some non-kibble when possible, just make sure he doesn't get too used to fresh home-cooked delicious food or else he won't want to eat kibble! Canned food is a great non-kibble meal too, Merrick makes really good stuff for dogs, as does PetKind, First Mate, Go!, and Wild Calling. \n\nThe only \"danger\" of occasionally feeding non-kibble is that he might decide he doesn't want to eat kibble, and if that happens, know that it's okay for dogs to go a day without eating (the same does NOT apply to cats!). If he won't eat his kibble, take it away after 15 minutes and try it again at the next mealtime. Eventually he'll get hungry enough to eat it. \n\nAs an aside, if you do ever decide to add an element of raw into his diet, make sure to allow at least 10-12 hours between feeding kibble and raw, as raw processes much more quickly than kibble and raw needs to be able to pass through the dog quickly for optimum health.
