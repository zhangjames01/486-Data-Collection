Some of my college friends know, but that's about it. People here on campus are really great and accepting about sexuality, but I was very closeted at the beginning of the year and didn't join any LGBT groups which I regret now. At the beginning of my sophomore year in the fall I'm planning to go to more things and be more open about my sexuality to people.\n\nI'd finally gotten around to accepting my sexuality, but for the past year or so I had been pretty happy with only telling people if they ask directly, which it turns out never happens. For a while, that didn't feel like the closet to me, but it is, and it's starting to hurt a lot, even if it took me a while to realize it. I took a history of gender and sexuality class this semester (I'm a feminist, so it wasn't hard to explain to my family without coming out) and I've absolutely loved it. We have mandatory discussion periods every week, and a few weeks ago, the topic of coming out came up when we were talking about gays in the military during World War II. We were talking about the pros and cons of coming out for the soldiers, who would be kicked out of the military dishonorably and socially stigmatized for being gay. I finally raised my hand and said that it seemed to me that staying closeted had personal benefits- you wouldn't be ostracized, and you could keep your job- but that coming out had societal benefits- more awareness generally leads to more acceptance right?- and on my way back to my room, I realized that I had also been talking about myself. I knew I needed to come out, then, in March, but I haven't yet for quite a few reasons.\n\nAs for at home, I'm from a really rural southern area and religion is a big part of the culture there, so coming out is pretty difficult. I didn't date at all in high school, mostly because I was really into academics, but also because my way of dealing with my sexuality was just repressing everything. I'm 19 now, and I didn't really come out to myself until I was 17 if that gives you any indication. I was really involved in a church youth group during high school, and a lot of my best friends were made that way. We're still in touch, and I *definitely* haven't told them yet, especially my closest friend, who's pretty homophobic. For example, a bunch of us had a Christmas party over break, and somehow or another mistletoe was obtained and people were having a normal, obnoxious time with it. She was laughing along with everyone else until the mistletoe got hung over two boys. She totally closed off and went into another room. It was kind of the worst. I'd really like to tell her, along with the group of girls from my youth group, but I'm not sure I can stand the idea of them totally shutting me out, which I have a strong gut feeling is what would happen.\n\nHowever, the real reason I'm still closeted is my family. My mom and dad are very active in the church in our community, so that worries me, but they've also both been disgusted at the people who kick their kids out for coming out too. I guess it's just that unlike a lot of young people, I have a really good relationship with my family, and specifically my mom, and I'm worried that even if they wouldn't kick me out or hate me, coming out would still ruin that. I love my family a *lot* and I'd really hate to change anything.\n\nMy dilemma currently I think is that I'm scared. A big, deep part of me really wants to come out, but a lot of me is just damn terrified. I don't really know what to do. Neither situation seems like it'll be better, and that sense of hopelessness has been contributing to my anxiety and depression issues a lot recently, to the point where I spend a lot of time by myself, which I don't really want to do.\n\nIf you can help me, reddit, that'd be lovely, but I really just needed to get this off of my chest, so thanks for the internet therapy.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m bi and mostly not out yet.

To get in, you had to be nominated during the spring of your junior year, and then go through a long application process, but it was free and it was a super big deal to get to go. I didn't really expect to get to go, but I thought I'd at least be nominated because I'd been nominated by a teacher who apparently didn't know how old I was when I was a sophomore. The time rolls around, and friends start getting nomination notices during class, and I don't get one. \n\nI'm a little confused, so during lunch I go talk to the counselor. She checks the list, and it turns out none of my teachers thought to nominate me. She's surprised too, and she makes a few calls, but it's not a mistake. We talk about it for a little bit, and in a turn of events that's a little fuzzy now, I start to totally cry. Like, not a few tears, but full out sob. I was pretty stressed at the time, and I have (now-diagnosed) anxiety issues that I didn't know about then, and I just totally had a breakdown.\n\nThe counselor was a sweet lady, but not the best at emotional support, so she let me sit in an empty conference room to cry it out, only the room was filled with canned food that they sent home with the kids who didn't have anything to eat, so I felt bad about the original thing, and bad for feeling bad about such a trivial thing when there were people at my school who were literally starving. Understandably, I couldn't calm down, and the counselor eventually sent in a teacher I was really close with, and we talked and she calmed me down, and it was eventually okay. I still had to go back to class with a big puffy red face, though. Definitely my worst day of high school, and maybe my worst day period.\n\n(if anyone's wondering, I ended up being the only person from my graduating class, and the first person from my school in several decades, to go to an Ivy League school, so it eventually worked out okay, I guess ;))", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So my state had a Governor&amp;#39;s School, which is like a six week academic summer camp. To get in, you had to be nominated during the spring of your junior year, and then go through a long application process, but it was free and it was a super big deal to get to go. I didn&amp;#39;t really expect to get to go, but I thought I&amp;#39;d at least be nominated because I&amp;#39;d been nominated by a teacher who apparently didn&amp;#39;t know how old I was when I was a sophomore. The time rolls around, and friends start getting nomination notices during class, and I don&amp;#39;t get one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little confused, so during lunch I go talk to the counselor. She checks the list, and it turns out none of my teachers thought to nominate me. She&amp;#39;s surprised too, and she makes a few calls, but it&amp;#39;s not a mistake. We talk about it for a little bit, and in a turn of events that&amp;#39;s a little fuzzy now, I start to totally cry. Like, not a few tears, but full out sob. I was pretty stressed at the time, and I have (now-diagnosed) anxiety issues that I didn&amp;#39;t know about then, and I just totally had a breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The counselor was a sweet lady, but not the best at emotional support, so she let me sit in an empty conference room to cry it out, only the room was filled with canned food that they sent home with the kids who didn&amp;#39;t have anything to eat, so I felt bad about the original thing, and bad for feeling bad about such a trivial thing when there were people at my school who were literally starving. Understandably, I couldn&amp;#39;t calm down, and the counselor eventually sent in a teacher I was really close with, and we talked and she calmed me down, and it was eventually okay. I still had to go back to class with a big puffy red face, though.
