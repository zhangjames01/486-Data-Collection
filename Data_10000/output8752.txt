I saw one from week 8 to 12 and realized how much I was overestimating my recovery at 8 weeks once I was more stable.\n\nFor the hunger I totally feel you. I EPed myself and just weened last month at 8 months pp. Expressed milk burns around 20 calories per OZ. Since you are pumping you can exactly know how much need extra to maintain and then start to drop. You can eat at a deficit and maintain supply, but I would not suggest it until you establish your milk supply. Generally that is between 6-12 weeks. You can also look into droping pumps at that time too get yourself more sleep. If you haven't already look at your [magic number](https://www.legendairymilk.com/blogs/news/what-is-your-magic-number?gclid=CjwKCAiAh9qdBhAOEiwAvxIokyh_h1HAH7MrSyVdyegn3G_1I97PsKB0XolHPMixB-nEwT-XZvop_RoCklkQAvD_BwE) to know how much you need to pump to maintain.  If you are not already lurking there r/ExclusivelyPumping was a godsend for me on figuring everything out. The best way for me for managing the hungry was to drink a ton of water and have a lot of small meals, making sure I was actually getting enough food. Sleeping also helped a lot, but considering thats not up to you at this point, I'll stick to the snack suggestion :-).\n\nFor the weight gain/loss, I went through the same thing around this time. It wasn't fat, it was water/milk weight. Your body is still changing so much that the scale is going to bounce big until you hit steady state. I gained within the recommendations, lost about half by 6 weeks and then lost the rest by about 6 months. Through this time, I wasn't able to consistently exercise, it was all diet. I wasn't able to loss more until these past couple of weeks with stopping pumping, having my hunger return to normal and having the time to run again.\n\nOverall, give yourself a bit of grace right now.

They can help you develop a postpartum plan to get you back to full strength. I saw one from week 8 to 12 and realized how much I was overestimating my recovery at 8 weeks once I was more stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the hunger I totally feel you. I EPed myself and just weened last month at 8 months pp. Expressed milk burns around 20 calories per OZ. Since you are pumping you can exactly know how much need extra to maintain and then start to drop. You can eat at a deficit and maintain supply, but I would not suggest it until you establish your milk supply. Generally that is between 6-12 weeks. You can also look into droping pumps at that time too get yourself more sleep. If you haven&amp;#39;t already look at your &lt;a href=\"https://www.legendairymilk.com/blogs/news/what-is-your-magic-number?gclid=CjwKCAiAh9qdBhAOEiwAvxIokyh_h1HAH7MrSyVdyegn3G_1I97PsKB0XolHPMixB-nEwT-XZvop_RoCklkQAvD_BwE\"&gt;magic number&lt;/a&gt; to know how much you need to pump to maintain.  If you are not already lurking there &lt;a href=\"/r/ExclusivelyPumping\"&gt;r/ExclusivelyPumping&lt;/a&gt; was a godsend for me on figuring everything out. The best way for me for managing the hungry was to drink a ton of water and have a lot of small meals, making sure I was actually getting enough food. Sleeping also helped a lot, but considering thats not up to you at this point, I&amp;#39;ll stick to the snack suggestion :-).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the weight gain/loss, I went through the same thing around this time. It wasn&amp;#39;t fat, it was water/milk weight. Your body is still changing so much that the scale is going to bounce big until you hit steady state. I gained within the recommendations, lost about half by 6 weeks and then lost the rest by about 6 months. Through this time, I wasn&amp;#39;t able to consistently exercise, it was all diet. I wasn&amp;#39;t able to loss more until these past couple of weeks with stopping pumping, having my hunger return to normal and having the time to run again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, give yourself a bit of grace right now. You are not fully healed, and your body is still changing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_103uqx4", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/fitpregnancy/comments/103uqx4/how_to_manage_weight_during_breastfeeding/j33toys/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitpregnancy/comments/103uqx4/how_to_manage_weight_during_breastfeeding/", "name": "t1_j33toys", "author_flair_template_id": "2a501e18-904f-11eb-b7a2-0e4df2a2c067", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fitpregnancy", "author_flair_text": "MOD | April 2022 | Rowing", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1672953981.0, "created_utc": 1672953981.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitpregnancy/comments/103uqx4/how_to_manage_weight_during_breastfeeding/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhn3", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "How much time does having a kid take?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 1, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Parenting", "link_author": "saito200", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j2i5emm", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "RowHard", "num_comments": 50, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_100jvae", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_3wufj", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "The answer is more complicated then straight numbers, it's mental engagement level.\n\nIf you do not have a child in daycare, then you are responsible for all hours.
