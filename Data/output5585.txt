IMO if you had someone who pretty much only played JRPGs like Persona 5, Xenoblade 2, and Tales of Arise, collected imported Japanese figures of those game&amp;#39;s characters, and cosplayed characters from those games at conventions, but they didn&amp;#39;t watch anime, that person is still a weeb. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are also a gaming nerd, but their taste in games is skewed towards Japanese ones with anime tropes and the way they express their love for them is identical to the way anime fans do. Someone not invested in either interest wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to tell them apart from an anime fan so I think it&amp;#39;s the same. I think Genshin is trickier because it&amp;#39;s not a Japanese game, but I think it still counts as long as people are behaving in the same way as anime fans towards it since it&amp;#39;s heavily inspired by Japanese games and anime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_yj51w2", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/Hololive/comments/yj51w2/so_this_is_how_it_feels_not_to_be_part_of_the/iunp7gp/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/yj51w2/so_this_is_how_it_feels_not_to_be_part_of_the/", "name": "t1_iunp7gp", "author_flair_template_id": "15bd08ac-f23f-11ea-9afe-0ef49a255fd7", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Hololive", "author_flair_text": ":Kiara:", "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1667327604.0, "created_utc": 1667327604.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/fxwhh70ggbx91.jpg"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_29numb", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "So, this is how it feels not to be part of the circle.", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 44, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "Hololive", "link_author": "horus375", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "iumecp6", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Mazrodak", "num_comments": 421, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_iumbdim", "score": 44, "author_fullname": "t2_71056", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Not even just to shame.
