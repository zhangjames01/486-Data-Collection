What would be the consequences of a tree-free planet? Let\u2019s start with perhaps the most obvious difference \u2013 oxygen concentration.\n\n**A lack of oxygen**\n\nOxygen makes up roughly 21% of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere; half of this oxygen is produced through photosynthesis in trees and other plants on land. The other half is produced in oceans, by microscopic marine organisms called phytoplankton. The environment would not be devoid of oxygen if all trees were lost but the oxygen level would be lower. Would it be sufficient for humans to survive? In one year, a mature leafy tree produces as much oxygen as ten people breathe. If phytoplankton provides us with half our required oxygen, at current population levels we could survive on Earth for at least 4000 years before the oxygen store ran empty. However, that\u2019s not considering a number of other factors: increasing population size, for example, would reduce the amount of oxygen available, whilst phytoplankton blooms due to an abundance of carbon dioxide could increase oxygen levels.  \n\n**Suffocating smog**\n\nWhilst there may be enough oxygen for humans to survive on Earth, at least to begin with, the air we breathe could still be responsible for our demise. Like giant filters, trees help to cut down on pollution levels. Leaves intercept airborne particles and ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and other greenhouse gases are absorbed through the leaves stomata. In 2012, outdoor air pollution was estimated to cause 3.7 million premature deaths worldwidew2. Imagine the impact removing these environmental sieves would have on humankind. Air-pollution masks would become a necessity and bottled \u2018clean air\u2019 could come at a premium.\n\n**Full of hot air?**\n\nArmed with pollution masks, would the climate and temperature still be suitable for us? One important consideration is carbon dioxide. In one year, an acre of mature trees soaks up the same amount of carbon dioxide that we produce by driving the average car 26 000 miles. Since human activities like this increase the normal level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, cutting down trees would tip the balance even further, not to mention the enormous amount of stored carbon that would be released from doing so.\n\nDeforestation is already responsible for up to 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions and you might think that an overwhelming increase in carbon dioxide would result in a much warmer planet. However, the relationship between trees and global temperature is much more complicated.\n\nEnergy and water fluxes between trees and the atmosphere also play a role and a tree\u2019s colour, for example, can affect the amount of the Sun\u2019s energy that is absorbed or reflected. Studies have shown that Europe\u2019s trees have actually caused a slight increase in regional temperatures since 1750, while transpiration from plants in tropical forests cools the surface temperature. Therefore, whether the temperature becomes too hot to handle could depend on many factors, although a recent study concluded that reducing forest size increases average air surface temperatures in all climate zones (Alkama &amp; Cescatti, 2016).\n\n**Rain check**\n\nRemoving trees might reduce rainfall. Lands would quickly dry out as less moisture is returned to the atmosphere, a crucial role of trees in the water cycle. A study in 2012, for example, found that by 2050 destruction of tropical rainforests would reduce rain across the Amazon basin by up to 21% in the dry season (Spracklen et al, 2012). It could also drive significant and widespread shifts in rainfall distribution, affecting agriculture locally and further afield. Without trees we would not only live in a world of widespread drought, but we would likely be exposed to more frequent extreme weather events such as flooding, when it does rain. In which case, our natural, resilient safety buffer would not be there to lessen the blow.\n\n**Substandard soil**\n\nWithout trees and roots to hold soil together, erosion would quickly occur and heavy rains would easily wash soil away. The soil would also be full of dangerous chemicals and pollutants that are normally filtered by trees, so attempting to grow anything on Earth would prove difficult. Plants are the foundation of all food chains. Without trees there would be no paper, no pencils, even no coffee or tea, *but more fundamentally there would also be no food for animals, or us, to eat. And since 70% of the Earth\u2019s land animals and plants live in forests, the majority would lose their habitat*. (italics added)\n\nThe prospect of a world without trees looks very grey (and much less green). Even if we survived on dirty air, endured catastrophic climatic events and found a way to sustain ourselves, would it be a world in which you wanted to live?  \n\n ", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this comment is heavily plagarized from &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceinschool.org/content/world-without-trees\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are about three trillion trees on earth (Crowther et al, 2015), covering 31% of the world\u2019s land surface.

Throughout the rest of Europe, warming was minimal in some places, while cooling was taking place elsewhere including southern europe where the Renaissance started.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With all that established, what of the medieval warm period? Well, the weather was certainly warmer in Northern Europe and in the North Atlantic, but it was colder and more variable in Southern Europe. After roughly 1400 CE, the less stable weather expanded to Northern Europe and both areas cooled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little ice age, on the other hand, was common to most of the continent. The point is that if one used just Northern Europe&amp;#39;s tree ring data, the medieval warm period would look very strong, while Southern European proxies would show no warm period. Only by combining data from throughout Europe can one see just how local the medieval warm period actually was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO the outflux of wealth, culture, and knowledge in the time between the sacking of Constaninople by the crusaders (1200s) to the sacking by the Ottomans (1450s) was the primary fuel of the Renaissance. The Black Death (~1350 in southern Europe) played a part as well as a force of disruption in many ways, creating by death many small vacuums into which new people, new wealth, new ideas flowed. IMO the Black Death made the &amp;#39;cultural soil&amp;#39; fertile for the Byzantine influx that was happening and would continue and increase through the 1450s. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_5w4mk9", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/collapse/comments/5w4mk9/leaf_out_is_20_days_earlier_this_year_across/de8lyks/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/5w4mk9/leaf_out_is_20_days_earlier_this_year_across/", "name": "t1_de8lyks", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/collapse", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1488126196.0, "created_utc": 1488126196.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://i.redd.it/95r524ykw0iy.png"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhw9", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "What's up with the weather?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 2, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "collapse", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "de5svkr", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "slapchopsuey", "num_comments": 28, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_de5n6we", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_3gupr", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "I've seen mating season behavior in canadian geese here in the Chicago area also.
