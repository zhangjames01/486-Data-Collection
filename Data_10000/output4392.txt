Zoo teched in alchemists to deal with doomsayer, but that is pretty much the only change they need to make, and I think Blizzard should force aggro to tech in one or two more tools to reduce their consistency. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cards like Divine Favor just makes aggro paladin incredibly consistent, and insanely overpowered cards like Abusive just lets any aggro deck trade up or push through any control or tempo tool available right now. Where are the 0/8 or 0/12 4 mana taunts? They took out healbot and buffed aggro. Having consistent card draw mechanics that actually benefit the deck just gives aggro every tool without any drawbacks. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_4lfwrz", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/hearthstone/comments/4lfwrz/which_card_do_you_think_has_the_worst_design_in/d3n6a7i/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4lfwrz/which_card_do_you_think_has_the_worst_design_in/", "name": "t1_d3n6a7i", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/hearthstone", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1464459512.0, "created_utc": 1464459512.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4lfwrz/which_card_do_you_think_has_the_worst_design_in/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w31t", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Which card do you think has the worst design in the game?", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 9, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "hearthstone", "link_author": "[deleted]", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d3n5zk0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Snowfox2ne1", "num_comments": 1111, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_d3n334j", "score": 9, "author_fullname": "t2_8ki8f", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Aren't too many spells in shaman that don't have overload, and they can also cancel out overload with up to 4 cards in the deck.
