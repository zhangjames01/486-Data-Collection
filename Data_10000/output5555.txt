Those cases are easily your worst fact because evidently judges don\u2019t really think most loans satisfy the test. As it turns out, in a typical bankruptcy you can\u2019t prove a ~20k loan is an undue hardship for the very good reason that it simply isn\u2019t. In a typical bankruptcy youre rarely liquidating *all* debts and *all* assets. So it seems like the obvious answer is that student loan debt just hangs around because it\u2019s not a large amount for the vast majority of people who declare bankruptcy and have student loan debt and it\u2019s implied by those numbers. \n\nI feel like your response has ignored my statement: \"You might reply that it is not worth it for 20k of debt, but what about the 20% of students (no small number!) that have an excess of $40k? If \"undue hardship\" only required a little work to prove, then I would expect many, many more than 213 people to have done it.\" But let's unpack your response a little more.\n\nYou are right, loan amount is indeed a selection bias. The mean and median debt amount of the 213 people is plausibly greater than the 169,774 people because a larger debt, coupled with the right circumstances that show an inability to pay, make it more likely to get at least a partial discharge of student debt. However, you seem to be implying that the loan selection bias that whittles the number from 169,774 to 213 is because the 169,774 have only $20k in debt. I suspect that the 169,774's median debt is higher than the $20k median debt of the general debtor population because, after all, this 169,774 are applying for bankruptcy. There are a variety of factors that cause people to declare bankruptcy, but an obvious one is usually the amount of debt. \n\nBefore we start haggling over whether the median debt of this 169,774 group is $20k or $21k or $30k or whatever, let's talk about what these numbers mean. The median individual income in the U.S. is about $33k. $17k is a *lot* of money for a *lot* of people. $20k is. $40k is. The course of peoples' lives can and do change over this amount of money. (Decreasing home ownership, increasing suicide amongst the young, etc. are not effects that are happening in a vacuum.) Whatever the median debt of this 169,774, they decided to file for bankruptcy, and I think it is plausible that the majority of them went through a fair bit of suffering (financial, psychological, or otherwise) before they made that choice. It's embarrassing and feels like an admission of failure, and it costs more money for lawyers, time and effort to figure out legal options and file paperwork, all coupled with the uncertainty of the consequences (what property will I lose? which debt will get discharged? how can I make finances work with terrible credit for the next 7 years?).\n\nThere is a difference between the *legal standard* of \"undue hardship\" and what is causing lifelong damage to people's ability to make a living and cover their needs. You seem to look at the 169,774 people and say \"since most of them were judged not to meet this legal standard, therefore their debt problem must not be that significant\". All I see are people that declared bankruptcy, many of which who are likely suffering, and very few of which will be able to escape it anytime soon. I am not questioning whether people have meet the legal standard; I am questioning the legal standard itself. I think I also made this point in my previous comment: \"...when a 50-year-old can make irresponsible decisions with credit cards and more easily discharge that debt than an 18-year-old just trying to get an education, the playing field is not level.\" I assume the legal standard fits under current law and precedent, but is it fair and just? Does it make sense? Is it good for society? I think it is not. Perhaps the solution lies not with changing bankruptcy law but changing other aspects of how we fund college (or, more likely, a combination of aspects), but the point is that the current situation is hardly just or fair for the 18-year-old.\n\nAnd let's not forget the points I made about rising college costs and how that pressure can be felt even when an individual's student debt is unchanged.\n\n&gt; If we\u2019re talking about student loan debt, the value of the debt is the best way to discuss because, well, that\u2019s the subject\n\nNeither of our positions is about numbers by themselves. Monetary numbers do not exist in a vacuum. They connect with goods and services, the value of which is ultimately based on how we value, at a more element level, having shelter or food or the transportation that allows us to visit mom or whatever. To argue that these numbers do pose a societal problem is, to some degree, an evaluative judgment. To argue that these numbers do *not* pose a societal problem is, to some degree, an evaluative judgment. You have argued that student debt is not a societal problem because the median debt is $17k and that only a small percentage of people have significantly more debt, with your overall comments clearly implying that it is not a societal problem because $17k is not a lot of money and the higher debt held by a minority of people does not point to any systemic problem across society. Those are evaluative claims. They can be backed up facts and numbers that help us connect them to some reasonable common ground of value, but they are not entirely divorced from those evaluations. We are not just doing math here. I have argued that there is a bigger picture than just the median debt figure than suggests a real societal problem. I will let the reader decide whether there is some substance to that bigger picture.\n\nI hope you do not feel attacked. I try to remind myself that, *sub species aeternitatis*, we are not unlike a pair of ancient humans debating whether the sun is a burning lump of coal or carried by a divine chariot.

By doing things this way, you keep the ability for smaller states to have extra representation while lessening the likelihood that the popular vote will de-sync from the electoral vote. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_93dcmg", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/93dcmg/what_sounds_wrong_but_is_right/e3d42h5/", "subreddit_type": "public", "link_permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/93dcmg/what_sounds_wrong_but_is_right/", "name": "t1_e3d42h5", "author_flair_template_id": null, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1533060332.0, "created_utc": 1533060332.0, "awarders": [], "all_awardings": [], "locked": false, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "quarantine": false, "mod_note": null, "link_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/93dcmg/what_sounds_wrong_but_is_right/"}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2si92", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "link_title": "Where the world's people live, by economic status", "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "ups": 4, "num_reports": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "MapPorn", "link_author": "Prince8888", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "e2y1pbc", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "wheremydirigiblesat", "num_comments": 415, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_e2xgc27", "score": 4, "author_fullname": "t2_6g55l", "over_18": false, "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "If it's $33k PPP (purchasing power parity), then it is what $33k buys for the average person.

Next time you clean out all your old stuff, take pictures of anything that has significant sentimental value, regardless of whether you plan to keep it or give it away. Scan all your old photos and convert your old home movies to digital format. (Even scan pages of a yearbook, if it matters enough to you.) They are companies that can do this for you, or you can get a decent scanner for $100 and do it yourself.\n\nOnce you have all this digitized, it is easier to back it up in multiple places (like you should be doing with all your other computer files). Consider using a cloud backup service (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_online_backup_services)).

Next time you clean out all your old stuff, take pictures of anything that has significant sentimental value, regardless of whether you plan to keep it or give it away. Scan all your old photos and convert your old home movies to digital format. (Even scan pages of a yearbook, if it matters enough to you.)
